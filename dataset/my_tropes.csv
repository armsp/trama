TropeID,Trope,Description
t00079,AbusiveParents,"Parents are supposed to be the protectors of children, but these parents are either so damaged themselves that they can't do the job, greedy or villainous to the point that they never had any interest in doing the job properly, or would rather use the child as a means to an end. Sometimes they're just sadistic assholes.
This includes parents who are emotionally, verbally, physically, or mentally abusive, or who neglectfully allow their children to be abused by others if they don't abuse the child themselves; sexual abuse is typically treated as a special kind of evil. Sometimes, the abuse at the hands of their parents becomes a Freudian Excuse for a villain. Other times, the character manages to not grow up broken, bitter, and hateful, and instead a different and better person than the upbringing would incline one to think. Troubling Unchildlike Behavior is often a tell-tale sign that things are not right at home.
Abusive Parents are commonplace in fairy tales and Classical Mythology which makes this trope Older Than Feudalism. Note that The Brothers Grimm, when they collected European fairy tales, were uncomfortable with the idea of Abusive Parents and so frequently changed the Abusive Parents in the traditional stories into abusive step parents.
Sometimes, a parent will go as far as to kill the child in question, in which case this is Offing the Offspring. In other ways cases, the parent's abuse occasionally drives the offspring to snap, commit Revenge and finally kill them, thus becoming a Self-Made Orphan. Although other times, the parents end up as a
Karma Houdini. Calling the Old Man Out occurs when a fed-up child retaliates with a ""The Reason You Suck"" Speech. If the child gets out of the broken family and forms healthy friendships, but reacts badly when their abusive parents show up again, well, Friends Are Chosen, Family Aren't.
Bear in mind that not everyone agrees on the line between actual abuse and merely heavy-handed parenting (or even normal parenting). Is Moving the Goalposts merely inspiring the child to achieve more, or the most insidious form of abuse to instill mistrust and paranoia to the children? Some include spanking as abuse; others think it's appropriate given certain guidelines. Some believe it's okay to make a kid go without a meal (they won't starve that easily); others disagree. Making a kid miss a friend's birthday sleepover — is that emotional abuse? Raising a kid without exposure to TV? Telling your daughter she's getting fat? A little friendly name-calling? There's a line here somewhere, but not everyone agrees on where it is.
If a parent has just dumped the child, for whatever reason, that's Parental Abandonment; if they aren't paying attention, that's Parental Neglect. If the parents refuse to discipline their kids, they are Pushover Parents. Contrast Mama Bear or Papa Wolf (where others abuse the children and the parents abuse the abusers), and the more extreme variant of Knight Templar Parent, where the abusive parent is violently overprotective. Abusive Precursors can be considered this on a metaphorical level. See Hilariously Abusive Childhood for when this is cranked up to absurd levels and played for laughs. Black Comedy is often connected in the comedic aspect of it, and a Big, Screwed-Up Family may be involved if it is adult comedy. In keeping with the above note, some may call the show on it and say Dude, Not Funny!. See Evil Matriarch and Archnemesis Dad for characters who are beyond abusive and outright evil. For parents who are mostly abused by their children, see Pushover Parents. Abusive-type parents are mostly wanted criminals being chased by the law.
While they do not have to be the child's actual, technical parents to be part of this trope, it's pretty important that they are closely related and live together, like a Wicked Stepmother or an Evil Uncle taking care of the Parentally Deprived. After all, it's much more disgusting that somebody related to the child could bring themselves to hurt them, rather than a mere foster family.
The polar opposite, of course, are Good Parents.
NOTE: Please do not use this trope for complaining about parents you don't like.
Unfortunately, Abusive Parents are Truth in Television and a very sensitive topic for many, so please no Real Life examples - it is sufficient to say they do exist and they are all too common."
t00190,ActionGirl,"An Action Girl is a female badass who is tough and kicks butt. Damsel in Distress? Not her. She's featured in far more than the Designated Girl Fight. She faces dangerous foes and deadly obstacles, and she wins.
For the longest time in many cultures, Double Standards in both fiction and real life meant that when it came to action and fighting, guys definitely outnumbered girls. Men Act, Women Are was the rule of thumb, which led to the Action Girl being a subversion of what was acceptable. As society has marched on, this view has faded in some media, leading to stories where Action Girls become the norm rather than the exception, such as stories set in a World of Badass, and especially a World of Action Girls.
The broad Action Girl concept can take many forms. Faux Action Girl is a case of presenting a character as this, only for them not to live up to the standards of this trope. Dark Action Girl is the villainous variety, and Affirmative Action Girl is a cast addition intended to balance out gender ratios that typically also falls under this trope. Less action-y versions include You Go, Girl! and Plucky Girl.
This is somewhat of a Cyclic Trope, with Action Girls often having surges in popularity in the 1940s, 1970s, 1990s and 2010s, probably not coincidentally times when the women's movement increased in prominence.
See below for even more subtropes and other variants.
Not to be confused with Action Girl, a comic series about an Action Girl. For advice on how to write these types of characters, see Write An Action Girl.

Genres and worlds populated by Action Girls:"
t00263,AdaptationDistillation,"Some adaptations take a complex character or situation and greatly simplify it, removing elements the producer believed to be unnecessary. This effect is more common when adapting from a long-running series, especially if it hasn't had a singular vision over the years.
Compare Compressed Adaptation, which deals more along the lines of a direct adaptation and is about all the stuff that is cut out along the way to make this trope happen.
Contrast with Pragmatic Adaptation: in a distillation, a complex story is simplified, without much substantive change. In a Pragmatic Adaptation, the story is changed with the shift in medium. Also, contrast Adaptation Expansion, which tacks on more content but retains the original source material. When a story element is removed but its effects aren't, that's Adaptation Explanation Extrication.
This isn't about adaptations that are better than the original. This is about elements that are simplified or removed in order to make an adaptation shorter."
t00265,AdaptationExpansion,"This is the complete opposite of Compressed Adaptation. It occurs when a short, very simple tale is given a much bigger adaptation, typically as a feature-length film. To be brought up to feature length, the storyline will have to be padded with some new stuff — a lot of new stuff. Cue Alternative Character Interpretations that require elaborate backstories, minor characters given much larger parts, completely new characters, and sometimes Plot Holes, Plot Tumors, and a triple dozen subplots that were not in the original work.
This has a tendency to make the story unrecognizable as a retelling of the original. In some instances, the original story will end up as one small part of a much larger, more convoluted story. This will usually be the climax, in which case the film essentially gave you an hour or more of Back Story. This most often happens with movies based on novellas, short stories, video games or children's books. In the children's books instance, this can lead to the introduction of Darker and Edgier into a normally benign story or the reintroduction of elements lost to Disneyfication of classic stories.
While this trope is often associated with the fan complaint ""They Changed It, Now It Sucks!!"", it can be done well. Remember that Tropes Are Tools and extensions for adaptations might need to happen to fill the required runtime, just going about it right is the problem most productions face.
Compare Expanded Universe. See also Adaptation Distillation, Compressed Adaptation, Humble Beginnings, Patchwork Story, Not His Sled, Updated Re Release. An adaptation In Name Only goes even further than this, throwing out the original plot and making things up out of whole cloth."
t00270,AdaptationNameChange,"Alice Andrews in the books becomes Alice Allen in The Movie then Annie Adams in The Series.
This is when a character or group has a name change between adaptations.
The Name Change of The Character can be their first name, last name or both that also includes super alter egos.
The key to this trope is that between adaptations, the character must clearly be the same. If they are a Suspiciously Similar Substitute or a Composite Character, then this trope does not apply.
This can sometimes be an Enforced Trope. Production studios retain a team of lawyers whose job it is to ensure that every name in every work is shared either by many people or by no people in the area that the work is being produced, a process known as ""clearance"". This is to avoid a lawsuit: if there's exactly one person named Darkness von Gothick, you're just begging for him to sue you for portraying him as a villain. But names that are common in one place and time might be more rare in another, resulting in a name being cleared for use when The Movie was filmed in Hollywood fifty years ago but not when The Series is filmed in Vancouver today.
This is also very common in foreign adaptations, where names are changed to either reflect the local culture, or to give the show its own identity. It may also accompany a Race Lift, Adaptational Nationality change, or Gender Flip, with a character's name reflecting his or her new ethnicity or gender (usually).
This trope only applies when the adaptation is in the same language as the original. When a character's name changes in a translation, that's Dub Name Change. If a character didn't originally have any name then they're Named by the Adaptation. If it's Based on a True Story, see Roman à Clef."
t00328,AdultFear,"Adult Fears are about the things mature, well-adjusted adults generally are concerned about, as opposed to supernatural, petty, or far-fetched fears: the safety of their children, the safety of their neighborhood, the fidelity of their spouse, the loyalty of their friends and coworkers, the health of themselves and their family, being able to pay their bills, etc. To an adult (especially paranoid fathers), children being preyed upon by pedophiles or sociopaths can be scarier than children being preyed upon by a Xenomorph. To be scared about a fictional monster requires artistic application of the Rule of Scary and a Willing Suspension of Disbelief from the audience, but to be scared about the Death of a Child simply requires enough absence of childhood innocence to be aware of the reality that this (God forbid) can actually happen.
The audience reaction is still to be scared, but this trope plays down the shock factor of more fantastical horror and plays up the relative realism of more mundane threats.
Outliving your children in general might be the worst fear of this kind. Often overlaps with Primal Fear. It is also the reason why tropes such as Mama Bear, Papa Wolf and Overprotective Dad exist.
Can have political purposes as well as entertaining ones; expect to see them evoked all over the place in a Propaganda Piece. Defanged Horrors are the result of trying to target the youngest age group."
t00330,AdultsAreUseless,"In some shows that revolve around teenagers, preteens, or younger children, adults can't do anything right — if they appear on-screen at all. Teachers tend to be annoying sticks-in-the-mud who do nothing but spoil people's fun. Parents are clueless, no longer care, or are either over- or underprotective. And any other designated authority figures the kid might come across? Forget it.
Usually, this is just plot necessity (especially on comedy shows). After all, a High School Hustler could hardly get anything done if the teachers kept their eyes open, and if the parents were vigilant; being told that You Are Grounded would wreck the plot.
But on a handful of drama shows, there's a real venom to it. Radio Free Roscoe is about a group of heroic teens who defy a tyrannical school administration. On a smaller scale, Degrassi: The Next Generation has episodes where it is implied that stealing school property is no big deal, but it's disgraceful to inform on the thief.
This can also occur in shows where you Can't Get Away with Nuthin' — kids who break school rules somehow always get caught, but due to bad luck, not because a teacher was alert.
This is also common when adults are told something is happening, but simply don't believe it, resulting in a Cassandra Truth. The logical extreme of this trope is There Are No Adults.
This trope often gives the impression that only teens or younger kids are capable of saving the world and stuff. The problem with this is that it implies that there's no point in telling adults about your problems because they'd either disbelieve you or be too useless to help.
However, this trope can occasionally be used in a more mature fashion to demonstrate a moral about growing up and realizing that adults are not all-powerful. This is especially common in military or war-themed shows and literature, where the point is that adults are ultimately unable to protect the younger generation. This version is, unfortunately, often Truth in Television. Another interpretation of this is merely that the adults who can help won't because the dilemma's solution (at least the obvious and often more exciting one) would pretty much wind up breaking several laws and safety codes. This can be especially true in a lot of shows involving the police or military; the ones who strictly adhere to code are always shown incompetent whereas the ones who break code are the competent ones. It may be a good way to teach that you can't solve all your problems by just asking the grown-ups to help.
Another seldom-used aspect of this trope sort of plays off the above. In this version, it's not that Adults are useless; quite the opposite. The problem is that the protagonists — because of youthful embarrassment, a need to prove themselves or simple ego — can't ask for help, or accept it when it's given. The message here is that asking for help is a good thing (one can't do everything alone) and not bothering to trust people with more skill/experience ultimately causes more trouble than it's worth. This version is also Truth in Television, but you'll not find many young people who are willing to admit that.
Another more mature variant of the trope (and one that is also unfortunately Truth in Television) is that the adults are abusive and other adults around cover for the abuse or justify it and/or the abusers. While in many settings there's someone the child could eventually find for help, in some (small towns in The ’50s, before the internet, fundamentalist religious societies) there isn't or the children don't know/can't find the actually supportive adults and/or can't identify their treatment as abuse.
Sometimes it may even be a simple case of Poor Communication Kills - sometimes the adults seem worthless because they aren't seeing it from the characters' point of view. Or a combination of the above where the kids simply don't tell the adults so they don't know.
Parental Obliviousness and Police are Useless are subtropes. An Obstructive Bureaucrat may show up, but it's not something the younger age group encounters often.
See also: Teenage Wasteland, Competence Zone, Parent ex Machina, Best Years of Your Life, Lazy Husband, Babysitter from Hell. For an inversion, see Teens Are Monsters.
Not to be confused with Humans Are Morons, which deals with everybody being like this."
t00360,AerithAndBob,"In some fantasy settings, people have names that you would expect to see in real life. In others, names are made up to sound exotic.
And then you have the mixed approach: people named Zelor and Lithnara alongside people named James and Catherine. That's Aerith and Bob.
Don't expect the characters to acknowledge the distinction. Note that this doesn't count if the author is making a distinction e.g. as a Translation Convention for different cultures (cf. The Lord of the Rings, where the hobbits' and the nearby Men's Westron-language names are ""translated"" as more real-world ones, but no others are), or in a cosmopolitan setting where characters might be reasonably expected to have diverse cultural backgrounds without this necessarily being explicitly stated.
In stories set in The Future, new names can be assumed to have been invented or become popular over the years, while older names would still exist alongside them. Can also happen within an Overly Long Name, where a Muggle-type name is liable to appear amid a long series of archaic names. Most often, the ""normal"" name is ""Terry"", ""Scott"", ""Dave"", ""Steve"", ""Lyle"", or ""Kevin"", because those names are somehow inherently funny. Sometimes happens accidentally in a cast full of Aeriths if an author finds a name from another language that sounds exotic to them, since it will inevitably sound like a Bob to viewers from the culture it comes from.
The Trope Namer is a combination of Final Fantasy VII, which has the eponymous ""Aerith"" alongside names like ""Vincent"" and ""Barret"", and a play on Alice and Bob.
Not to be confused (or transliterated) with Alice and Bob. When it's played for laughs, it's an Odd Name Out. See also Special Person, Normal Name. Compare Melting-Pot Nomenclature, Sesquipedalian Smith and My Friends... and Zoidberg. One of the names may be a Real Joke Name — for extra laughs, it might be ""Bob"".
Truth in Television obviously, so Real Life examples have their own page. Proceed at your own risk."
t00369,AffablyEvil,"Usually, villains have a personality or manner that underscores how evil they are. They may kick puppies for giggles, be particularly insensitive and/or fanatically obsessed with their cause, or might just be too unknowable and/or eldritch to be anything but evil.
Then there are villains who are Affably Evil. There is absolutely nothing separating them from being normal, polite people except for the fact that they want to Take Over the World or use human souls to power their Artifact of Doom. They're not the Stepford Smiler or the Bitch in Sheep's Clothing— their affability is a genuine part of their personality, not a mask. And this is what ultimately differentiates them those tropes and Faux Affably Evil. If they have underlings, expect them to be a Benevolent Boss. In one way, they're the opposite of an Anti-Hero. They may Pet the Dog on occasion, but won't hesitate to kick it with steel-toed boots the next second if it helps them accomplish their Evil Plan. They may well be a Villain with Good Publicity because, after all, being evil doesn't mean you have to be anti-social.
If this trope gets exaggerated, this villain will invite the hero out to tea, offer them a favorite dish, talk friendly, try to appeal to the hero's better nature, and convince the heroes that the villain's plan isn't worth getting involved in or is even worth joining. Of course, if the hero still won't change their mind, the villain will remind them that they are, after all, still a villain. It may or may not involve a Death Trap, depending on how nice the villain really is when crossed. Of course, inviting the hero's mom out to tea might send a stronger message. The friendliness of said villains can serve to humanize these guys. In situations with Evil vs. Evil, they are often A Lighter Shade of Black in this conflict.
Usually a Wicked Cultured, charismatic Magnificent Bastard. They are sometimes comedic or a Well-Intentioned Extremist who really believes that they are right. More often than not, they are a form of Anti-Villain because a straight villain wouldn't easily be so genuinely good-natured. Evil Has a Bad Sense of Humor is not true for them, and their affability even makes them easy to ""compliment"" with an Insult Backfire. Captives of an affably evil villain won't be kept in dungeons, but in a Gilded Cage. Even an outright psychopath can come off as this if charismatic and funny enough. In fact legitimately insane characters can at times balance this with Faux Affably Evil more easily than sane ones, since the contrast is explained by their mental instability.
In the event an Affably Evil villain does undergo a Villainous Breakdown, the very traits that make them so pleasant often serve to make their breakdown extremely creepy or outright scary. A kind, friendly man suddenly going into a psychotic rage is made all the more scary by the simple fact that he was previously so nice and kind. If they keep their inviting personality while going Ax-Crazy, they may cross into Faux Affably Evil territory with only skin-deep manners, which is a much more frequent behaviour than a truly kind criminal.
Compare:
Contrast:
Good Is Not Nice is the Inverted Trope, and such good guys are particularly good at giving the Affably Evil a proverbial punch in the nose. When both Good Is Not Nice and Affably Evil are used, you may end up with Polite Villains, Rude Heroes. I'm Not Hungry is often dealing with this villain. A villain will sometimes engage in Too Funny to Be Evil to achieve this effect. No, Mr. Bond, I Expect You to Dine is a subtrope in many instances."
t00374,AffectionateNickname,"Quite simply, when a character gives another character a cute or endearing nickname because the two are either as close as True Companions, or the namer is interested romantically in the name. The nickname may not be well-received by the one being named, as they find it insulting or embarrassing, but in the mind of the name-giver it's sweet and/or thoughtful. The formal term for an affectionate nickname is a ""hypocorism"".
In short, it's a pet name. Expect The Nicknamer to dole these out a lot.
Sub-Trope of In-Series Nickname. Compare Insult of Endearment. Contrast Terms of Endangerment, where an enemy uses a superficially affectionate nickname in an irritating or disturbing manner."
t00405,AfterTheEnd,"Something hugely nasty has happened to humanity. Be it nuclear war (which was once very popular but has gone out of vogue, in part due to The Great Politics Mess-Up), The Plague (which currently seems to be the most popular), natural disaster (which seems the most likely to happen in the near future in Real Life), supernatural disaster (usually the case with a Sealed Evil in a Can or missing Cosmic Keystone), devastating environmental changes (which, in this kind of fiction, happen too quickly for civilisation to adapt), a Zombie Apocalypse (also hugely popular these days), or an Alien Invasion (God help us if that one happens) - most of humanity is gone.
The result is generally that you have the remnants of humanity fighting to survive in a hellish and devastated Crapsack World full of Scenery Gorn, Ghost Cities and a lot of nastiness in every corner of whatever remained of past civilization. This environment is perhaps also a Scavenger World which may have pieces of Schizo Tech and Lost Technology (or even Weird Science) here and there, but also where people inevitably degrade down to Disaster Scavengers and Crazy Survivalists, for whom staying alive may well mean being Reduced to Ratburgers or worse, especially if they're Too Desperate to Be Picky. If enough time has passed, those born after the end may hear stories of The Beforetimes from those few who survived the catastrophe, trying to impress upon the children what humanity was and still is capable of. Expect a Fish out of Temporal Water who Slept Through the Apocalypse to wake up to see their world changed. At any point in the setting an Apocalyptic Log may be found to explain exactly why the world was devastated in the first place, and/or an Archaeological Arms Race might break out to reclaim the old world's technology.
Large civilizations that were able to recover or at least preserved can include a Divided States of America and multiple interwarring states fighting each other for the corpses of a former superpower, a Dystopia struggling to survive, or a Days of Future Past with a Future Imperfect attempt to recreate happier times.
In any post-apocalyptic story created after the release of Mad Max, it is almost assured that the obvious and natural way for the world to look after a civilisation-destroying cataclysm is ""the Australian Outback"". There is no need to explain this. Global catastrophe turns the world into a gangster-infested anarchist Wretched Hive Australia. It just follows logically. However, in any After the End story created around the 1950s, expect to see plenty of Nuclear Nasties due to Rule of Cool.
Related, if not quite the same, is the period immediately after the fall of Rome; most Film and TV set in this time tend to depict it as a time of post-apocalyptic anarchist savagery populated by interwarring warlords. Thus, After the End stories will reference historical parallels about humanity's decay into Medieval Morons wallowing in filth and superstition, fighting for survival, and exterminating any ""mutants"" with fire. In fact, while there was a significant increase in banditry and piracy, most areas were peaceful most of the time. Fantasy series (especially JRPGs) are chock full of ancient, highly advanced civilizations that met their end and pitted humanity into a long Dark Age in a similar manner.
If you're really lucky, you may get a Cosy Catastrophe, in which case it's best to be friendly and humane, but also adaptable and brave. Of course, that's not a bad personality in Real Life. If you're really unlucky, the only ones left to mourn at Humanity's Wake will be robots, mutants and aliens. Or dogs — you just better hope you brought yours along for the ride, and it stays faithful...
While this is a legitimate trope, like Luke, I Am Your Father, it's also a very popular fan theory for shows that don't seem to take place in our world.
Compare Just Before the End, End of an Age, And Man Grew Proud. Not to be confused with The Stinger, an after the end credits scene. See also Soiled City on a Hill and Depopulation Bomb."
t00434,AGodAmI,"When a villain, often the Big Bad, gains superhuman abilities or achieves their dearest dream, one can expect them to gain delusions of godhood.
They will often give an over-the-top speech emphasizing just how far beyond ordinary humanity they have evolved, and how lowly they are compared with him. Cue the villain becoming a megalomaniacal Narcissist who is Drunk on the Dark Side and/or declaring that they will Take Over the World.
But you know what they say... Pride cometh before the fall. If they're declaring themselves as a god right in front of a real God, then they’re definitely screwed.
The character may declare that they have transcended morality as well, and is Above Good and Evil, but the tropes do not have to coincide.
Aiming for godhood by rewriting the rules of the world is In Their Own Image. Another alternate version is the ""End of the World"" Special. See Physical God for those who don't have to try so hard. May, but does not always result in a God-Mode Sue. Also, see It's All About Me for a similar trope, minus the declaration of godhood.
Ancient sovereigns liked this trope; see also God-Emperor for those examples. See also One-Winged Angel, Smug Super, and Dark Messiah. Very common with the Satanic Archetype. Also see Like a God to Me, which is when a character declares someone else godlike but only out of flattery, not as a statement of serious worship. Not to be confused with God Guise, where a character merely pretends to be a god as part of a con. A Straw Nihilist may also have megalomaniacal delusions and believe themselves to be immortal, but never claims to be a god and in fact insists that gods don't exist.
In fiction these characters tend to be atheists ""playing god"" while the heros will be spiritual and ""stay in their place"" relative to God, likely as a jab on nonbelievers. This trend is often considered offensive to atheists. Not to mention in Real Life people that display this trope are usually religious, which makes sense when you think about it. How can one consider themselves to be God if they don't think gods are real?
Contrast with A God I Am Not, where a genuinely godlike being refuses the label to avoid the implications; Stop Worshipping Me, where a deity doesn't want to be venerated as such; Pro-Human Transhuman, where a post human remains sympathetic to humanity; A God Is You, where you are cast as a god, or your Player Character is a god; and Unwanted False Faith, where a human (or transhuman, or other sapient) who is worshiped as a god would rather not be.
Note that this trope requires a self-proclamation of godhood, not just sheer cockiness and/or overconfidence.note The actual words ""I am a god"" are an easy indicator, but not absolutely necessary. Speaking of oneself in more subtly deific terms is quite sufficient. Possessing or gaining godlike powers by itself doesn’t count, nor is it a requirement to possess such powers to qualify for this trope. Usually being a Physical God and declaring oneself to be a God isn't this trope unless the physical gods in the setting are not omnipotent while this particular one believes it is omnipotent.
The technical term for this is suitheism (when one believes they are a god, but admits others exist) or autotheism (when they believe they are divine and worship themselves)."
t00499,AlienAmongUs,"A being from outer space generally comes to Earth either to observe and learn about us or to help guide us (or just get stuck here) and must keep his true nature a secret. A good opportunity for Mr. Exposition to make his presence felt as the alien often needs everything explained, or describes the situation for others of his kind who might share his curiosity. A lot of comedy can be drawn from the newly landed alien having No Social Skills.
Alternatively, the alien or aliens could be stranded and unable to leave. If they want to return home, they'll never get to, making Earth their Gilligan's Island. Often, the alien will eventually lose interest in leaving, and if given the opportunity will refuse it. This is usually the case when they form strong attachments and relationships to Earthlings, such as becoming friends with a human roommate.
Tends to grow less and less plausible the longer a series lasts, as evidenced by the difficulty many viewers had with the idea that the 3rd Rock from the Sun aliens would not know about taxes after four years in the United States.
If the main character is from our world (or one close to it) and the setting is another, that's Trapped in Another World. A whole community of Aliens Among Us, living here for a while, will probably form a Wainscot Society.
Compare First Contact. See also Amusing Alien, Humanity Ensues, Raised by Wolves, Fish out of Water, Mysterious Waif."
t00510,AlienKudzu,"One of the possible side effects of an Alien Invasion.
In essence, Alien Kudzu is a plant-like, fungus-like, or otherwise predominantly sessile alien lifeform that infests a planet's environment and begins reproducing itself rapidly. It is almost always harmful to the local habitat, whether directly (such as giving off toxic gases) or simply by outcompeting and choking out the local vegetation. It is also usually very difficult to kill, making the act of reclaiming these infestations take up great deals of time and resources (if not outright impossible).
The aliens may release it deliberately as part of their invasion in order to Terraform the Earth into a planet more suited to their own environment, or it may be just the result of the alien plants naturally being able to outproduce the local competition.
Alien Kudzu can sometimes be used for a Meat Moss effect as a sort of visual shorthand to show that things are really, really bad.
Note that neither the plant nor the invaders need to actually come from another planet; ""alien"" in its original sense simply refers to something foreign and/or not native. (Indeed, in Real Life this is common enough that we have a word for it — invasive species — and the kudzu plant is one of the most notorious examples, as any Southerner can rightly attest.) They usually are, though, especially in Science Fiction settings.
Compare Explosive Breeder, which is a similar concept applied to animals, and Botanical Abomination. Named after the same plant as Kudzu Plot, but the two tropes are unrelated. It's also not to be confused with the Newspaper Comic of the same name."
t00522,AliensNeverInventedTheWheel,"Humans Are Special. Aliens are too, but it's more difficult to pass off an alien culture or that of an Alternate Universe Earth as fundamentally different from humanity by introducing a unique set of Technology Levels and social traits than to just have them lack something humans have. Wouldn't it feel alien to be asked what a table does or what the strange noise patterns that emerge from your iPod are?
Some aliens' hat is not knowing what a hat is. Despite being Rubber-Forehead Aliens, Human Aliens from a very Earth-like planet on the same Technology Level with abundant Inexplicable Cultural Ties, or even Alternate Universe versions of actual humans, they are different from humans as we know them today in that they have failed to develop one very specific cultural practice.
This trope can be used to pull Aesops in demonstrating how humanity wouldn't be human without love, music, sports etc. or, on the other hand, how humanity could do well without war, money, soap operas or what have you. In keeping with that, there are two ways of playing this trope: either the aliens are stumped by an Earth invention or the humans are surprised to find out that the the aliens don't have it. Sometimes the author might just be complaining about stuff he doesn't like or finds frivolous by showing Humans Through Alien Eyes. Other times, it's just a throw-away gag. And finally, just to be clear, this trope doesn't automatically make the aliens weak.
The lack of human emotions, specially this thing called love, may be used to define the alien race as well. If the aliens devote their culture to knowledge, they will be a race of Straw Vulcans. If they choose warfare instead, they will be a Proud Warrior Race or even Always Chaotic Evil; and likely the villains.
You can get the same vibe from this trope as from In Spite of a Nail, but it deals with parallel planets rather than parallel universes. Contrast Schizo Tech and Insufficiently Advanced Alien.
Some members of the audience find it breaks their Willing Suspension of Disbelief, while others feel that discovering a fundamental if specific difference in an otherwise less than exotic alien culture makes it more believable.
Might be the reason some Aliens Steal Cable and Alien Arts Are Appreciated. May also be the reason that there is No Such Thing as Alien Pop Culture and why Automobiles Are Alien. Contrast with the political version: Aliens Never Invented Democracy."
t00593,AlliterativeName,"In Real Life an alliterative name is a name in which the first and last names begin with the same letter. In more extreme cases, this can also include the middle name.
Giving a character an alliterative name is one of many ways a writer can make a name more interesting and catchy, which in turn makes the character more memorable to the audience. This is especially important in works with Loads and Loads of Characters, where extra help is needed to differentiate between them.
In comic books, this is especially true of the names of Super Heroes or their close hangers-on. It was a favorite tool of Stan Lee's, since, swarmed with projects, he often had trouble remembering the characters' names, and the alliteration worked as a mnemonic device. (Though it didn't always work perfectly — Lee occasionally referred to ""Peter Palmer"" and ""Bob Banner"".)
Of note to writers: Overusing this trope dilutes its effect, particularly if multiple characters have the same starting letters in their names.
In comic books, the Alliterative Name is often also Two First Names. In cartoons, it goes hand-in-hand with Species Surname.
See Alliterative Title, for work titles that do this.
Please note that Japanese names, though many may seem alliterative to an English-speaking audience, may not convey the same ""alliterative power"" in their original setting; syllables (and vowel sounds) matter more than letters in Japanese.
While Truth in Television, this is way too common, so no Real Life examples."
t00608,AllMythsAreTrue,"In fantasy, all myths, legends, and folk tales are either accurate descriptions of past events or accurate predictions of the future.
If the hero's got to do something Because Destiny Says So, these are the official mandates that forces them to do it. Saying ""It's just a myth"" usually marks a jaded skeptic that has lost all faith in the world or a Muggle knee-deep in what's going to hit the fan.
If a character tells the hero a story and then adds: ""but it's probably just an old fairy-tale"" — you can bet anything it's completely true and very soon, the hero will see firsthand whatever the story was about.
And Man Grew Proud, Domino Revelation, and Prophecies Are Always Right are SubTropes of this. For versions where the myth is based on truth but people got the details wrong, see God Guise, Cargo Cult, Ancient Astronauts, Physical God, Sufficiently Advanced Alien, and A God Am I. If this treatment is given to only one pantheon/religion/what-have-you, see A Mythology Is True. For characters who might live in a world where All Myths Are True and despite solid evidence don't believe it, see Flat-Earth Atheist.
For the scientific counterpart, see All Theories Are True. For the conspiracy nut, there's the Conspiracy Kitchen Sink. For the video game rumor counterpart, see Infallible Babble. Someone with the tendency to exclaim ""That can't exist!"" in one of these settings may suffer from Arbitrary Skepticism.
A not uncommon variant of this is to have only ancient myths be explicitly true and shown on screen, with the truth of modern religions going unexamined or remaining ambiguous; this is done for reasons similar to No Such Thing as Wizard Jesus, where writers avoid touching on religions with significant numbers of modern adherents in order to avoid the controversy that would come from putting them on equal footing with myths few modern readers treat seriously.
This goes hand in hand with the Law of Conservation of Detail: if a myth is mentioned in a show, it should be relevant to the plot, and the myth being true will certainly help with that. See also The Legend of Chekhov.
Not to be confused with Clap Your Hands If You Believe (and its sub-trope Gods Need Prayer Badly), where believing in a myth makes it true. One Myth to Explain Them All is if they all stem from the same source (aliens, wizards, etc). If literally all myths, not just the ones relevant to the plot, are true in a certain setting, that's a Crossover Cosmology or a Fantasy Kitchen Sink."
t00632,AllThereInTheManual,"Information not mentioned within a specific work, but only found in supplemental material or in other works within the franchise. The significance of the info varies; it can be anything from little backstory details that clarify minor points, to information that is critical to understanding the plot.
For example, many anime OVAs based on a manga begin In Medias Res and rarely explain themselves under the assumption an OVA (being an occasional test run for a series) will typically be watched by someone who has read the original manga.
Other information can be found in text novels, video games, radio dramas, and image songs, as the entire franchise is treated as a package. Though, if you don't have the money for all that, there's always TV Tropes and That Other Wiki.
Fairly common in anime and mostly unknown in American shows, although it seems to be steadily picking up speed with shows like Lost. However, it's very common in American comic books because of the assurance that the stereotypical fan is obsessive enough to collect supplemental material (see Ultimate Universe). This also applies to the elaborate backstories many video games of the 1980s provided in accompanying comic books or novellas.
A common response to people who complain about The Film of the Book not making sense is that they should have read the book. Naturally there is disagreement on whether this is fair; some believe that a movie should stand on its own, while others feel that those who care enough to complain should care enough to read.
Related tropes include:
So named for video games up until the late 90s, which had less ability and budget to actually tell a story in most genres. To compensate, information like backstories and character profiles were often included in the manual, although whether this was written by those who wrote the game was a crapshoot (not to mention being different between regions, like in the older Sonic the Hedgehog games). Not to be confused with Read the Freaking Manual, which refers to the oversight of not reading the manual despite it containing important practical information."
t00677,AlphaBitch,"If she doesn't like you, no one likes you.
Take your typical setting involving teenagers—say, a High School—wait an establishing scene or two or three, and there she is. See that attractive blonde cheerleader looking down her nose (often literally) and sneering at the frumpy girl in glasses? That's her. Often times, she is the authority of the cheerleading squad and decides who's on and off the squad. After all, who needs a coach?
The villainess of many a Teen Drama, the Alpha Bitch is the Distaff Counterpart to the Jerk Jock, and usually his girlfriend;note  sometimes he's also her attack dog what he does with his fists, she does with a sharp tongue and sharper manipulation. She is often surrounded by a fawning Girl Posse who suck up to her and act as her faithful minions. She's very likely to be a Narcissist, a Drama Queen, a fashionista, a Valley Girl, a Bratty Teenage Daughter, a Daddy's Girl, an Attention Whore, and/or a Proud Beauty.
She's also usually the scion of a wealthy and influential family, the star of the school or head sister of the influential college sorority house, thus providing her a network of local celebrity, influence and wealth to exploit. She's also quite the seductress, and consequently, all the boys fight amongst themselves—sometimes literally—to be her oppressed boyfriend. And to top it off, she's also very good-looking. All this leaves her with the belief that she can do whatever she likes without consequences. Unfortunately, she's often right; the Powers That Be are not immune to her family's wealth, connections, and influence, and they can and will be corrupted or coerced into overlooking her bad behavior.
Her natural enemy is the Cool Loser heroine. Whenever their eternal, jealousy-fueled struggle over possessions, boyfriends, and status is sparked anew, quarter will neither be asked for nor given.
Usually the Veronica in a Betty and Veronica situation, if she's even presented as a love interest at all. Frequently on the Snob end of Slobs vs. Snobs. It's a Costume Party, I Swear!, the Prank Date, and the Party Scheduling Gambit are just some of the many nasty tricks she plays. Often receives her comeuppance at the hands of a member of her own Girl Posse in a Backstabbing the Alpha Bitch moment, or when the Cool Loser fights back (sometimes with an Engineered Public Confession). Normally joined by a Beta Bitch who assists her in her various cruel deeds.
If given some Character Development, she will become a Defrosting Ice Queen and grow into a Spoiled Sweet, or a Lovable Alpha Bitch. This might come from a reveal that she's actually hiding the fact that she's very easily-embarrassed. This trope is probably so common because everyone who wasn't homeschooled knew someone like this... or was one. It self-perpetuates because girls who want to be popular will copy what works on TV. They might even become the mask.
Most examples fall into one of two types:
If she's not the cheerleader type with the fake smile, but is the (usually) unglamorous girl who will fight to be the best in her class, she's the Academic Alpha Bitch. Though almost always a she, rare male Alpha Bitches (called Alpha Bastards) do exist, but they're just that — rare. They're distinct from the Jerk Jock in that they're mainly catty and manipulative, rather than physically threatening.
Not to be confused with the Prison Alpha Bitch, found exclusively in women's jail, whose methods of bullying are much more brutal and whose goal isn't social status but outright dominance.
The reason this character type is hated more than other Jerkass characters may have to do with her privilege and looks, see also Jerk Sue. Contrast Unpopular Popular Character.

And yes, alpha bitches do exist in real life. No further elaboration is necessary."
t00732,AlwaysChaoticEvil,"A common concept of the sci-fi and fantasy genres (and especially games of those genres) is the notion of not an organization, not a clan, not a city, but an entire race of bad guys who brag about how Evil they are.
Though the Trope Namer is Dungeons  Dragons, this trope is actually Older Than Dirt — one would be hard pressed to find any myths or folk tales that don't have some creatures that are portrayed as always evil.
Note that the race can also be Lawful Evil or Neutral Evil. In fact, 99% of the time, it will be a race that simply is evil to the core, with some individual differences in their stances on Order Versus Chaos. The orcs in The Lord of the Rings are a perfect example: they are arguably a Lawful Evil race overall, even if individual members are not. Just because there's an army of Lawful Good humans, doesn't mean that the evil army that opposes them can't also be lawful. It must be said that merely showing an evil, conquering army is not enough to prove this trope, so long as a doubt that everyone of the same nationality or race approves remains. They are part of the same group after all, of course they would share the same beliefs. Nor does showing a few evil members of a species proves that this species qualifies. It must be beyond the shadow of a doubt, that this holds true for every single individual, and in the well-done cases even justified. Also a variation playing with this trope is of creatures having basically the same background, but some choosing evil and transforming into something different.
How, exactly, these folk have unanimously embraced one ethos (especially one so detrimental to the survival of the group), when humans have been known to kill each other over the kind of hip-hop they prefer, is often unknown and inconsequential. When the ethos is justified, often the race is explicitly artificial in origin, rather than natural. Their nature is determined by the evil individual who created them as slaves/warriors/etc. — thus dodging the problem that Children Are Innocent. This is often reinforced by having their society believe in Asskicking Equals Authority... and in this case, anyone weak (good) will be killed very quickly.
One must consider that morality exists due to the fact that humans are social animals. Parents care for their offspring so they can grow up strong and so they can teach them lessons that they would otherwise have to work out for themselves. A tribe of hunter/gatherers pools the food it gathers and splits it so those that don't get much one day due to bad luck will be in good condition to get some tomorrow. Farmers raise crops and feed a blacksmith who forges tools so said farmers can better till the land. Society is built on said interactions, but all of which is predicated on interactions going smoothly and being unlikely to end in one side murdering the other for momentary gain or a laugh. In that case the rational thing to do is to avoid others of your kind like a plague.
Expect the national dress to be Spikes of Villainy and black leather, the reason for keeping pets to be kicking, and their language to be the Black Speech.
The Defector from Decadence typically comes from this stock, usually with some qualifier, or after having become an Ascended Demon. Having an ancestor from such a race usually qualifies a character's evil (or potential for it) as being ""In the Blood"".
It's quite common for a fantasy Big Bad to have an Always Chaotic Evil race at the ready to use as mooks (possibly even engineered by them). It's usually justified as an arrangement among the various Powers That Be. The heroes are likely to be from races where good and evil are possible, to contrast their differences.
When a fictional character (whether human or a member of another fictional race) wrongly and unreasonably believes that a fictional race in their world is this trope, it's a case of Fantastic Racism. A member of a fictional race holding the same unjustified and false belief about humans would likewise be Fantastic Racism.
May be the subject of a Genocide Dilemma, sometimes going so far that a Final Solution against the defined-as-evil race is portrayed in a quite cheerful light. This is Planet of Hats when evil is the hat. For evil professions like pirates and hitmen, see Villain by Default. For cases where humanity, aliens, or predators really are this trope, see Humans Are the Real Monsters, Aliens are Bastards and Predators Are Mean respectively. For tropes that include cases where animals are Always Chaotic Evil, see Cats Are Mean, Wicked Weasel, You Dirty Rat!, and Reptiles Are Abhorrent.
Be careful when writing these: may lead to Unfortunate Implications.
See also What Measure Is a Non-Human?, Hard-Coded Hostility, My Species Doth Protest Too Much, Dehumanization, and Scary Dogmatic Aliens. If the trope's subjects are a distinct species as opposed to an ethnicity, their reasons for being this may be Blue and Orange Morality. Compare Lawful Stupid, Chaotic Stupid. Contrast Always Lawful Good. Should not be confused with Chaotic Evil.
For subversions of this trope, when it turns out that an enemy race is not necessarily bad, see Not Always Evil and Token Heroic Orc."
t00773,AmbiguousDisorder,"This character's behaviour is bizarrely outside the norm — it's way beyond mere ordinary quirkiness. No reasons are given for the strange behaviour. No specific diagnosis is ever mentioned in the story. In fact, any resemblance to any real disorder is likely accidental; the character's symptoms are exactly those symptoms the writer wants them to have. It is a case of Ambiguous Disorder.
The disordered behaviour will often be Played for Laughs. This technique is generally used to avoid writing yet another Patient of the Week story about some specific disorder and to focus on the laugh-producing elements without having to deal with the serious issues. Or, less generously, to mock the kooky outer aspects of mental illness without the risk of getting angry letters.
In the instances where this trope is played seriously, the character usually overlaps with The Spock, Pinocchio Syndrome, or Tin Man and focus on this character's struggle to befriend people or otherwise fit into society.
A lot of mentally ill people in classical literature, especially from the 19th century and earlier, tend to be this; psychiatry was a very young field back then (and, until a certain point in history, didn't exist at all), and so there was no manual to turn to if you wanted to give your character odd quirks. Also, the lack of psychiatric expertise during these periods means that many historical figures might have had undiagnosed conditions (vast Wild Mass Guessing exists about this topic). Even today, due to difficulties in pinpointing an exact diagnosis, this is also often Truth in Television. That said, No Real Life Examples, Please! We don't want to start any sessions of ""armchair diagnosis,"" since that kind of speculation about real people inevitably leads to controversy. Also please note that in Real Life, most mental health diagnoses require that the behaviors the diagnosis purport to explain contribute significantly to impacted functioning in one or more domains of daily living. Plenty of people behave oddly from time to time without meeting the criteria for any major mental health diagnosis, and Occam's Razor applies to the diagnostic process. Personality quirks and variations are perfectly normal, even if they may seem very strange or downright unrelatable to outsiders. Basically, as a rule of thumb: If your behavior doesn't significantly and negatively impact your quality of life, well-being and desired relationship with others, you don't have a mental disorder. Additionally, if the observed behaviors are best accounted for by an explanation that does not invoke a major mental health disorder, clinicians generally don't invoke a major mental health disorder.
Compare The Disease That Shall Not Be Named, Soap Opera Disease, Victorian Novel Disease, and G-Rated Mental Illness.
For when a character is explicitly confirmed (either in-story or by Word of God) to have a specific disorder but their portrayal isn't necessarily accurate, please check Hollywood Autism, Hollywood Tourette's, Super OCD, ""L"" Is for ""Dyslexia"", Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!, Funny Schizophrenia, and The Schizophrenia Conspiracy."
t00792,AmbitionIsEvil,"There's a character who aims to improve their situation in life, be it in terms of money, fame, or power. There is a high probability of this character starting out as evil or becoming evil very quickly. The Visionary Villain and Well-Intentioned Extremist will do horrible things to achieve their Heaven on Earth; The Social Darwinist and The Sociopath will commit every act of crime and manipulation to move up the ranks; the Corrupt Corporate Executive began as a dirt-poor proletarian who wanted to live wealthy, etc. Upon attaining this power, they'll likely forget whatever it was they wanted it for in the first place. The Illusion of Pride, and the inevitable tale of Tragedy for the one who dared to be ambitious is likely.
Fictional and Real Life moral codes have a tendency to demonstrate Selfishness, Greed, Pride, Megalomania, and Machiavellian Chronic Backstabbing Disorder as a consequence of the catch-all term ""ambition"". If you consult a dictionary it's broader than that. Ambition is the same thing that motivates some heroes to make the world a better place, but in that case it's more likely to be called ""Hope"".
This trope is one of the reasons why Villains Act, Heroes React. Villains who don't have great ambitions would not plot grand schemes and motivate story driving conflicts such as Take Over the World or Utopia Justifies the Means, and, therefore, would be boring and petty. It is possible to write an ""ambitionless"" villain — see For the Evulz — but they risk coming off as a Generic Doomsday Villain.
Justified when the existing society is an evil dystopia, or otherwise flawed — ""advancing"" in such a society would mean complying with or encouraging its systemic injustices. Also justified when ambition, or other emotions, is the personification of evil itself.
Can happen as a result of Status Quo Is God. Normally used as an Anvilicious Aesop about what's really important. Unfortunately ends up in a Broken Aesop that teaches us Evil Is Cool (or at least open to social progress).
The Svengali, since their goal is usually to profit through their (supposed) protege, will usually be an example of this, and turn their protege into one, unless they realize in time.
This is a common trait of The Starscream; indeed, it's often what makes them The Starscream.
The heroic converse of this trope is To Be a Master, where the hero is motivated by ambition. Note that heroes tend to pursue ""healthy"" goals such as strength and knowledge, while villains are more likely to be after power or money, usually for their own benefit and no one else's and at other people's expense.
For some reason, while even high levels of ambition are bad, equal or greater levels of determination are usually presented as good, or at least not bad. If you have high levels of both, you're The Unfettered. Heaven help the character intending to use their super powers this way; it guarantees Screw the Rules, I Have Supernatural Powers!. If a character wants to rise above the level of their fellows, it might be a case of The Complainer Is Always Wrong.
This, in a way, is the inverse of Living Is More Than Surviving, where achieving more than the most basic things people can do is seen as good.
See also Pride, Personal Gain Hurts and Evil Virtues. Contrast with Self-Made Man, who pursues his ambitions, and isn't (necessarily) evil, as well any Rags to Riches story where The Protagonist means to become rich."
t00885,AndIMustScream,"A character suffers from an extremely horrifying Fate Worse than Death. Suicide is not an option; even death never comes to free them from it. They are immobilized or otherwise contained, unable to communicate with anyone, and unlikely to be removed from this situation — not even by death — anytime in the foreseeable future.
This is often a variation of Taken for Granite in which the victim remains conscious, and the worst-case scenario for tropes such as Sealed Room in the Middle of Nowhere, Baleful Polymorph, Phantom Zone Picture, and Who Wants to Live Forever?.
Usually, when this arises, it is eternal unless he's freed by outside forces, but a ""mere"" years-long or centuries-long fate is possible. For instance, a robot with a 100-year battery life getting buried underground. In fact, this is a very common sci-fi trope involving artificial intelligences who are potentially immortal due to being made of software. Unfortunately, if a victim is rescued, he may well have been driven insane from the experience. (Some of the listed examples show exactly that.)
Sometimes appears as a Backstory, if a Sealed Person In A Can was aware while sealed away. Can overlap with Go Mad from the Isolation if the character's separated from other people rather than among them but unable to interact. Also a handy way to punish the villain with a horrible fate, while still leaving a door open for them to return someday."
t00974,AnimalsHateHim,"How a character treats, reacts to, and is reacted to by animals delivers a wealth of information to a viewer. The virginal Princess Classic can summon woodland friends with song, the Jerk with a Heart of Gold will (despite hating animals) get Licked by the Dog, while the man in the Black Cloak with a Red Right Hand causes everything around him to wither and die, and the Evil-Detecting Dog just won't stop barking at him!
Then there's people who, regardless of their morality or niceness, simply have Animals Hate Him. Always, without fail. Offering a dove crumbs gets them dive bombed and crapped on. Petting a cat will result in getting inch deep claws dug into their leg, if not getting outright bit; and don't even ask what happens when this character is stupid enough to visit the woods or a zoo.
The reason for this animalistic antagonism varies. Maybe they just smell wrong, or 'good'. Perhaps they try too hard, or just have terrible skills at reading an animal's mood. Maybe they're just a Butt-Monkey or Chew Toy. Maybe they were especially cruel to animals in a past life. Sometimes there's no explanation; animals just don't like them. Characters who consider themselves ""in tune with nature"" a la the Nature Hero or Granola Girl, or ""so pure and innocent"" that they should receive friendly animal treatment are the likeliest to be treated this way, often to highlight just how out of touch they really are.
That is, this is an animal combination of Everything Trying to Kill You and 0% Approval Rating. Compare Scare the Dog, where animals react with terror, not hate, although there is some overlap.
And no, they don’t hate him because he learned one weird trick or anything like that."
t01024,AnnoyingYoungerSibling,"The Annoying Younger Sibling is often used by writers as a balance to the ""coolness"" of the main protagonist. Typically the opposite sex of the main character.
Little brothers tend to be: dirty and/or messy, good at sports, noisy, foul-mouthed, always get in trouble with authority, perverted, and just about always grabby when they see something their older sibling has that they don't, who will probably shriek ""gimme gimme"" and break it if they get their mitts on said object. Usually a Bratty Half-Pint, or in royalty, he's very likely to be The Evil Prince.
Younger sisters are usually: whiny, prone to cry (especially in order to get what they want), too curious, go headlong into real danger, ALWAYS have tea parties with dolls and one ""real"" participant, cheeky, nosy. Likely to be a Bratty Teenage Daughter if older than the standard.
Alternatively, it may be that the younger sibling in question has none of the above attributes, but incurs the wrath of the main characters in equal measure by being cleverer than they are, or by getting a disproportionate amount of (inevitably positive) attention.
Annoying younger siblings of both genders tend to be tag-alongs, especially when they're not wanted. Typically, there will be something of an age gap between the protagonist and the annoying younger sibling, about four to seven years in general. Too much of a gap and the sibling will lack the resources to be annoying enough. Too close and you're into Sibling Rivalry territory instead. Taken to the extreme by crossing Moral Event Horizon and you will see a Cain and Abel scene, or in worst, a case of Sibling Murder.
If the Annoying Younger Sibling is a late-introduced character to complicate the already-established siblings' relationships, then you have Cain and Abel and Seth.
Note that this trope is for younger siblings who are annoying to the other characters, not to the audience.
Truth in Television, obviously."
t01080,AntiHero,"An Archetypal Character who is almost as common in modern fiction as the Ideal Hero, an antihero is a protagonist who has the opposite of most of the traditional attributes of a hero. They may be bewildered, ineffectual, deluded, or merely apathetic. More often an antihero is just an amoral misfit. While heroes are typically conventional, anti-heroes, depending on the circumstances, may be preconventional (in a ""good"" society), postconventional (if the government is ""evil"") or even unconventional. Not to be confused with the Villain or the Big Bad, who is the opponent of Heroes (and Anti-Heroes, for that matter).
Most are to the cynical end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism.
There are just as many variations on Anti-Heroes as there are normal heroes. Some common attributes are: rarely speaking, being a loner, either extreme celibacy or extreme promiscuity, parental issues, occasional Bad Dreams and flashbacks relating to a Dark and Troubled Past that can take many forms depending on the Anti-Hero in question; and being able to tell the story of their life through any Nick Cave song. Some won't Save the Villain, but they will Shoot the Dog, and they will not hesitate to kill anyone who threatens them.
Other characters may try to impress upon them the value of more traditional heroic values through The Power of Friendship, but these lessons tend to bounce more often than stick.
What amoral antiheroes learn, if they learn anything at all over the course of the story, is that an existence devoid of absolute values offers a lot of isolation. Which may be to their liking. Don't You Dare Pity Me! is common, and gratitude may be repulsed with Think Nothing of It (just to get them to leave them alone).
These often crop up in deconstructions of traditionally heroic genres. As the struggling, imperfect protagonist begins to gain more respect and sympathy than the impressive-but-impossible-to-relate-to invincible superhero, ""anti"" heroes have come to be admired as a perfectly valid type of hero in their own right.
Sometimes, they're not the ""star"" (protagonist), but serve as The Rival or Worthy Opponent of the protagonist and are prone to becoming a Ensemble Dark Horse as fans enjoy their interactions with the protagonist. If they are part of a Five-Man Band, they will most certainly be The Lancer. Well liked ones may become a Deuteragonist or at least get A Day in the Limelight to please the fans.
The term is used more loosely today than it used to be, at least on This Wiki. In one definition of the word, the appeal of an antihero is that they're often very literally a hero: Namely; they do heroic deeds. But whereas Superman, Wonder Woman, and many other conventional heroes have both the physical and moral capabilities to do it, an antihero almost never has both.
Anti-Heroes are spread all over the alignment chart, tending toward Neutral types.
Traditionally, in literary analysis, the meaning of antihero was effectively the opposite of the now common usage, lacking the elements that make a hero ""cool"" rather than the elements that make them ""good"". Willy Loman and Shinji Ikari are archetypes of this form.
If you've been sent here by a work referring to someone as a ""Type-I"" antihero (or so forth), they are referring to Analysis.Anti Hero, which is a sub-page of this one. Since those numbers are no longer used even on that page, they should be replaced with an appropriate named type.
Compare Anti-Villain. A character who is a Wild Card or a Heel–Face Revolving Door can be capable of being both an Anti-Hero and an Anti-Villain depending on whether or not they are acting for or against the protagonist at the time. For an ensemble of these heroes, see Anti-Hero Team.
Not to be confused with the webcomic Anti-Heroes."
t01109,AntiVillain,"An Anti-Villain is the opposite of an Anti-Hero — a character with heroic goals, personality traits, and/or virtues who is ultimately the villain. Their desired ends are mostly good, but their means of getting there range from evil to undesirable. Alternatively, their goals may be selfish or have long-term consequences they don't care about, but they're good people who might even team up with the hero if their goals don't conflict.
They often reach a kind of critical mass that makes them more good than normal villains but not quite heroes, blurring the line between hero and villain the same way an Anti-Hero does, but coming from the opposite direction.
Anti-Villain is an attempt to lighten up a villain as opposed to an Anti-Hero, which has a tendency to darken the hero. Side by side, it can become very hard to tell them apart. The only reason some would even be considered evil at all is when they're the Designated Villain. Despite this humanizing characterization, they are rarely less dangerous. For instance, heroes wouldn't know what to expect if their enemy shows caring and then attacks their reputation, without giving them an excuse to rationalize killing them.
Most of them are probably well aware that what they're doing is ""evil"", unlike the blinded Knight Templar, but strive to maintain a façade of good PR, often by engaging in Pragmatic Villainy. They'll see it as a viable means to a (possibly) good end.
In terms of personality, anti-villains are kind-hearted and can be caring and honorable in nature, even towards their enemies, but it can be possible for them to treat their own allies with rudeness, which by its own accord, is a very unusual trait to possess. Moreover, compared to regular villains that are just simply evil, anti-villains are often neutral - depending on the writers of said characters. Those that are part of the neutral alignments however, aren't exactly benevolent, but they aren't malevolent either, but there also does exist anti-villains that are outright evil in nature, though they still maintain having all of the attributes on what anti-villains usually have in common. They can also be capable of a Heel–Face Turn much more easily than normal villains thanks to their personalities.
It may also be possible to turn a normal villain into an Anti-Villain over time by detailing their Start of Darkness, giving them a Cynicism Catalyst, a Morality Pet, multiple Pet the Dog episodes, or otherwise retconning them into submission. A Freudian Excuse may explain their actions, but almost never changes them into an Anti-Villain if there is nothing good about their present motivations.
See also the Sliding Scale of Anti-Villains. A character who is a Wild Card or a Heel–Face Revolving Door can be capable of being both an Anti-Hero and an Anti-Villain depending on whether or not they are acting for or against the protagonist at the time."
t01117,AnyoneCanDie,"Most of the time when you finally grasp who the main characters of the story are, you can expect that these characters will survive through the end of the story (or at least until the last episode). Well, This Is Not That Trope.
This is very common in Darker and Edgier works. When the writers want to impress you with their ruthlessness, they may trumpet that Tonight, Someone Dies, then kill off a random second-stringer that nobody much cares about. They might even kill off a major character because his actor was leaving anyway, or because they needed a good cliffhanger to convince people to watch the next season. That is also not this trope (although it's pretending to be).
Anyone Can Die is where no one is exempt from being killed, including pets, children, the elderly, even the main characters (maybe even the hero!) The Sacrificial Lamb is often used to establish the writer's willingness to kill off important characters early on. To really be the Anyone Can Die trope, the work must include multiple deaths of named characters, happening at different points in the story. Bonus points if the death is unnecessary and devoid of Heroic Sacrifice.
This trope is very helpful in keeping fans from being Spoiled by the Format. In a kid's show, of course Alice and Bob are going to survive the raging rapids.note Though that depends on the type of kids' show; Magical Princess Minky Momo was written for kids, and its heroine was killed by a truck halfway in. In a work of this type however, the danger actually becomes dangerous.
War shows like Mobile Suit Gundam benefit from having a larger cast since there are so many people to kill off. The frequent deaths within a wide cast make the storyline unpredictable, forcing you to wonder who'll be left standing once the dust settles.
Still, even if all characters are allegedly up for the possibility of a dance with the reaper, the general laws of storytelling (and, more importantly, how actors are contracted) tells us that you can expect the chances of main-character death to increase as you approach the climax of an arc, the final episodes of a season, the final chapters of a book, or the final instalment of a series, even if the work averts Death Is Dramatic. A creator needs to be quite committed to the concept to kill off an important character in a completely plot-irrelevant way.
When used poorly or too frequently, this trope can cause Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy or Eight Deadly Words as the audience won't see any point in getting attached to characters that they expect to die sooner or later.
Note that the character needs to be Killed Off for Real for the trope to have the desired effect; it does not work if the writers cheat and bring back the guy later (see Not Quite Dead, Disney Death, and Climactic Battle Resurrection). As such Super Hero Comic Books as a medium have gained a reputation of ""Anyone Can Die... until someone wants to use the character in a later story.""
A good way to check if this trope applies is to see if who survives is an important plot point, rather than only how they survive.
Contrast with Tonight, Someone Dies, Sorting Algorithm of Mortality and Contractual Immortality. Compare Second Law of Metafictional Thermodynamics. Compare Characters Dropping Like Flies, which is just about lots of people dying, and can overlap with this trope.
See also Kill ’Em All, when everyone will die. Opposite of Nobody Can Die and Plot Armor, where not even situations that should kill people manage to. See also Dwindling Party, where the deaths are evenly spaced rather than near the end. Easier to do in works with Loads and Loads of Characters. Can be expected in a Tragedy. Red Shirt is (usually) when the deaths are reserved for nameless extras. This trope tries to upgrade them to Mauve Shirt first.
This is definitely Truth in Television, because all living organisms are mortal and will eventually die for any number of reasons, with no fiction writers to determine how it happens, so No Real Life Examples, Please!.
As a Death Trope, all spoilers will be unmarked ahead. Beware."
t01136,ApocalypseHow,"While The End of the World as We Know It is very common in fiction, there are a wide variety of ways in which it can actually manifest; this can be measured on two sliding scales, depending on the size of the ""world"" in question, and to exactly what extent it ""ends"". This is derived in part from Bruce Sterling's analysis of ways in which the Real Life world could theoretically end.
Scope
Severity
Not to be confused with the comedy survival guide by Rob Kutner, which gives advice for surviving the relatively low-severity events. Or the Discovery Channel series by the same name which explores various scenarios in which this could play out.

Not to be confused with the movie on whose title this trope is a pun."
t01141,ApocalypticLog,"A story is told through a log, diary, or journal that a character used to document their activities and progress through the backstory before something bad happened to its writer. A staple of Post-Apocalyptic Fiction to explain to the cast how the world ended up the way it is, it can also be used as a handy way to fill in heroes who arrive Late to the Tragedy, and one of the first (or last) things that a ""rescue"" party answering a Distress Call will find.
You can expect that whoever made this log will have recorded events up until their last breath. If the heroes (and thus the audience) choose to read this log from the beginning, the log will no doubt start and progress the same way, with hopeful characters recording the casual details of their lives and work, until things start going sideways and the entries shift towards concern, disbelief, desperation and/or (ultimately) insanity. The final — and usually the most important — entry may range from incoherent gibberish as the remaining character tries to warn the world of what happened to them, to a final cogent statement warning the reader not to repeat their mistake (or how to otherwise clean up after them).
This log can be written or recorded in a variety of ways; if it's a video log, the downhill progress of the situation will be punctuated visually, e.g. degradation in the appearance of the character, their surroundings, or even the video itself. Bonus points if a video log's final entry shows the character ultimately succumbing to whatever horror took over. Grand prize if it's a written log that somehow still records the author's final dying moments.
Depending on the timeframe and nature of the apocalyptic event, the log may have gone through Ragnarök Proofing in order to be legibly retrieved by the heroes.

t01213,ArchaicWeaponForAnAdvancedAge,"There's a certain amount of cultural and symbolic weight to most historical weapons, accurate or not. They invoke a feeling of the Good Old Ways, and may be seen as more honorable, elegant, interesting, or simply cool. They're also traditional in many settings, especially for those that have roots in Medieval European Fantasy, such as Role-Playing Games.
However, even in settings where these weapons should be obsolete and out of place, they often show up and are shown to be just as effective, if not more so, than weapons that are modern to the setting.
This occurs with extreme frequency in Eastern RPGs, probably due to the genre's origins in Dungeons  Dragons. Even in Steampunk and Urban Fantasy settings, you will find swords, axes, spears, katanas, and all other manner of (seemingly, at least) anachronistic weaponry. It also appears in settings with Schizo Tech. It's even possible the character uses this because s/he Doesn't Like Guns. Sometimes it will be justified with a Retro Upgrade (said weapon has become useful again because something's changed) and/or by making it an Enhanced Archaic Weapon.
It's also Truth in Television to an extent. While it's true that the modern battlefield is dominated by guns, hand-to-hand and melee weapon combat training will likely always be a part of military curricula: guns can be cumbersome in close combat and melee weapons are much quieter, so the humble dagger and its modern derivatives will never go out of style.
They are often employed by heroes because Heroes Prefer Swords. Often a result of using the old technology in ways that were Not the Intended Use.
Super-Trope to The Straight and Arrow Path. Compare Break Out the Museum Piece, Older Is Better, Rock Beats Laser, and some forms of Improperly Placed Firearms. See also Elegant Weapon for a More Civilized Age."
t01232,ArcWords,"A word or phrase that appears throughout an Arc as a Motif.
Arc Words can be a way to hint at the Aesop or one of the themes of a show, often in the form of a question the characters must find an answer to. Alternately, they can be used for Foreshadowing.
They're often cryptic, and left unexplained until the Climax or Dénouement. This builds up tension and mystery, and hints that anyone using the words knows more than they're telling. This enigmatic variant is a typical element of a Mind Screw, and is sometimes used as a memetic way of advertising the show.
Arc Words need not have attention drawn explicitly to them; they often rely instead on eagle-eyed/sharp eared viewers noticing for themselves. In the ""Bad Wolf"" example from the first series of the revival of Doctor Who, the words appeared as, among other things, a helicopter's callsign, a reference in dialogue to ""The Big Bad Wolf"", a graffito, and even in other languages (the [inaccurate] German Schlechter Wolf, and the Welsh Blaidd Drwg, the latter tipping off the Doctor about it).
Look for these on the Internet Movie Database ""memorable quotes"" page for the show, with the label ""repeated line"".
The high-browed, academic term used for this is ""Leitwort"" from the German for ""leading"" or ""guiding word"".
When this is a number instead of a phrase, it's Arc Number, and Arc Symbol if it's an image. Compare with Dream Melody. Not to be confused with Arc Reactor Words, which generally have to do with caves and boxes of scraps.
Arc Words are not the same thing as a Running Gag, a Catchphrase, or even just a phrase that ends up popping up a lot due to being used a lot in the plot. ""May the Force be with you"" are not arc words; it's an expression and a social nicety. Arc Words also must help define the tone of their entire work, or at least the plot arc where they appear."
t01250,AristocratsAreEvil,"A lot of tropes have origins way back when media was still forming; this is one of them.
It might have been an early way to appeal to the masses, or just due to the way aristocrats tended to look down on the general public. But it was then and is now really popular to cast aristocrats as villains. A variety of Meaningful Titles exist—people with feudal titles are very commonly evil. Popular titles are Countnote in Britain, they're guaranteed to be foreign, since the equivalent local rank is Earl—probably because in the Medieval Accent it sounded kind of unfortunate, and Baron—two titles which are rarely seen on a good guy. (Oddly enough, a Countess has a better-than-even chance of being a decent woman.note And Britain does have Countesses, it's the female equivalent of an Earl.) And though it doesn't show up a great deal, you should break out in a cold sweat when you meet a Viscount. Unless it's Viscount Horatio Nelson. Interestingly, both counts and barons are fairly common titles among Continental Europeans, but rare among the English, which may suggest a regional bias in which aristocrats are cast as villains.
Needless to say, Barons fare the worst in popular fiction, with one notable exception when used as a badass nickname. Maybe it's something to do with the old nickname ""Sugar Baron"", who makes his wealth off the labour of the poorest of the poor, and from slaves. (In the U.S. this became the ""Robber Baron"", the derogatory term for wealthy industrialists that made their money off the backs of immigrant labor.)
One major exception: Dukes are usually relatively nice. This may be due to the fact the title was awarded to those who rose to aristocracy as war leaders. Thus, the Duke has a ""grass roots"" feel to it, and a badass quality; as well, much like The Good Captain, military titles are generally for good guys, with the possible exceptions of Admiral and Major. Also, before the 18th and 19th centuries, Dukes were generally too high up the ladder of aristocracy to really have much contact with common people at all. Because of this, Dukes were not the nobles that were directly oppressing the common people, and so didn't receive quite the same stigma… especially since in some local cases, a Duke actually ran interference against a lower-ranking nobleman on behalf of the masses. Dukes (and especially Grand Dukes) can be evil if the Hero is a Royal. Often a Duke is scheming to take over the throne himself.
Other titles generally have a more neutral feel to them—Earls tend to be good but quite elderly and senile, while it is rare to see a Marquess in anything other than a particularly faithful historical adaptation. Baronets were quite often villains in both Victorian Melodrama and Wodehousian comedy (not to mention the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta Ruddigore), probably due to the fact that baronetcies could be more or less openly bought, indicating that the character is not only Nouveau Riche, but also ambitious and seeking to rise beyond his station (the worst social sin in Victorian Britain). Queens/Kings may be either good or evil. And, of course, Everything's Better With Princesses (or is it?).
The title Sir is the best of the lot, being martial, unprepossessing, and upwardly mobile. Even actors like to be called Sir.
The title Lord is somewhat problematic as strictly speaking any British or Irish Peer (other than a Duke or Duchess) would be addressed as such. For instance a character named 'Lord Bloggs', might be the Earl of Bloggs, or the Marquess of Bloggs or so on. The title 'Lord -' is also a favorite of a certain type of supernatural villain (Lords Vader and Voldemort, most famously), but are really a separate trope - normally not real aristocrats, and normally not powerful simply because of their titles.
The Prince will almost always be charming, even in the rare cases where that is not actually his name. However, there are two uses of the term. The Prince may be the son of a King, or it may be used to refer to any ruler or leader (re: Machiavelli). If an evil prince ever appears in fiction, be sure to check that it is not in fact the latter. And of course, the Evil Prince may be out to kill the good one.
If it's an Action-Adventure story, you can bet anyone with the title Lady will be a Lady of War.
If there's a Queen then she will be regal and respected or God Save Us from the Queen! Conversely, a Prince is much more likely to be The Wise Prince; compare Fisher King.
Don't even get us started on Emperors or Chancellors. Good luck finding a Marquis, though (though there's at least one infamous example of such).
While East Asian and pre-Columbian noble titles are usually translated - Huangdi and Tlatoani are all simply Emperors, and treated as such - the Middle East has an aristocratic hierarchy of its own. Sheikhs and Sultans used to be romantic, but since the 1970s oil embargo they're almost universally bad news in fiction: typically depicted as corrupt, greedy, lecherous, fat, and smug. Emirs have roughly the same connotations, but the title is even more besmirched because of its use by terrorist leaders. Caliphs, however, are a rarity. This is mostly because the title, while extremely prestigious, was powerless on its own most of the time and is completely gone today, the only claimant being a raving terrorist. That being said, in the short period where the caliphs were relevant - the early Middle Ages - they can be seen in ""Arabian Nights"" Days stories. While these caliphs are usually benevolent, beware of Grand Viziers.
Squires tend to be Quintessential British Gentlemen. They are likely to be rather gruff but good natured under all that. They tend to either be a retired military officer, or a father obsessed with marrying off his daughters or with a wife with the same obsession.
Chiefs tend to be a leader of a tribal community, generally a barbarous one. They will likely be badass because their culture insists that Authority must equal asskicking and may even have gotten their job from Klingon Promotion. Alternatively they are chief of a tribe that has acculturated itself to mundane lifestyles. In that case, expect him to wax poetic about the Good Old Ways.
Several of these kinds of aristocrats together form a Decadent Court.
See also The Baroness and The Caligula. A young aristocrat may fall under Royal Brat.
Aristocrats are often willing to be polite and even with people of their own rank. Moral Myopia, however, often limits it to fellow aristocrats. Commoners are just out of luck — especially servants. If they're not actively in charge, expect them to be part of the Omniscient Council of Vagueness. A Regent for Life will pick any one of these titles, especially if they run the People's Republic of Tyranny. In that case, only when the Rightful King Returns will harmonious social order be restored to the realm.
In most cases, aristocrats are associated exclusively with monarchical and imperial societies. In actual fact, the word aristocrat comes from Athenian democracy. The word comes from the combination of ""Arete"" (Greek for ""the best"" or most virtuous) and ""Kratos"" (power). In other words ""power of the best"". It originally referred to the fact that leading members of Athenian families were supposed to be first in battle and represent the highest and best values of society. The ""best men"" (aristocrats) had the highest voting privileges and greatest power. So an aristocrat is not necessarily exclusive to monarchical and feudal nations. The Romans incidentally, after conquering Greece, used the word ""optimate"" or ""boni"" which meant the same thing in Latin (Best Men/Good Men), and as in the case of Athens, it was often the case that those who possessed the most wealth, prestige, and power were regarded as the best and good men. In England-France-USA, the word Aristocracy in the 18th and 19th Century, was often used in the original classical sense, to describe individuals and interests that restricted suffrage and voting rights.
For the modern version of this trope, see Corrupt Corporate Executive, and to a lesser extent, Nouveau Riche.
Very prone to Screw the Rules, I Have Money!, Screw the Rules, I Make Them!, and Screw the Rules, I Have Connections! Sometimes even prone to Screw the Money, I Have Rules!
Morally Ambiguous Doctorate is also related, insofar as the title of Doctor gives the Mad Scientist some implied legitimacy.
If there are any German or Dutch Evil Aristocrat in the fiction, The Von Trope Family might please us with the delight of their company.
For more information on the British title system, see Knight Fever. Not to be confused with The Aristocrats, a ""stock joke"" based on this premise.
This trope often goes hand in hand with Slobs vs. Snobs. See also, Eat the Rich and Kill the Poor."
t01284,ArrangedMarriage,"An Arranged Marriage is, quite simply, the idea that someone is going to choose your spouse for you.
The way an Arranged Marriage is treated by the plot will be dependent on place and time. For most of human history, arranged marriages were the norm because ""marriage"" was less about the union of two souls and more about the union of two families. The rise of the ""Marry for Love"" ideal didn't really start in Western culture until the 16th century, and there are places on Earth where it still hasn't. Additionally, the ""Marriage Before Romance"" trope often went hand-in-hand with arranged marriages. While the priority is, again, the union of two families, that union is dependent on the stability and comfort of the two people getting married, so the two families would try their best to come up with a Perfectly Arranged Marriage. The couple's happiness just wasn't the main goal the way it is in Western marriages today.
However, the one thing that is almost always present in an arranged marriage is tension. Most people don't really want to marry a total stranger (much less have sex with them), and if that total stranger turns out to be a complete rogue and a cad, it may be necessary for the heroes to spring into action and rescue the hapless member of their group who is being forced to walk down the aisle. (Of course, being Big Damn Heroes, they'll have to do so in the most overblown and dramatic way possible.) Sometimes, the person in the arranged marriage takes matters into their own hands and becomes a Runaway Fiancé. The ""aggrieved"" party may claim Breach of Promise of Marriage in response, as arranged marriages tend to be viewed as legally binding commitments by those who initiate it. Alternately, there's a Love Triangle. The character of the suitor is less likely to be important in those cases, but they generally won't look kindly on the outsider's interference.
Conversely, an Arranged Marriage can be used to lock the hero and heroine together so that their disputes can not end with one of them washing their hands of the other.
A common tactic is for the daughter of a wealthy but common family to be matched with the Impoverished Patrician, for his title: Nobility Marries Money. Occasionally, it's the other way around, with a titled daughter and a moneyed son. Families may even pledge infant children in marriage pacts that cannot be concluded until many years later.
Both in fiction and in Real Life, royal children (sons as well as daughters) were used as pawns in the political game cementing alliances and peace treaties with their marriages. You might say it was their job to take part in such Altar Diplomacy.
The Arranged Marriage is not to be confused with: a Childhood Marriage Promise (whereby a prepubescent couple voluntarily pledges their own non-legally-binding, future troth); a marriage which may arise out of convenience; or a marriage that arises from some kind of cultural mistake. For clarity's sake, the Arranged Marriage trope will deal only with more binding, traditional types of unions.
See also Parental Marriage Veto, You Have Waited Long Enough, Old Man Marrying a Child, Homosocial Heterosexuality, Royal Inbreeding, and Marriage Before Romance. A Shotgun Wedding is a short-notice forced marriage. If someone agrees to an Arranged Marriage but loves someone else, Courtly Love may be involved. If the people doing the ""arranging"" in the marriage aren't the parents, that's a Bureaucratically Arranged Marriage.
Often involves Prince Charmless and Rebellious Princess. At least recently, one of the potential spouses was as likely as not to try to defy this. When the audience really doesn't want this marriage, expect the Big Damn Heroes to show up right at the Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace line.
To see the types of follies and foibles associated with modern dating services, see Dating Service Disaster. Supertrope to Perfectly Arranged Marriage. Subtrope of Marriage of Convenience. Contrast Marry for Love. Compare And Now You Must Marry Me. Compare and contrast Fourth Date Marriage, where the couple likewise barely knows each other but it was Love at First Sight."
t01294,ArsonMurderAndJaywalking,"When listing three or more things, the comedy rule is to not finish strong, but to list some strong examples followed by a very weak example, for the funny. Sometimes this will stick to the Rule of Three, but sometimes a proper Long List will increase the humor.
In the US and Canada, ""jaywalking"" means crossing the road in a dangerous manner, particularly ignoring the crosswalks when crossing city streets. In many other countries, not only are there almost no restrictions on where you can cross, but the idea of someone being fined for crossing the road is alien. In places where jaywalking is illegal, it's usually an infraction (i.e. like a parking ticket) rather than a proper criminal offense, and some cities don't even bother to enforce it.
See also: List of Transgressions, Arson, Murder, and Lifesaving, Felony Misdemeanor, Good News, Bad News, Odd Name Out, The Triple. Compare Poke the Poodle, All Crimes Are Equal, Jaywalking Will Ruin Your Life, when the minor crime carries significant consequences. The inverse is Bread, Eggs, Milk, Squick, where a list of seemingly mundane things ends with something much darker. Clue, Evidence, and a Smoking Gun is a related inverse that deals with deductions rather than listing things. Sub-Trope of The Last of These Is Not Like the Others."
t01305,ArtifactOfDoom,"The Artifact of Doom is an unusual villain in that it is a (seemingly) inanimate object that somehow manages to be pure evil. It is the threat of corruption and falling to The Dark Side. It may also cause Great Insanity, death, or worse.
This item has a palpable presence beyond merely being a device. Its threat is ever constant, whether destroying those it directly opposes, or consuming those who dare use it from within with dark whispers of power. Nonetheless, it is incapable of action on its own; its power lies in manipulating its user to act for it. Therein lies the irony: if people would just leave the damn thing alone, it would be harmless, but since Evil Feels Good, some idiot will inevitably try it out and doom us all.
There will be a conflict among the heroes, between those who say they should dare to use its power and resist or purify the corrupting effects; and those feel it should be destroyed/sealed. The artifact will often make this conflict escalate to a Hate Plague with deadly consequences. This may be explicitly stated as one of its powers in the case of the Artifact of Attraction.
Still think it's worth the risk? Think you can handle it? After all, once you realize how evil it is, all you have to do is get rid of it or destroy it... Both of which are easier said than done.
Often has An Aesop on how power corrupts and over-reliance on technology/magic is a bad thing.
If the artifact is a wearable item that refuses to come off (or you will never want or think about taking it off), then it's also a Clingy MacGuffin. If it's a Dismantled MacGuffin, then reassembling it is required to get the Set Bonus.
Usually found at half-price at The Little Shop That Wasn't There Yesterday, or handed out by the Evil Mentor (if he hasn't turned himself into the artifact). If It Was a Gift, do not trust the giver thereafter.
Sub Tropes include the Tome of Eldritch Lore, Evil Weapon, Evil Mask, and the Summoning Artifact. Occasionally doubles as an Artifact of Death. More often, it is an Amulet of Dependency. Often overlaps with Happy Fun Ball when the artifact appears to be something harmless or mundane. The Soul Jar of an evil character almost always doubles as one of these. May also be the can of Sealed Evil in a Can. See also Sentient Phlebotinum and Holy Is Not Safe when the artifact was made by the good guys but still dangerous.
Not to be confused with the Artifact of Doom 3. Completely unrelated to The Artifact."
t01342,ArtisticLicenseGunSafety,"Guns are dangerous things; they're designed with the primary purpose of using a projectile to injure or kill whatever it's fired at. Such power needs to be respected, and it shouldn't be surprising that there are various obvious safety rules in place when using a gun, that anybody who wants to use a firearm should know. Even then an expert can conceivably make a serious (and possibly fatal) mistake when handling a gun. There is even a saying among gunsmiths that ""There are two types of gun owners. Those who have had their guns discharge accidentally, and those who will have their guns discharge accidentally.""
Many writers, actors, artists, and directors, however, ignore these rules. What results from this are scenes where characters are doing things they shouldn't, such as placing their fingers on the triggers of their weapons when not about to fire, or pointing their weapons at people whom they are not trying to shoot; one particularly common example is foolish officers making routine arrests (e.g. drunk driving or check fraud) at gunpoint for no real reason. This is particularly troublesome when these people are supposed to be experts with lots of experience with their weapons.
The distinction between this trope and Reckless Gun Usage is that this involves people who either should know gun safety based on their profession, or are stated to have extensive experience with firearms while Reckless Gun Usage involves people who are likely not familiar with basic firearm safety. If this is done for comedic purposes it's Juggling Loaded Guns. If this shows up and somebody gets shot, it's I Just Shot Marvin in the Face. If the rules are followed and somebody gets shot anyway, that's Reliably Unreliable Guns going off. Firing in the Air a Lot is always a case of this, as are Pants-Positive Safety and Gun Twirling. The trope also usually goes hand in hand with Stray Shots Strike Nothing.
May also be the writer hinting that a character isn't as professional as he should be.
See Guns Do Not Work That Way, for links to Tropes of the most common offenders.
Note that there is a very good reason why all of the examples here are listed under Artistic License, as trying to actually replicate any of them could lead — and has led — to accidents, many of them fatal. For obvious reasons, Don't Try This at Home.
The Four Rules of gun safety:"
t01376,AscendedExtra,"A minor character who is given a greatly expanded role in the later part of the series, a new adaptation of a story, or in the Expanded Universe. It is usually safer to do this with an otherwise obscure character without much depth, since the likelihood of creating plot contradictions is lower. On the other hand, the character may or may not be allowed to have a huge effect on the plot depending on how much the writer is trying to follow source material. Can lead to some bizarre incongruities in planning (e.g. Overtook the Manga, Restricted Expanded Universe). Sometimes the minor character becomes an Ascended Extra just so the writers can immediately turn them into a Sacrificial Lion.
This naturally occurs as a series goes on for long periods of time and useful for filler, technically not requiring you invent someone whole cloth. Be warned however that this character might be more liked by the fandom than the writers, who may have no compunction with getting rid of them when convenient.
If a series involves a Time Skip between seasons or story arcs (or if time travel involves someone taking The Slow Path), this can happen when a character who was a child in the first part grows up enough to have an impact on the plot.
This also happens somewhat regularly in Fan Fiction, often when writers feel a character has potential that wasn't fully exploited in the original source. See also O.C. Stand-in, They Wasted a Perfectly Good Character.
Compare the Breakout Character, where a supporting character gains a fandom that rivals or exceeds the main characters and thus becomes more prominent in canon. Compare also the Ensemble Dark Horse where in a similar fashion, a supporting character role remains the same but that character receives more fans . See Breakout Villain specifically for when a would-be one-shot villain ascends to Big Bad status, either through Ascended Extra or Breakout Character. A One-Scene Wonder is not an Ascended Extra, at least officially; fanfic, on the other hand...
See Mauve Shirt for when a member of the Redshirt Army gets his own name and minor characterization, but still doesn't become more than a minor supporting character in any way. For the villain equivalent, see Mook Promotion. The inverse of this trope is Demoted to Extra. Retroactive Recognition is when this happens in Real Life. O.C. Stand-in is when this happens in a fanfic.
Compare Red Herring Shirt, only the ascension is intended from the beginning, and Ensemble Dark Horse, where fans become fascinated by a character who canonically has only a very small role, at least initially.
Also, contrast with Demoted to Extra."
t01384,AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence,"The character ascends to a higher state of being, even becoming a god. It can result from other supernatural causes, but is most often used as a character's fate after they die, in a riff on the idea of a heavenly afterlife.
It is mostly a way to pay off a character. Or play off, in some cases. A way to put the character on a bus, though that's not all that it's used for. If the writers should need the character back, it can be very easy to reverse, in which case the character will De-Power as a God in Human Form. Sometimes the accession isn't even meant to be permanent if the writer needs some way for a character to enter a higher plane, then leave with something important like knowledge or a new power. If the character has left their clothes behind, untouched, it's a case of Shapeshifting Excludes Clothing.
The Singularity can cause whole populations to ascend.
Expect examples of this trope to make use of the words ""ascend"" and ""above"" in line with Heaven Above, where the divine and supernatural are associated with the sky above us. Compare Winged Soul Flies Off at Death. Contrast Cessation of Existence.

As a Death Trope, all Spoilers will be unmarked ahead. Beware."
t01428,AssholeVictim,"Normally when something bad happens to an individual you feel some degree of pity for them. But then when that person is a Jerkass, when horrible things happen to them it's less sympathy and more satisfaction. They may not be directly responsible for THIS particular misfortune, as that would be Laser-Guided Karma, but their behavior means something like this was going to happen eventually. This can range from the victim merely being a dick to being a far worse criminal than the person he or she is a victim to.
In other words, when a corpse-shaped or victim-shaped hole in the plot is filled with a character who is in some way sufficiently repugnant, the audience feeling bad about their death/victimization is unlikely.note Note that the character doesn't have to die, just that they be victimized in some way beyond their control; in some cases, ""victim-shaped hole"" can mean ""victim of non-violent theft"".
This trope can show up for a variety of reasons, but a common one is to make the criminal (or Non-Malicious Monster) into a Sympathetic Murderer. This is especially likely if the Asshole Victim's dickery is what motivated the criminal to commit the crime in the first place. This often occurs in works that feature an Anti-Hero or Villain Protagonist; their victims are such horrible people that the protagonist looks heroic by comparison, and/or Start of Darkness stories will have the protagonist's first victims be terrible people so they don't lose audience sympathy at the beginning of the tale.
Further, there are structural reasons for engaging in this trope: Given that, in many of these situations, the story requires either a Victim of the Week or an early death to make clear the stakes, putting an asshole of some variety in the corpse-shaped hole in your plot brings up less of the ""Tonight, someone will be killed for your entertainment"" Fridge Logic.
See Who Murdered the Asshole? when an entire murder mystery revolves around the investigation of who killed an Asshole Victim. Compare Pay Evil unto Evil, where otherwise evil actions are portrayed as OK as long as the victims deserve it. Conversely, someone may protest If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him. Kick the Son of a Bitch is when the bad guy is genuinely malicious and without a sympathetic motivation in the slightest, but their victim just happened to be an asshole. The de facto target of the Vigilante Man, and by definition the target of the Serial-Killer Killer, the Wife-Basher Basher, the Karmic Thief, and those on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. May be combined with Mugging the Monster when the the victim of this trope does not realize that the person he or she is trying to bully is more than capable of defending himself/herself.
While the Real Life violent deaths of certain dictators and certain kinds of criminals might qualify for this trope, which ones qualified and which ones didn't would be endlessly debated, depending on your perspective, so we kindly ask that you refrain from adding any real life examples."
t01447,AsTheGoodBookSays,"Having a character quote from The Bible lets us know they're either a scholar, a priest, a deeply religious person, a bonafide supernatural being or a psychopath.
A Bible quote can be an effective literary tool if used in a meaningful context, but, outside it, it's an obvious, major cop-out. It has been observed before that even the devil could quote the bible to his own advantage by choosing his verses with care.note  This happens in The Bible itself, even: see Luke 4:9-10. Parodies may include entirely fake and comical-sounding biblical verses, word swaps in the well-known verses which entirely change their meaning, or quoting some other book, mundane but supposedly holy to this character, in the manner clearly reminiscent of the Bible. The parody can also involve one character misquoting the Bible to point out that another character's quote is not actually from the Bible, either.
Commonly used for Love Is Like Religion. Compare Literary Allusion Title, which often serves a similar purpose. Contrast Useful Book, where a ""good book"" means something else entirely. See also Speaks in Shout-Outs."
t01459,AsYouKnow,"As you know, we are Describing the trope As You Know Here.
This is a form of exposition where one character explains to another something that they both know, but the audience doesn't or may have forgotten.
In discussions of science fiction, this is often ""As You Know, Bob"" (abbreviated AYKB), or occasionally, ""Tell me, Professor [about this marvelous invention we all use every day and have no reason to be talking about except to inform the audience]"". Other common variations involve a newspaper reporter sent to cover events, or a conversation between two supporting characters — hence another name, ""maid and butler dialogue"". Terry Pratchett refers to the fantasy fiction version as the ""As you know, your father, the king..."" speech.
This is also a common feature of pilot episodes, where characters' backgrounds and relationships need to be established for the first time. Likewise, when new characters are introduced or the writers believe a reminder is in order, characters will explicitly refer to each other by name during a regular conversation, when this is rarely done in real life: ""Say, Alice, how are you enjoying your coffee?"" ""Why, it's delicious, Bob, thanks for asking. How are you coming along, Charlie?""
This is also quite common on medical drama shows like ER, Scrubs, and Grey's Anatomy, where common medical phenomena and simple procedures must be explained to the laymen in the audience. In most cases, this is achieved by explaining the disease or procedure to an intern or non-professional character.
On some shows, characters will ""As You Know"" in order to provide information that was already provided in a previous episode (that viewers might have missed) or even earlier in the show (for those who just tuned in), to the great annoyance of dedicated fans. (e.g. Just Tuned In: ""Remember, Bob, you only have 20 minutes to defuse the bomb..."" or Previous Episode: ""Alice is really mad at you for running over her dog last week, isn't she?"") Soap operas or adventure-type shows will often circumvent this with a ""When we last left our heroes"" recap at the beginning of each two-parter.
This may also happen with solitary characters (in thought rather than in speech), who, apparently, have such bad memory problems that they have to constantly remind themselves what they're doing right now and what happened in the near past.
Not explaining anything sometimes results in the audience being too busy trying to figure out what's going on to enjoy the show, using this trope is not always a bad thing. In serialized works or plays, ""as you know"" is seen as a convenient workaround to save time or to spare readers returning to the series. For example, it's easier to say ""as you know, Dr. Moriarty is the most feared criminal mastermind in the world"" than showing to new readers to the Sherlock Holmes series just what kind of criminal the doctor is. Or, it often would be more advantageous to a play's length to say ""as you know, the Montagues and Capulets have been feuding for 50 years"" than to show a fifty-year-long feud. Notwithstanding, there are less obvious workarounds in use in modern writing.
Writers try to avoid this by using The Watson, and thus the most common alternative is to give the protagonist amnesia so he doesn't know, which isn't really considered a better option. The Idiot Hero and Fish out of Water are also acceptable tropes to employ to make this trope more believable, though shoehorning in such a character may be worse. A third form is to have two characters comparing information to each be sure that the other does in fact know. A fourth is to have the characters have an argument, since arguments are among the few real-life situations in which people remind each other of things they both already know.note ""How could you do X? You know perfectly well that Y..."" Breaking the Fourth Wall to have the characters know they are informing the audience is Older Than Feudalism in its own right, but obviously suitable only for broadly comic works.
It was ridiculously common in post-World War II literature, to the point that readers expected it and could become confused if the writer left it out. This might be the most universal trope found in postwar literature; you find it in works by everyone from George Orwell to Barbara Cartland to Rex Stout. (One wonders which one of the three would be most insulted by that grouping.)
Generally more acceptable when dealing with characters who are in situations where exposition is actually going on in-universe, e.g. military briefings or scientific lectures. In these cases, the phrase is less used to explain something and more to bring focus to a particular fact. (""As you know, we lost contact with Delta Squad this morning..."" or ""As you may know, the proton has a mass of..."")

t01507,AttemptedRape,"Someone is about to be raped, but at the last minute, the rapist is foiled. Violently. This can happen in one of two ways. If the victim is particularly tough, she (or more rarely he) fights the rapist off themself. Alternatively, they will be rescued by someone else. Depending on who does the rescuing, this can fuel Bodyguard Crush or start a Rescue Romance.
Not to be confused with Near-Rape Experience, where the would-be rapist stops of their own free will. Distinct from Date Rape Averted in that there is no date, and the rapist must, by necessity, be stopped violently — no amount of yelling and slapping is going to work as a deterrent.
It is not unknown for the would-be rapist to offer a rescuer a chance to join in (and then be shocked when it makes him/her angrier).
Popular in fanfiction, especially for the aforementioned Bodyguard Crush and Rescue Romance. Can result in Big Damn Heroes."
t01545,AuthorAppeal,"A kind of Fanservice where the presence of a particular gimmick or kink is so widespread and prominent that it is interpreted as a specific reason the creator actually produced the work. Often, this can overlap with a certain philosophy the author espouses; for instance, an ""enlightened culture"" in The Future may have no nudity taboo, or may have everyone bisexual, remove all body hair at birth, et cetera. Deliberately satirical or political stories often invoke associated Take That! moments.
Author Appeal is perhaps the single leading cause of Mary Sue characters and Mega Crossover settings. Beyond just being written from the ground up to appeal to the author's baser interests, most writers can't help but to then derail the storyline and other characters to facilitate the character; that's the line where Author Appeal gets out of hand.
Interestingly, with careful handling, Author Appeal can still remain subtext which may not be detected until much later. On the flipside, an audience who enjoys a work specifically because of Author Appeal can be easy to produce work for, if the rarity of such works sufficiently balances out any faults with the work itself. Sometimes Author Appeal nets you not only people with similar interests, but people on the receiving end of those interests who may be flattered to be an object of an author's/fandom's affection.
Compare Fanservice, Author Tract, Writer on Board, Filibuster Freefall, and Mary Suetopia. Inversion of Author Phobia, in which the creator uses their personal dread in a work. Contrast Playing to the Fetishes (the former name for Fanservice) when it seems like the author is acting out a personal fetish but is in fact just playing to a niche demographic. Very common in Fanfiction.
If a writer's early work contains obvious Author Appeal, and their later work doesn't, this may overlap with Old Shame.
Creator Thumbprints are often this.
See also Write What You Know, which can be similar to and overlap with Author Appeal, but is when the author writes about something because they know about it rather than any particular personal attraction."
t01546,AuthorAvatar,"A fictionalized version of an author who appears as a character in the events of the story is often called upon to comment upon the situation, deliver the author's verdict, and possibly break the Fourth Wall in a self-deprecating fashion. The author character will usually not influence the plot and may be only loosely tied to the goings-on, their appearances being quite random. The highfalutin literary term for a character designed to express the author's preferred opinions is the raisonneur—here at TV Tropes, the preferred term is Author Avatar.
How this ""random"" character knows the characters and their minor issues is rarely explained within the context of the series. Very often, it is stated or implied that the avatar is the Narrator.
This is typically a holdover from comedic comics, in which the author of a series appears in the show in a self-mocking way. The Author Avatar sometimes appears as the Only Sane Man, though rarely as the Straight Man. Sometimes names will be changed to protect the guilty.
If the Author Avatar is idealized to a fault, always gets the last word, is always shown to be right and starts correcting the world around them, then let the reader beware: the author has just created a Canon Sue. Given the nature of the character, the Author Avatar is often called to deliver an Author Filibuster from time to time.
The other way to go is with Self-Deprecation; the characters will use the meeting to Rage Against the Author or ask Who Writes This Crap?!, or threaten him with violence, if they don't actually commit it. After all, the author put their characters through a lot in the name of drama—just imagine what Buffy the Vampire Slayer would say (or do) to Joss Whedon if she had the chancenote He is fond of making his characters suffer for drama, and said that one of Buffy's principles was ""Buffy happy = bad"".
More self-conscious, but still confident authors might for a more balanced approach, and end up giving their avatar a voice that is more less equal to the other characters in their narrative. In these cases, the Author Avatar's viewpoint will be prestented as vaild, but also coming with a set of flaws. The other characters will challenge the author stand-in on his views, and can even reject them, without the narrative casting any sigficant judgement on them for it. This is especially common in interactive mediums, such Role-Playing Games and Tabletop RPGs, where writers, aware that their audience might not fully agree with their own view-points, will in some cases allow the Player Character a chance to partly agree or directly disagree with it.
Often, the avatar will show up on product logos and random artwork within the show.
Subtrope of Psychological Projection. If the character has a role in the plot, see Write Who You Know and Life Embellished. When done in works, most often Fan Fic, and the avatar becomes a central figure in the story, it becomes a Self-Insert Fic. It has also been done for decades in Western Comic Books since the Silver Age, possibly predating its Manga usage. It should not be confused with Creator Cameo since a cameo may include the creator just being in the background doing nothing or actually playing a character not meant to be them.
An old trope of The Forties and Fifties is the ""personal fallacy"", the idea that everything in fiction is derived directly from Real Life. Some went as far as to state that any character that even faintly resembled the author had to be an Author Avatar or even a Mary Sue. Needless to say, this was often taken too far: see the article on Dorothy L. Sayers for a particularly Anvilicious example.
Such characters will often have Author Powers. Compare Muse Abuse, to which the Author Avatar is often both victim and perpetrator."
t01549,AuthorFilibuster,"It's worth noting that the creation of a story, especially those of works of fiction, may entice readers into receiving the message in an interesting manner but in fact, it neither adds nor subtracts evidence from a point of view. It may display evidence, it may make an argument using that evidence, it may convince the reader using that evidence. Authors should remember this, though: a work of fiction doesn't prove anything. The fact that the author expects to take their fictional world as instantly applicable to real life is part of what makes this trope so grating, but whether or not any specific reader considers an Author Filibuster a good or bad thing is usually dependent on whether or not the reader agrees with the content of the filibuster.
If the author's opinion is the purpose of the work, it's an Author Tract. If this is the climax of the book, it's often a case of Talking the Monster to Death. If a character is delivering the rant, it's also a Character Filibuster. A main cause of Don't Shoot the Message."
t01556,AuthorTract,"All writers put something of themselves into their stories, but some of them go just that little bit too far. For them, the real point of writing is not to shape worlds or create characters, but to preach their ideological beliefs.
This is not always a bad thing. For some works, the premise is simply a way of putting a political point across in an interesting and imaginative way. Also, sometimes things just have to be said in the most blatant way possible to be understood. However, when the message comes across as forced or one-sided, it may prevent some readers from enjoying the book and it will hinge upon where an individual puts their line for where it becomes annoying.
Note that this only applies when the entire universe and characters have been created to put forward the author's viewpoint. If an existing fictional universe or character has been altered to create a medium for a track, then it's due to a Writer on Board (Author Filibuster is an extreme example of that). If the author's just filling up their story with stuff they like, that's Author Appeal. If it's gotten to the point where the tracting (or whatever personal issues the author has) has all but taken over the author's work, then the author has entered Filibuster Freefall.
Contrast What Do You Mean, It's Not Didactic?. May overlap with Artistic License and Take That!. If being an Author Tract is the whole point of the work, see Propaganda Piece."
t01625,AxCrazy,"An ""ax-crazy"" character is someone who is psychologically unstablenote ""Unstable"" is an excessively mild term here, because it implies that some residual stability may still be present. Being Ax-Crazy usually implies that almost the entire substructure of sanity is gone and presents a clear and present danger to others. They are capable of extreme violence, whether carried out with a Slasher Smile, insane laughter, speaking in a Creepy Monotone, or out and out murderous rage, and with no way of knowing just what will set them off, which makes them extremely frightening to deal with. This mainly differentiates them from other eccentric characters who may themselves be obsessive, weird or seemingly crazy, but use this condition hand in hand with doing good, or at least not being in the way. However, some formerly established heroes can go through an episode of ax-craziness and still retain their heroic mantle.
Despite the title, ax-crazies aren't limited to wielding axes. Any instrument of death will do, from knives or straight razors to swords to chainsaws and beyond. A good number of other ax-crazies are also Trigger Happy, preferring either Hand Cannons that blow really big holes in people, or weapons that allow them to kill lots of people with reckless abandon, such as any automatic weapon. And for the truly psychopathic among psychopaths for whom the above just won't do, a heaping helping of high explosives or a good-sized flamethrower will do quite nicely. Sometimes, they don't even need weapons and just use magic spells or other powers if they have them. There are also plenty who are just as happy to beat people into an unrecognizable pulp-like mass with their bare hands.
It is rare for a truly Ax-Crazy character to be a protagonist, largely due to it being a Sub-Trope of Obviously Evil, and most Ax-Crazy characters usually are Obviously Evil. They're common as the antagonists in Superhero and Crime and Punishment Series, often serving as a Psycho for Hire. If they are a protagonist, they will most certainly be a Nominal Hero or Villain Protagonist. The difference between them and Blood Knight is this trope is all about killing while the Blood Knight is only interested in fighting. There is, of course, plenty of room for overlap.
See also Insane Equals Violent, The Butcher, The Dreaded, Mad Bomber, Cute and Psycho, Blood Knight, Psycho for Hire, Yandere, The Sociopath, Mad Doctor, Pyro Maniac, Hair-Trigger Temper, Colonel Kilgore, General Ripper, Insane Admiral, Sociopathic Soldier, Holy Is Not Safe and Jerkass Gods. Compare and contrast Mama Bear, Papa Wolf, Big Brother Instinct, and Violently Protective Girlfriend, who may be capable of temporary Ax-Craziness when their kids, younger sibling(s) or mate are under threat, but are often played sympathetically. Compare Hot-Blooded, in which the character may have such tendencies but in a less threatening way (even if both could overlap).
Contrast Suicidal Pacifism, when a character never, ever resorts to violence even if it is necessary; and Extreme Doormat, when a character is a complete pushover unable to fight back.
The canonical Character Alignment for most Ax-Crazy characters is Chaotic or Neutral Evil, though a couple of Chaotic Neutral examples exist. Sometimes The Unfettered, depending on whether they feel freed or enslaved by their bloodlust. At least one or more examples are an Antivillian, where you kinda feel bad for them since their enemies pushed them too far with actions such as killing their family, their friends, or even the enemies trying to kill them, making them go Ax-Crazy.
It's very common to be Played for Drama, usually as either the Big Bad, or The Dragon to the the Big Bad. It is far less common, but not unheard of, for it to be Played for Laughs; this is most likely to be seen in a Sadist Show, especially one featuring a lot of Comedic Sociopathy and/or heavy Satire, with it appearing most often in humorous comic strips, Anime, Web Original works, and the more adult-oriented Western Animation of the Renaissance and Millennium periods.
A very large number of pages link to this when they should link to An Axe to Grind. This page is about violent crazy people, not people whose Weapon of Choice is an axe (despite the potential for overlap)."
t01630,BabiesEverAfter,"Sometimes you have a Happily Ever After situation, but it just isn't heartwarming enough. Maybe the marriage happened earlier in the season; perhaps the couple was already betrothed but weren't able to consummate the union. Perhaps you need some Dénouement to confirm that, yes, really, it really was happy. Maybe the Bittersweet Ending is short on ""sweet"". Or, maybe, you just want to make things as sweet as possible. The answer? Skip ahead a bit to show the Happily Married couple...and their adorable new baby. Awwwww!
Or, if we cut to the future, show them at home with their growing children. Generally a whole brood, as a mundane equivalent to Fertile Feet, or demonstrating that Mordor has No Ontological Inertia. The older the children, obviously the more years have passed in peace, proving more of the ""Ever After"" part of the happy ending. Grow Old with Me in an epilogue may feature grandchildren, or even great-grandchildren. (See also Hope Sprouts Eternal.) If the ending is not Cleaning Up Romantic Loose Ends, unmatched friends often appear in the role of Honorary Uncle; conversely, Weddings for Everyone may result in loads of underfoot children. And expect the newborns to be named after dead friends or teammates who had made Heroic Sacrifices during the course of the story, clearing the path for the heroes' victory at the cost of their own lives.
It seems that the Law of Inverse Fertility gets inverted once you get past the climax. Even if one or both were confirmed as sterile — such is The Power of Love. The likelihood of this increases exponentially every time one or both people say they don't want to have a kid, or express reluctance to. (Makes many parents very happy.)
The Bittersweet Ending often shows a Dead Guy Junior in this situation. Her Heart Will Go On may entail the discovery that she is pregnant after the father is dead: he's gone, but he's left her Someone to Remember Him By.
If the couple had a child early in the story, perhaps resulting in a Shotgun Wedding, this may result in a younger brother or sister.
Might involve a Screaming Birth, but this is, of course, optional; the baby itself is what makes this trope run, so the cuter the better.
Sequels to works with these sort of endings often make the kids into major characters.
The rationale for this trope is related to Babies Make Everything Better. Compare Birth/Death Juxtaposition. Not to be confused with Wave of Babies.
Naturally, this is an Ending Trope, so spoilers ahoy!"
t01691,BadassBookworm,"These characters are quiet, smart, and seemingly physically unimposing, but with Hidden Depths of formidable physical and practical skills. They are Brains and Brawn, with brains dominant, if not quite Strong and Skilled.
Their physical abilities might result from applying their genius to solve physical challenges like math problems. Their attention to detail might also result in a Diagnosis from Dr. Badass. While some badass bookworms are surprisingly strong, others might be Weak, but Skilled, relying on flawless technique or supernatural abilities. Sometimes a bookworm can lack any special physical traits, but has access to an Impossibly Cool Weapon or enough firepower to make toe-to-toe combat, as they say, academic. A favorite weapon of the bookworm might even be what's always close at hand.
Elderly examples are often Old Masters who have spent decades contemplating philosophy and punching trees in half. Another common type is the Adventurer Archaeologist, who spends as much time studying in the University as that type does evading the poison-tipped arrows of angry natives. If the bookworms are a bit ditzy, expect them to be Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass. If they prefer not to fight, doing so only when they must, then they have Minored in Ass-Kicking. They are very likely to wear Specs of Awesome. In a Five-Man Band specializing in Brains, a Badass Bookworm might as well be The Big Guy.
The trope is the converse of Genius Bruiser. A Badass Bookworm looks like your standard geek, but then displays a surprising amount of physical prowess, whereas a Genius Bruiser looks big, strong and tough, then unexpectedly shows off an intellectual side. See Muggle with a Degree in Magic if their bookworm side is what's making them impressive.
Note this is a different trope from the typical Secret Identity superhero like early Peter Spider-Man Parker, as no one suspects the nerd to be the superhero. Overlaps with Dork Knight. Book Dumb is the Evil Counterpart to this trope, as they're badass, but idiotic."
t01712,BadassNormal,"In a world with supernatural dealings or superpowers, this character is the one who is able to keep being useful through intellect, martial arts abilities, general ruthlessness, or just being Crazy-Prepared.
They notably have none of the fantastic enhancements, magic, or special powers that others do. It might even be a sore point for them, but that just makes us encourage them more.
It's become increasingly common for the Badass Normal to be a protagonist, as he is easier to relate to for us ordinary Muggles in contrast to the often-unrealistic ideal lead. If they are in The Team, then they are usually The Leader, or at least the brains of the outfit, to compensate.
Often overlaps with Non-Powered Costumed Hero in superhero settings — to the point that that trope page was made to help people avoid confusing the two concepts.
If a Badass Normal is capable of things that should only be superhuman, then they have a Charles Atlas Superpower. If Badass runs in their family, it's because Lamarck Was Right. If they are given superpowers after being non-powered for a while, you get an Empowered Badass Normal. If they only lost powers they actually used to have, they've been Brought Down to Badass.
The Badass Normal only happens as a Muggle to be compared in a world of superpowers, fantastic elements, gods, widespread genetic engineering, tranhumanism or other artificial enhancements (like magic). Similarly, just dealing with the inhuman or strange (that's your zombies, orcs, Alien Invasion and other invocations of Puny Earthlings) doesn't suffice unless there was some other superhero who showed how they needed their powers for the same job.
Just because someone was able to kill one Super Soldier out of ten in the world does not make them a badass normal. Likewise, this is not a character who is ill equipped with outdated technology, even if their enemies are top-of-the-line. Nor do they qualify if they're undertrained while dealing with a superior trained enemy (unless said training confers superpowers/artificial enhancements that the untrained lack). By all means it should be a topic of debate with anyone they deal with (enemy, ally or even themselves) if their lack of superpowers is an issue with their usefulness.
It's important to note if they have strange or superhuman abilities, they are not normal. There is no ""relatively"" when it comes to Badass Normal. It doesn't matter if you can ""barely"" lift a tank, your ki blasts can ""only"" level cities, your Bio-Augmentation is standard issue, or your ability to alter the fabric of reality isn't as developed as others; you're a badass with superpowers. Not everyone can be the Batman of the setting. However, if he avoids or cannot uses his powers for combat, he probably Fights Like a Normal.
Often overlaps with The Team Normal (if this character joins a superpowered team).
This is a Super-Trope of Badass Bystander. By definition always on level 1 in Super Weight.
Compare Muggles Do It Better, Unfazed Everyman, Weak, but Skilled, Puny Earthlings, and especially Heart Is an Awesome Power. A Hunter of Monsters frequently is one, though there are just as many Hunter of His Own Kind or Fur Against Fang variants.
Contrast with Overshadowed by Awesome, where a character is by reasonable means strong compared to regular people or even superpowerful, but can only be considered ""normal"" when compared to the people they hang out with, who are vastly stronger. Because of this, they often Can't Catch Up. Also contrast Super Loser, for characters who are anything but badass despite having superpowers. Brought Down to Normal arcs can show a super powered individual can be badass without their powers but that does not qualify them for this trope. This is a character type, not a plot trope.
Note for Tropers: This trope only applies if the setting possesses a significant number of characters with superpowers. In a setting where superpowers are very uncommon or nonexistent, badass characters without superpowers are just badass. If you encounter an instance of a character in a setting without superpowers being called a Badass Normal, please remove or change it. For average people that are forced to be a badass by the situation, see Action Survivor. For costumed heroes without superpowers in general, see Non-Powered Costumed Hero. Anyone from a Witch Species who can't be defined as a Muggle Born of Mages is disqualified."
t01722,BadBoss,"An Evil Overlord, Diabolical Mastermind, Corrupt Corporate Executive, or other villain or Jerkass character establishes just how bad they are by callously mistreating their own henchmen, sometimes outright maiming or killing them — not just for failures that weren't their fault, but simply because somebody blew their nose too noisily; or to remind them who's the biggest, baddest son-of-a-bitch there; or because they were in a bad mood; or in many cases, absolutely no reason whatsoever beyond exercising dominance and/or entertaining themselves.
Why anyone goes on working for them is unknown. Their behavior sometimes breeds usurpers and/or annoys/scares off their mooks into joining the winning (or at least less dangerous) side, but sometimes it has no effect... and sometimes you're left wondering why anyone would work for them in the first place. They may have simply Signed Up for the Dental, though often it's just that they are even more terrified of what the boss would do to them if they dared to quit. Of course, this may be one reason why villains don't win nearly as often as heroes do; after all, a company/boss that mistreats their employees doesn't tend to be as successful as one that respects them.
Never ever ever try With Due Respect on a Bad Boss — many of them do not take criticism well, if at all.
The Weasel Co-Worker has an unusually high chance of getting away with his lies under him, which may be why he works for him.
In some cases it's not the Big Bad, but a more vague force of evil that slaughters its own. For those cases see Artifact of Death.

Not related to That One Boss, or to any other Boss Battle trope. Contrast with Benevolent Boss and Mean Boss."
t01727,BadDreams,"At some point in the past, Bob The Hero got hurt. Badly hurt. He suffered some horrible injury. He saw people he loved being brutalized or murdered. He had to Shoot the Dog and has been living with the guilt ever since. Maybe it was even all of the above.
But Bob doesn't want anyone else to know he's still hurting; not him, not Bob The Stoic. He won't even say Don't You Dare Pity Me!; he would if anyone showed him pity, but his pain is too well concealed for that. He won't even suffer a Not So Stoic moment or brush off the tears that come in a rare unguarded moment with ""There's Sand In My Eyes.""
So how do you show the readers (and sometimes the other characters) that Bob's impassive demeanor is the result of superhuman control and iron will, not a sociopath's Lack of Empathy? How do you show his breaking heart without Character Derailment? Or inappropriate Character Development for the story?
You give him Bad Dreams.
There are various options:
The instant Bob wakes (often by bolting upright in bed), he will be back to normal. However, dread of more nightmares makes him likely to become The Insomniac, which can prove dangerous if these are Recurring Dreams. If he woke everyone else up with his screaming, he will apologize for disturbing them. Usually. But he also usually won't tell them what made him scream. If he has superpowers then they may spark and fly about as he tosses restlessly, unable to control them as they activate in his fevered state. (Every once in a while this vulnerable moment opens the door for Bob to tell someone else about his trauma; this can be unrealistically beneficial.) If Bob also suffers from Go Mad from the Isolation, he will often not be able to remember that he is safe until several moments after waking.
If they stemmed from My Greatest Failure, Bad Dreams may overlap with Anxiety Dreams, and be fixed with it if Bob tackles the problem the second time round.
Visions about bad things, whether past, present, or future, or plain old ordinary dreams that are just unpleasant, are not Bad Dreams; Bad Dreams indicate that Bob is a traumatized character even though he is doing his damndest to hide that fact. (And nightmares from trauma can indeed be Truth in Television.)
Being the outward sign of an inward pain, Bad Dreams are obviously more likely for characters who keep their feelings on the inside: the Stoic, the Emotionless Girl, Broken Bird, and the like (whether Bob hides his pain from everyone or just from one particular person). But they can be a useful tool for demonstrating trauma for — and humanizing — anyone, since you can't control your dreams. May be used to reveal the true character of No Hero to His Valet (type 2). Or demonstrate that Being Evil Sucks. Or to show that The Alcoholic is Drowning My Sorrows. The Captain is prone to Bad Dreams because they cannot show weakness in front of their people and feels responsible for any injury or death that befalls those in their care.
Your Worst Nightmare may be mistaken for Bad Dreams. When the character suffers from Trauma-Induced Amnesia, they can overlap with Dreaming the Truth. When the dreams are symbolic, they can not always be distinguished; dreams of a villain could be remembering the past encounters, or foreshadowing future ones. The character may not be able to tell that someone is communicating because the means are bringing up memories. May be a Fever Dream Episode. Contrast Dreaming of Things to Come and Talking in Your Dreams.
These are often Recurring Dreams, at least by implication. May be caused by buried memories from Alternate Identity Amnesia.
Supertrope of Flashback Nightmare, which shows the nightmare in the form of a flashback.
Not to be confused with the Bad Dream series."
t01795,BalefulPolymorph,"A character gets hit with a spell, Curse, or Transformation Ray, causing an instantaneous and involuntary transformation into a form that is harmless or otherwise seriously impairs their ability to pursue their goals, until they can revert to their usual form by some means. This is commonly some sort of animal creature (whether real or fantastic), though it can also be a plant or a lifeless object. They may or may not lose their voice, or even their mental faculties (in which case someone else will have to seek the cure for them).
Frogs, newts, and toads are so common that they have their own subtrope, Bewitched Amphibians. Other common choices include mice, chickens, pigs, and sheep.
In role-playing or video games, this is frequently a Standard Status Effect that will disable or greatly weaken most attacks and magic, but will rarely affect the victim's Hit Points or armor. People may get turned into toads, but — hot damn — those toads will be Made of Iron! A notable exception is when insects are involved, in which case the victim is not long for this world.
This is common in fiction, as it's a way for a spellcaster to defeat a foe with magic without simply killing them, or as a form of punishment (e.g. underlings who failed their boss one time too many). It's also generally less permanent and more palatable than actual death. Often requires a hero to find the magic ""cure"" to turn his friend back into a person. This can be also be used to show a specific aspect of the character's personality, such as gluttons turned into pigs, or cowards into chickens.
Occasionally, this may function as a Transferred Transformation; in such cases, one character stuck in an undesirable form can only break the curse by shunting it onto someone else.
Occasionally in fiction a character may manage to save the day while still under this effect, sometimes through use of the animal form's abilities. This will lead to the Aesop that it's brains, not strength, that's important. Or that courage is more important than size. Or that you can lay an egg and still feel like a man.
If the transformation is presented to disturb and frighten the viewer, it becomes Transformation Horror. It will then probably be a Painful Transformation.
Whether or not a Baleful Polymorph is effective against a Voluntary Shapeshifter varies, depending on whether or not it also imposes a Shapeshifter Mode Lock — otherwise the shapeshifter can just transform themselves back to normal, or at least something else. Thus, it is a subtrope of curses.
Depending on the method, clothing may be transformed as well, or it may not, resulting in Shapeshifting Excludes Clothing if the characters or audience are aware of this fact, or Empty Piles of Clothing if they are not. (In either case, naturally, when they get turned back they're going to need those clothes back...)
Polymorphing into a nonliving form is much less likely to be played for laughs and much more likely to be permanent.
Can be used as a Karmic Transformation. Characters transformed this way may also exhibit Morphic Resonance. See also Emergency Transformation, Shape Shifter Mashup and Beauty to Beast. Compare Taken for Granite (turning into a statue), Unwilling Roboticisation (turning from flesh into something mechanical). Contrast with Hybrid Overkill Avoidance, where the subject is immune to further polymorphing because they're already supernatural. Compare Involuntary Shapeshifter."
t01885,BashBrothers,"Think about your closest friends. If you know them well enough, you also know their strengths and weaknesses. You know how they think, how they react, how they tick. You trust them to know the same about you, too. You might even trust them enough to let them fix your car—but not drive it. Hell would freeze over before you let them drive it.
In action oriented stories, two characters who are friends will work with each other during combat. Often this will present the image of Back-to-Back Badasses. If one person is big and the other short, the big guy will use brute strength and the short guy will use finesse. Maybe the big guy will clasp hands with the short guy and fling him around as though he was a weapon. Or the big guy will use the short guy as a projectile.
No matter what, they will fight in tandem. They will watch each other's back. There is something genuinely satisfying about watching the heroes take out a room full of bad guys by working together.
Characters who tend to do this are The Hero and The Lancer because they are foils to each other and so their fighting style complements the other. Even a mismatched Action Duo can be Bash Brothers with enough bonding/training.
It is not uncommon in certain stories to have two separate badasses who come together, spend some time trying to kill each other only to eventually turn their skills onto the hapless enemy who happens to piss them both off.
If the ""brothers"" are actually related by blood, it's a Sibling Team. A combative inversion is Fearful Symmetry. In a fantasy setting, they might be a Sword and Sorcerer. Not to be confused with the Smash Brothers who are, well, Super. The romantic version is the Battle Couple. And finally, a female duo may overlap with Lovely Angels.
Compare Tag Team, Red Oni, Blue Oni, Moveset Clone, and Sword and Sorcerer.
The name comes from the world of sports, where it refers to a pair of great players who end up on the same team. The first use of the term was in Baseball, where Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire formed a dangerous duo for the late-1980s-early-1990s Oakland A's on account of their incredible (and, as it turned out, steroid-fueled) power hitting. It has since spread to other players and sports. And yes, this trope happens with female fighting duos as well, in which case we refer to them as Smash Sisters."
t01914,BatmanGambit,"A plan that revolves entirely around people doing exactly what you'd expect them to do. This trope relies heavily on Flaw Exploitation manipulating, although it can work with virtues instead of ""flaws"" just as easily. Sometimes the flaw is that the villains are so predictable that they'll take the first chance they have to do something mean and underhanded. Other times, the flaw is that the heroes are so heroic that they'll act for the greater good without even thinking about it. A particularly Genre Savvy person will recognize the fact that heroes always win—and design a plan based on the assumption that they will succeed.
Provided that a character is smart enough and manipulative enough, they can get the people around them to do just about anything. Sometimes this can be accomplished by the power of charisma, but other times it needs to be perpetrated through an elaborate scheme. This scheme takes into account everything that The Chessmaster (as well as the viewer) knows about the characters being manipulated, and uses it against them. The patsies in this scheme only act and respond as their own predictability dictates and all the pieces fall into place.
The key difference between the Xanatos Gambit and the Batman Gambit is that while the former is structured so that any reasonable outcome will work to the advantage of the gambit instigator (and is thus ""foolproof""), the Batman Gambit does have a failure condition. Indeed, this failure condition will often be quite obvious and foreseeable to the audience, who have the benefit of perspective and objectivity: The failure condition in a Batman Gambit relies on someone acting out of character—or at least how the planner perceives their character. Consequently, Batman Gambits are only as successful as their planner is knowledgeable and insightful about those involved.
In short, if there is any reasonable action the pawns could take that would ruin the entire scheme, then it's a Batman Gambit. Because of this, a truly cunning planner will bluff their pawns into believing they have no options in the first place, and the pawns' best hope may be to realize that they have an opportunity to Take a Third Option.
Named after Batman, a character known as the World's Greatest Detective, who through careful analysis can often predict his foes' actions to psychic-like accuracy.
See also Manipulative Bastard, for the character most likely to attempt/pull these off; Unwitting Pawn, for the people who unwittingly help the Gambit along, and Spanner in the Works/Unwitting Instigator of Doom, for the people who unintentionally send it spinning into disaster. Can sometimes fail if the victim is Too Dumb to Fool. Also see Evil Cannot Comprehend Good for a common reason why villainous attempts fail.
Contrast with the MacGuffin Delivery Service. A failed attempt sometimes results in Springtime for Hitler. Also see Indy Ploy for the lack of a plan. A gambit that relies on the victim knowing he's being ""played"" but not knowing how is a Kansas City Shuffle. If things do go wrong, but the person keeps adjusting things so that Plan A works anyway, he's playing Xanatos Speed Chess. The Tape Knew You Would Say That is a subtrope.
Not an Amalgam Universe character. Also not a Slash Fic involving Batman or Gambit.
Warning: Spoilers"
t02003,BeautifulSlaveGirl,"Go-Go Enslavement and Bathe Her and Bring Her to Me both are based on the idea that enslaving a beautiful person is exciting. It's about dominance and power being combined with sex which turns some people on.
A girl who is born a slave and then grows up to become beautiful is instead about the contrast between her beauty and her circumstances. ""A lily among the weeds"".
This trope has an obvious dark side. Many of these girls are So Beautiful, It's a Curse, forced into wearing revealing clothing and often raped by their masters. Because of this, it's more likely to be the setup to a Rescue Romance. There is also more likely to be emphasis on the girl's purity as well, and the idea that goodness and beauty can be found anywhere, not just in prosperity.
Far too common in Real Life throughout millennia wherever chattel slavery existed.
Only beautiful slave girls that are born slaves or enslaved before puberty should be listed as examples. Post-puberty examples can go into Made a Slave. Often overlaps with Sex Slave. Often represents the highest-value goods in the Slave Market."
t02007,BeautyEqualsGoodness,"If a character is beautiful, then that character is a good person, either publicly or secretly. If a character is good, then that character will either be beautiful or be treated as beautiful.
Or to put it another way, every hero worth his salt must be physically attractive, or at the very least, better-looking than half of other people his or her age. This standard is more relaxed for side characters who can be truly ordinary-looking or even literal aliens, but expect the lead character to be pleasing to look at, even if he is the alien.
It almost goes without saying that this is very old; Ancient Greece codified it with the concept of ""cosmos"" (from which we get the term cosmetics), and an attempt was even made in the 19th Century to quantify this attitude into the ""science"" of physiognomy, which posited a direct correlation between appearance and moral character.
This trope's influence is felt on many others:
The failed subversion of Suetiful All Along is common.
For animals and more nonhuman characters, see What Measure Is a Non-Cute?.
Compare Evil Makes You Ugly. The opposite of this trope is Beauty Is Bad and Evil Is Sexy, although they aren't mutually exclusive with this one. Ugly Hero, Good-Looking Villain is a specific inversion. Contrast Divinely Appearing Demons and Face of an Angel, Mind of a Demon. See also Expecting Someone Taller.
As this trope is ubiquitous, please only add egregious cases. Invoked and defied examples are the best ones."
t02017,BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor,"...because you just might get it.
A character makes a wish and actually gets what they wished for, only to find that the reality does not live up to their fantasy.
This trope is all about how a character who makes a wish comes to regret it; the actual circumstances vary. The wisher may or may not have known that their wish was actually going to be heard. The one which grants it may be anything from a wish-granting Genie who wants to show the character the error of their ways to a Jackass Genie who just wants them to suffer. A sudden appearance by Louis Cypher, ready to offer a Deal with the Devil, is not out of the question either. Sometimes the character gets a tour through an Alternate Timeline. Other times the mechanism of the granted wish is not even explained—the wisher gets what they want through nothing more than an ironic and coincidental twist of circumstances.
The ""deal breaker"" that makes the wish not worth it also comes in a lot of possible flavors. Perhaps the character finds out that what they wanted comes at the cost of something they wanted even more. Maybe the element of their life that they wanted gone is really essential to who they are; maybe the wish isn't all they thought it was cracked up to be; or maybe it just comes true in an unanticipated manner.
In many cases the character repents of their ill-considered wish and things revert to normal, though in some stories the character is stuck in the new situation and forced to deal with the consequences of their thoughtless wish.
This is an elementary form of deconstruction — The character wants X, and then they find out that X has unforeseen consequences or is less satisfying than expected. Nine times of ten this is an outright Aesop, though strictly speaking it doesn't have to be. A crucial element of playing that angle well is making the ""deal breaker"" a meaningful, inherent flaw to the original wish rather than something tacked on or that could have easily turned out differently if the character had more common sense. Otherwise, a Broken Aesop is guaranteed.
Often a cause of Blessed with Suck, though not the only one; wont to count as an Opinion-Changing Dream; Contains the same type of irony as Ironic Hell. In some cases the experience may lead the wisher to discover an Awful Truth.
Sub-Trope of Be Careful What You Say. Super-Trope of It's a Wonderful Plot, I Wish It Were Real, I Wished You Were Dead, Please Dump Me, and Rhetorical Request Blunder. Often overlaps with Full-Circle Revolution — ""So you want new leadership? Meet the New Boss, same as the old boss.""
Compare Gone Horribly Right, when science or logic is involved rather than wishes, Wanting Is Better Than Having, when getting your wish ends with more disappointment than satisfaction, and Tempting Fate, which does not specifically require a wish.
Contrast the Literal Genie, which ignores the intent of the wish in favor of the exact words; this trope is about the complications that arise when you get exactly what you wanted, rather than exactly what you said. A Jackass Genie is likely to cause this to happen, if they don't just twist your words entirely. The Benevolent Genie, too, may make this happen if they think you ""need"" to learn the lesson from getting your wish, or if they lack the common sense or human perspective to see that the wish is disastrous, or if they're just constrained to grant the wish no matter how disastrous it is."
t02052,BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy,"The ""revelation"" that a famous historical figure actually had a secret life far more fantastic (figuratively or literally) and/or magical than history records. A historical retcon, if you will. Artists and writers tend to be the most common examples, followed by American Presidents. (At times, per the Men in Black II example below, a current figure also can be a subject of this trope, as can groups, per the National Treasure and Transformers examples below.)
This is sometimes a way for a show to capitalize on sudden popular interest in some historical figure, or just to exercise a writer's pet interest.
In such a story, Plausible Deniability is almost always the order of the day; we have to be given this fantastic secret history in such a way that we can believe that the fantastic elements were kept out of public record.
In Time Travel stories, this often involves Retroactive Precognition, and one possible form it can take is You Will Be Beethoven.
Ancient Astronauts does this for entire ancient civilizations.
While the mixing of fantastic elements into historical texts is as old as mankind (see the Arthurian cycle for one example), the modern form of this trope probably originates with Dracula, essentially the incorporation of a fantastic secret life into the history of Vlad the Impaler.
This trope can very effectively add an air of mystique to otherwise familiar historical material and personages, but it can become distracting if overused, to say nothing of the unpleasant implications of having everyone remotely skilled at anything in history be nonhuman or relying on superhuman powers.
See also Julius Beethoven da Vinci and, for a few particularly popular alien spies, see Elvis Has Left the Planet, Rasputin the Mad Monk, and — in Japanese media — Demon King Nobunaga. We Didn't Start the Führer is a subtrope of this. For a specific Biopic example, check out Biography à Clef. Often it leads to a Historical Badass Upgrade. May involve Gender Flipping, in which case expect a Samus Is a Girl reaction (or ""Samus Is a Guy"", if ""Samus"" was originally a girl in the first place) when the character's true identity is revealed. Contrast No Such Thing as Wizard Jesus. Also the Been There, Shaped History character where they simply use a fictional character. If the alien spy initially appears to be a fictional character, and only late in the story is revealed to be a historical figure, it's a Historical Person Punchline. Also compare Real Event, Fictional Cause (with real events instead of people)."
t02086,BelligerentSexualTension,"There's a couple, usually a sometimes sweet, sometimes grouchy female paired with a secretly-kind jerk, who are not able to admit their feelings. At the top of their lungs.
Despite the conflict, there is an attraction. This is usually obvious to everyone around except the couple. Confront them with the obvious, they'll deny deny deny. Sometimes they will progress to admitting their friendship but insist they are Just Friends. Eventually, they can admit their feelings to practically anyone except their loved one. It ends up where both characters dance around admitting their feelings as if the words ""I love you"" are some sort of death curse, much to the frustration of the audience and the other characters.
Older Than Steam, since this is used in Much Ado About Nothing, and has varying degrees of popularity at different times.
If there is a Love Epiphany with one of these characters, expect it to change nothing, at least in the short term.
This can even be true in established long-term relationships; see Like an Old Married Couple. If the whole relationship is defined by the belligerence, it can become The Masochism Tango. If a pair of outright enemies has this sort of attraction, it's a case of Foe Romance Subtext and when it ultimately goes from subtext to text, then it's Dating Catwoman. See also Slap-Slap-Kiss, No Accounting for Taste, Well, Excuse Me, Princess! and Defrosting Ice Queen. If we're lucky, at the end we may get to see a moment of Aw, Look! They Really Do Love Each Other.
Expect this couple to be either extremely popular or completely hated by the fandom. For the platonic version, compare Vitriolic Best Buds and With Friends Like These.... Not to be confused with Hate at First Sight, although it may overlap."
t02114,BerserkButton,"Some characters always get enraged when given a certain, minor trigger.
Say you're dealing with a character who seems perfectly normal. They're a nice person; friendly, sociable, and well-adjusted, saving stray kittens and helping old ladies cross the street on the way to their day job of working at a soup kitchen. But then you make a mistake. You happen to mention in passing what you think is a fairly innocuous observation, maybe pointing out that they could stand to lose a little weight, or is a little on the short side, or maybe could use a girlfriend or boyfriend, or you do something that you think is no big deal in their presence, like question Who Names Their Kid ""Dude""?. And the character instantly goes ballistic, flying into a screaming, frothing, sometimes tearful Unstoppable Rage, from which you will be lucky to escape with your life.
You have just pressed their Berserk Button.
The Berserk Button is one type of Trigger, where the response to a minor or generally insignificant thing is one of extreme anger. That is, engaging the trigger turns an ordinary character into The Berserker.
In comedic works, the Berserk Button tends to be a physical feature that the character is insecure or in denial about, like their height. Animals don't seem to like having their species misidentified. Comedic Berserk Buttons are often used to make an otherwise unflappable character lose their cool and go off on a hilarious rant. In cartoons, you can usually tell when a Berserk Button has been hit when the character who has it turns bright red and steam starts shooting out their ears. Dramatic Berserk Buttons tend to be reserved for things that strike a bit too Close to Home for a character.
If a person seems to get angry over anything and everything, they have a Hair-Trigger Temper. For the negative effects of hitting the Berserk Button, see You Wouldn't Like Me When I'm Angry. For the trope's opposite, see Kindness Button. See also Trauma Button and Misery Trigger. Compare and contrast Rant-Inducing Slight and Rage Breaking Point, where it's a series of events that disables them from holding back anymore. If a person gets angry that other people aren't taking a (very unimportant) thing seriously, see Serious Business.
For other related tropes, see Anger Tropes, Protective Tropes, Obsession Tropes and Prejudice Tropes.
This is not about anger in response to something that would reasonably enrage someone. Extreme reactions to minor provocations may still qualify, however. Also, this doesn't apply if the worst that happens is if the character scowls or frowns at the provocation."
t02154,BettyAndVeronica,"One of the most common types of Love Triangle, named after characters from Archie Comics, wherein the main character (""Archie"") is caught between two love interests with drastically different personalities. ""Betty"" is the sweet, reliable, everyday Girl Next Door type (which could mean ""kind of dull""), while ""Veronica"" is more alluring, exotic, and edgy, but has more of a mischievous or icy personality (which could mean ""kind of a bitch""). This translates to their physical appearances; Betty will be pretty but modest in dress, while Veronica will be Ms. Fanservice in all her glory. As a rule, they will have different hair colors as per the Blonde, Brunette, Redhead trope.
This trope is almost endlessly flexible. In a commonly-seen version, Betty is Archie's loyal comrade and usually his best friend, secretly pining for him while he (unaware of her feelings) is attracted only to Veronica, the sultry Ms. Unattainable who barely notices him. Betty, who wants Archie to be happy, may assist him in his pursuit of Veronica, even though we all know how much she wants him for herself. Another possibility is that Archie and Betty are already in a relationship, but then Veronica starts batting her eyelashes at Archie and causes friction between the couple. In cases of Arranged Marriage, Betty is the girl the parents prefer and Veronica is the one they reject, especially if children are expected (because Betty is more likely to want them). When Archie meets Betty and Veronica at the same time — if they are sisters, for example — he will fall in Love at First Sight with Veronica and only notice Betty after she had time to grow on him (as, for instance, when he often comes to their parents' to try to woo Veronica).
""Archie,"" ""Betty,"" and ""Veronica"" can be any gender or orientation, though The Gentleman or the Scoundrel is a possible Spear Counterpart specific to the situation of a female Archie and two male suitors. Another variant is Rich Suitor, Poor Suitor, with a rich but douchey ""Veronica"" and a poor but kindhearted ""Betty"", or a rich and kind but boring ""Betty"" and a spirited blue-collar ""Veronica."" Apparently you can only have money or the girl, fellas.
Whom the hero will end up with varies according to medium, story, and the values of the time period and culture where the story was made. Traditionally, Betty stood a better chance, at least if the story had a Happy Ending, due to conforming to social standards, while choosing Veronica would only lead the poor sap into ruin. Usually, the hero would spend the story chasing Veronica only to realize that Betty was The One — complete with a convenient ""appreciate what you've got"" or True Beauty Is on the Inside Aesop. (In extreme but fairly frequent cases, he would learn that Veronica was in fact his illegitimate half-sister.) A Proud Beauty Veronica would often discover that she had set her standards too high, or overestimated how long her beauty would last, and find herself an Old Maid.
However, as the perception of ""appropriate"" sexual conduct has changed over time, it's more common for Veronica to have a happy ending too, if not with the main hero, then as part of a Beta Couple. Movies have traditionally favored Betty, but video games, comics, and TV shows (especially long runners) have played this trope for all its worth. When Archie is female, a more enticing but risky Veronica usually has the edge over a sweet but boring Betty, especially if the story is aimed at women, and if Veronica loses, you can bet the fanfic writers will race to fix that.
In case this wasn't complicated enough, sometimes a Third-Option Love Interest makes their presence known to shake things up even further. Look up Cock Fight for the almost-literal *ahem* Spear Counterpart.
Movies have lately come to a compromise with the Manic Pixie Dream Girl; cute and non-threatening, yet exciting and different. Video games with Multiple Endings get to Take a Third Option by letting the player choose who the hero ends up with. Comic book and TV show franchises tend to have Negative Continuity over the long term due to constantly rebooting their origins to avoid Continuity Lockout.
Compare the admirable one and sexy one of the Four-Girl Ensemble as well as the wife and seductress of The Three Faces of Eve. Betty might be the Light Feminine while Veronica is the Dark Feminine in Light Feminine and Dark Feminine.
Do be aware that fans like to exaggerate potential relationships; Shipping would not exist without it. As a result there are likely to be multiple instances of an Official Couple (vindicated by Word of God) that has some sort of Fanon-based ""romantic rival"" mirroring this trope. Even shows without such romantic entanglements in-universe can inspire Betty/Veronica debates amongst the Fandom; hence, Mary Ann/Ginger, Bailey/Jennifer, Janet/Chrissy, Velma/Daphne, etc.
In a very small number of these scenarios, particularly in more recent times or exotic settings, the conflict may be resolved by the triangle becoming a One True Threesome or a Marry Them All ending. This is particularly prevalent in fan works.
See also Betty and Veronica Switch, where the presumed Betty and Veronica somehow switch roles.
Please avoid referring to characters as ""the Betty"" and ""the Veronica"" to someone else's ""Archie"" when referring to this trope, as it is not particularly helpful to those tropers who are not familiar enough with the characters in question to immediately extrapolate the implied relationships."
t02164,BewareTheNiceOnes,"Sometimes, trying to Break the Cutie has consequences. Sometimes, the nicest person in the story gets pushed to the limit of what they can take... and the results are not pretty.
The sweeter, gentler, more polite, more peaceful, and overall nicer a character is, the worse it will be for whomever is in the vicinity when they're subject to one round too many of Break the Cutie, or Dude, Where's My Respect?, a Rant-Inducing Slight, or hitting their Berserk Button or Rage Breaking Point. What was once a sweet and nice individual suddenly snaps and becomes something far worse than the Big Bad could have expected.
Think it's called Unstoppable Rage for nothing?
Although any Nice One can make you wish you were never born, there are certain tropes which act as a sort of force multiplier. Check any of the following tropes to see just what is most likely in store for whomever set off the Nice One: Badass Adorable, Death Glare (which should never be brushed off), Mama Bear (or Team Mom, or Papa Wolf, depending), The Quiet One, The So-Called Coward, Teach Him Anger (a suicidal idea with the Gentle Giant), and Tranquil Fury. Especially bad when dealing with a Technical Pacifist, and even worse when dealing with an Actual Pacifist (for whom this is not an unusual trait). Combine all at once and there may not be a minimum safe distance to escape their wrath.
More Truth in Television than you think - deferring gratification with regards to expressing one's anger tends to make the end result... less than pretty. Also, it's generally more frightening when a more mellow person starts acting up because it's so unexpected. Even when it's not scary, it can make a character feel great shame, as it's when they realize they were such a Jerkass, even the nicest person they know couldn't deal with their shit anymore.
Cultures that have a reputation for being polite, non-confrontational, and passive-aggressive usually have a history of being very warlike in the past; think Scandinavia, Canada, England, or Japan. These cultures developed polite, non-confrontational, passive-aggressive characteristics to keep from killing one another off; push them too far, however, and they can and will remember their heritage.
See also Good Is Not Soft, when a normally affable character realizes that nice won't always get things done in a situation. They can coincide, if the realization and the outrage are triggered at the same time. An Actual Pacifist subjected to the same stresses will turn into a Badass Pacifist instead (unless this becomes a Wham Episode in which pacifism is renounced.) The results are quite similar if they Madden Into Misanthropy, the difference being the new misanthrope isn't so much a violent dynamo as a care free Jerkass.
This is not to be confused with a character being a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing (or even Face of an Angel, Mind of a Demon). While the latter trope's 'nice' image is usually just a facade for their genuinely callous personality, this trope involves a genuinely nice character submitting to a rare act of malice. Repeated subjection of a nice character to this trope, though, may result in Flanderizing them to such a degree that it's impossible to tell the difference.
Can also result from being repeatedly subjected to the losing end of the Misery Poker trope when their combined traumas far outweigh any single problem another character has because of feeling like a Butt-Monkey due to their very real and legitimate problems repeatedly being ignored.
The polar opposite of Is This What Anger Feels Like?.
Subtropes include Let's Get Dangerous!; Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass; Minored In Ass Kicking; The So-Called Coward; and Who's Laughing Now?.
Also compare Yandere, Cute and Psycho, Killer Rabbit, Did You Think I Can't Feel?, Badass Santa.
A This Means War! declaration may be delivered as a result of it. For a common aftermath of this trope, see Cruel Mercy.
Compare/contrast Knight Templar. Compare Beware the Quiet Ones if they are known for their silence more than their kindness. Compare Killer Rabbit for when you need to beware the cute ones. Compare Beware the Silly Ones when they're known for clowning around. Compare Silk Hiding Steel, for when you should beware the proper ones. May also act as an emotional power."
t02187,BigBad,"The cause of all bad happenings in a story. A Big Bad could be a character with Evil Plans or it could be an omnipresent situation, such as a comet heading towards the Earth. In a serial story, the Big Bad exerts an effect across a number of episodes, even an entire season.
This trope is not a catch-all term for the biggest, ugliest villain of any given story. In fact, it doesn't have to be a villain at all, as we just said. If it is a villain, though, it should be identified correctly; the badass leader of the outlaw gang that causes the most personal trouble is not the Big Bad. The railroad tycoon who is using the gang as muscle is the Big Bad. The Man Behind the Man is very common for this trope, leaving the reveal of the big bad as The Chessmaster behind it all and proving themselves far more clever and resourceful than the Villain of the Week. Sometimes the Big Bad is the grand enemy of an entire franchise as an Overarching Villain. At other times, the Big Bad is an Arc Villain who causes trouble for a period of time only to be replaced by another Big Bad.
When you look at a season-long story or a major Story Arc and you can identify one problem being the cause of everything, that is the Big Bad. In its most general form, a Big Bad will be at the center of the Myth Arc rather than just any Story Arc.
The term ""Big Bad"" was popularized in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It was characteristic of Buffy's Big Bads for their identity or nature, or even the fact that they are the Big Bad at all, to remain unclear for a considerable time. Occasionally, characters would even refer to themselves as ""the Big Bad"". Whether or not they were, though, this is a Big Bad Wannabe. The structure of Buffy placed the Big Bad as being crucial to the Half-Arc Season, half the episodes are filler dealing with unrelated enemies while the other half involved the ongoing Myth Arc with the Big Bad. Each season can easily be defined by who the Big Bad was.
If a show has a series of Big Bad jeopardies, they can function like a series of Monsters of the Week that take more than one week to finish off. If there is a Legion of Doom, you can expect the Big Bad to be involved somehow. They're probably sorted by power, with the strongest for last, following the Sorting Algorithm of Evil.
Evil Overlord, Diabolical Mastermind, The Chessmaster, Arch-Enemy, The Man Behind the Man, and often Manipulative Bastard are specific types of villains who are liable to show up as Big Bads. If they're a Magnificent Bastard or Hero Killer, the good guys are in big trouble. The heroic counterpart of this character is the Big Good, who will very often be the focus of this character's attention over The Hero at the beginning of a series. If a work of fiction is conspicuously lacking a Big Bad, it may be a case of No Antagonist.
See also Big Bad Duumvirate for two (or more) Big Bads working together. Sometimes a Big Bad will get their start as a servant to another villain — if that's the case, they're a Dragon Ascendant. If the character who fills the role of Big Bad in most meaningful ways is nominally subordinate to someone else (someone significantly less menacing by comparison), they are a Dragon-in-Chief. If the story has many Big Bads at once who don't work together, see Big-Bad Ensemble. The Big Bad Shuffle occurs when there are multiple candidates for the Big Bad position. If the Big Bad doesn't start out as bad but develops over the course of the story, it's Big Bad Slippage. If the Big Bad of one section of a work doesn't die on being defeated and stays around as a character in a different plot role (reformed or not), that's Ex-Big Bad.
The Big Bad of a story is not always the most powerful or oldest existing evil force. Perhaps an evil presence along the lines of an Eldritch Abomination overshadows the work's setting, but is mainly divorced from the story's events — that would be the Greater-Scope Villain.
It is one of the most well-known tropes on the TV Tropes community, being the first to have over forty thousand wicks, and is the most wicked trope. This is probably because it's incredibly common."
t02206,BigBrotherInstinct,"One very common way to establish that a male (or increasingly frequently female) character is a Nice Guy (even if the niceness is hidden under a gruff exterior) is to give them an instinctive desire to be a respectable big sibling to smaller or younger characters (in more cases female than male). These other characters may be truly younger siblings, or they may be completely unrelated, or even older, but the feeling is the same: to act as their protector.
The Big Brother Instinct serves to explain fan attraction to Moe tropes and devices as an emotional, rather than sexual, response. There seems to be something inherently comforting to an awkward male about being looked up to by a younger girl for support. Therefore, Moe can be wish fulfillment about taking a ""big brother role"" instead of about being a Love Interest. Rather amusingly, it's also quite often that the trope gets inverted, and the younger sibling wants to protect the older instead. Hilarity Ensues when both versions happen at the same time.
If both characters are male, the older (or in the case of twins, the physically stronger) brother will usually act as the younger/smaller brother's protector, to the point of treating him like a child, even when the younger brother is fully capable of protecting himself. This behavior can come across as loving and nurturing or as condescending and smothering. If the older brother goes to extreme, morally questionable lengths for the sake of the younger sibling, then they are a Knight Templar Big Brother.
Compare Mama Bear, Papa Wolf, Family Man, Extremely Protective Child, and Promotion to Parent. Compare/Contrast Big Brother Bully. While the two may seem mutually exclusive at first glance, they frequently overlap in both fiction and reality: the same sibling who makes their little sister's life a constant parade of pranks may have a If You Ever Do Anything to Hurt Her... conversation with her new boyfriend. Also, contrast with Disappointing Older Sibling when the character either lacks the Big Brother Instinct or is completely ineffectual at protecting the younger sibling.
Has nothing to do with the TV show Big Brother. The 1984 meaning of ""Big Brother"" is covered under Big Brother Is Watching."
t02215,BigDamnHeroes,"Any time the heroes/anti heroes get to save the day in a big, awesome manner.
For instance, say that the poor Damsel in Distress is looking her fate dead in the face, and is seemingly resigned to it, because it seems that Nothing Can Save Us Now… and then, boom! The heroes kick down the door and proceed to stomp the bad guys into the ground. Just in Time.
A Ragtag Bunch of Misfits will often have a Misfit Mobilization Moment before becoming the Big Damn Heroes. If they were busy with something else, but saw the crisis and dropped whatever they were doing in order to save the day, it's a case of Dudley Do-Right Stops to Help.
Note that a Big Damn Heroes moment doesn't have to succeed. They can fail to save the day, or even make things worse. These are all straight versions of the trope.
If the heroes just finished a training arc and show off new powers, it's Look What I Can Do Now!.
If this is done in an anticlimactic way, then it's a Deus ex Machina. When done right, it is a sure-fire way to get a Crowning Moment of Awesome, or why not, a Crowning Moment of Heartwarming. Sometimes a moment like this is used to introduce a heroic character.
A Super-Trope to Roaring Rampage of Rescue. The King in the Mountain always has a legend of becoming this.
A Sister Trope to Gunship Rescue, I Got You Covered, Horseback Heroism, Just in Time, or even Changed My Mind, Kid.
Compare The Cavalry (it's the heroes saved in the nick of time), Contrived Coincidence, Bad Guys Do the Dirty Work (otherwise known as Big Damn Villains), Villainous Rescue (when the villains are like this trope), ""Hell, Yes!"" Moment.
Contrast You Are Too Late, Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!, The Cavalry Arrives Late.

t02224,BigEater,"Characters (who may or may not be fat) that regularly eat enough for an entire football team, often devastating the whole table — and sometimes entire restaurants in their insatiable hunger. Often with a speed-eating technique that makes food seem to vanish spontaneously from the plate. Primarily a comedy trope, a common sight gag with these kinds of characters in cartoons or anime is having piles upon piles of plates and bowls stack up as the character chows down. Cut a Slice, Take the Rest is a common joke involving this type of character, as as I'll Take Two Beers Too.
Extreme Omnivores and people with eating related powers tend to be Big Eaters by default. Large characters, such as the Big Fun and Boisterous Bruiser, tend to be this trope. In fact, the Fat Comic Relief is almost always a Big Eater. However, Big Eaters who remain thin despite their habits are considered the best examples.
Don't interrupt a Big Eater's meal, or worse, try to steal his or her food, as this is a very good way to piss the character off...
Although it's often Played for Laughs, serious examples and deconstructions are known to exist. For example, a Big Eater may be suffering from bulimia or overindulging as a symptom of deeper emotional problems.
Characterization wise it can also be used to fulfill the needs of many Required Secondary Powers adding depth to a trait commonly dismissed as a comedic quirk and make a character's abilities more believable. Characters with a Healing Factor, Super Speed, or the ability to change shape and size, don't have to flout the laws of physics, they can simply explain that the extra mass and energy come from their over the top eating binges. Magic users in general can use this trope and say that they cast from their calories, which would explain why mages are often rather thin characters (though obese wizards aren't unheard of).
In action series, this is often a trait belonging to the Kid Hero, Boisterous Bruiser, or other types of high energy characters. Because many wild animals exhibit this in real life it's also a popular trait for Wild Child and Raised by Wolves characters.
In comics and manga it's become common to make a Comically Serious character or badass a Big Eater as a way to add a humorous quirk that doesn't take away from the character's seriousness. A common justification for a female big eater is that all the fat goes straight to her breasts. Consequently, female characters with big boobs are often big eaters. Occasionally they have Bizarre Taste in Food or are Obsessed with Food when not eating.
Truth in Television, though without proper exercise it can lead to obesity. People with higher metabolisms are better able to avoid weight problems caused by overeating and teenagers are known for being able to eat amounts of food that will make them fat if they continue to eat like that in their 20s and beyond. Vegetarians can come off as this - because vegetable matter doesn't contain a lot of calories. Most wild animals need to be this because they usually have no idea when or where their next meal will be, especially in harsh environments like deserts or the arctic.
See Extreme Omnivore for when someone doesn't limit themselves to things usually considered food. If two Big Eaters are pitted against each other it's an Eating Contest. For a villain that has this as their biggest vice (especially an obese villain), see Villainous Glutton. Players can invoke this trope in any video game where the characters have a Hyperactive Metabolism and eat food to heal their injuries. Characters who have this kind of metabolism paired with such an appetite often Never Gets Fat. Compare Really Fond of Sleeping, which has a similar attitude toward sleeping and also are themselves likely to be a Big Eater. Characters like this may have a Delicious Daydream or sing an Ode to Food."
t02242,BigGood,"Whereas the Big Bad is considered the ultimate evil to be defeated, the Big Good is the cornerstone of any heroic organization. This character is explicitly stated to be a counterpart to combat the forces of evil, likely calling all the shots in the organization and is normally the highest ranking or the absolute most powerful. Since The Hero is usually, but not always synonymous with the protagonist, the Big Good does not always fill that role, as it is usually more dramatic for the protagonist to work upwards from the bottom. It may be stated (at least in the beginning) that The Hero is expendable whereas this character is not. The Big Good is simply the most valuable member of the heroic movement in a given work, whether in terms of rank, function or wisdom. If not The Hero, then they will most definitely be the mentor to craft The Hero into being the weapon they need him to be.
Authority Equals Asskicking is in full force most of the time, with the Big Good usually starting off several orders of magnitude more powerful than The Hero. The character may be servant to a greater good just like their how evil counterpart could be a servant to a greater evil. Unlike the Big Bad, however, the Big Good can be taken down rather early — to show just how powerful the enemy has gotten by that point or as part of a greater plan. One of the more common ways this is done is to have the two Bigs confront each other directly, with the Big Good coming up short. For extra pathos, the Big Bad was once their second in command. Expect The Hero or some other member of the True Companions to take up the mantle by the time the Grand Finale comes round.
Might occasionally be a great hero who is believed to be dead (might be true, or they might be simply hidden) or someone who most characters think is just a myth until they appear in the flesh. At the beginning of a series, expect the Big Bad to be much more worried about this character than about The Hero. The Hero may not even register on any antagonist's radar while all of them will be out to off the Big Good. The Dragon is far more often The Rival or Worthy Opponent to The Hero than the Big Bad.
For Villain Protagonist wise, the Big Good is the biggest opposing force against them.
Do note that this trope is about a character role and as such there are multiple Heroic Archetypes that can fulfill this role, including but not limited to:
At its most general, the Big Good title simply refers to the leader of the largest group opposing the Big Bad. Keep this in mind when suggesting examples. See also Greater-Scope Paragon."
t02265,BigScrewedUpFamily,"This is the family with issues, from which many, many kinds of Freudian Excuse can be taken. It's often very wealthy and powerful, when it's not royalty, and has many traditions. They have secrets, skeletons in their cupboards (sometimes literally) and are overly proud of their long (and bloody) history. Abusive behaviors of some kind are almost certain to have occurred. While they may display affectionate behaviors as well, to them Cain and Abel is a way of life — though if you piss off one of them, the rest will instantly band together to destroy you.
They're very likely to feature at least one Magnificent Bastard, Evil Matriarch, Manipulative Bastard, ""Well Done, Son!"" Guy, Unfavorite or Black Sheep. There may be a Lady Drunk. While not frequent, Brother–Sister Incest and other kinds of canonical incest are most likely to be featured within this family. They also like to wage war with other families. Decadent Courts typically feature several of them. If they've been screwed up for a while, they're likely to have a Tangled Family Tree.
This family is often contrasted by the existence of a more traditional, if poorer, family, where everyone loves and supports each other despite occasional bickering.
A subtrope of The Clan. See also Royally Screwed Up, It Runs in the Family, Dysfunctional Family, and Dysfunction Junction. Contrast Thicker Than Water. May form a Super Family Team. If the family is screwed up in the narrative sense, because of complexity, Continuity Snarls and the like, see Tangled Family Tree instead."
t02282,BilingualBonus,"A hidden message in a foreign language. This ostensibly makes these messages available only to bilingual and international audiences. The extra can be anything from a plot-relevant point to additional dialogue (often used to demonstrate that they've Shown Their Work with the language) to a random gag. The opposite of As Long as It Sounds Foreign (where a foreign language is used carelessly on the hopes no one will notice and sounds ridiculous or implausible if a viewer can understand the tongue).
As you may have guessed, this can be a very clever way of Getting Crap Past the Radar. In fact, Hollywood censors once demanded English translations of any part of a screenplay written in a foreign language (whether that language was real or made-up) precisely to thwart this, since subtitles traditionally weren't used in American films even when a character was speaking a language other than English.
If the word still makes sense in another way then it's also a Multiple Reference Pun.
This, of course, not only applies to actual languages, but also the various fictional languages that have full-blown lexicons and can technically be translated — Quenya and Sindarin, Klingon, D'ni from the Myst verse, et cetera. Contrast Bilingual Backfire."
t02326,BitchInSheepsClothing,"You meet someone you think is a really Nice Guy/Girl, or perhaps you meet a favorite celebrity for the first time, thinking that they'll be just as warm-hearted and cool as they are on camera. However, something happens to show their true colors, revealing an immature brat, total Jerkass, or even outright villain.
Congratulations. You've just met the Bitch in Sheep's Clothing — the polar opposite of Hidden Heart of Gold.
The Wounded Gazelle Gambit is a favorite tactic of this sort of antagonist, and if they are genuinely evil, expect them to be a Villain with Good Publicity.
It's also worth mentioning that this trope isn't exclusive to female characters. The title is a play on ""A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,"" and can apply to any gender. All it requires is a person appears to be nice but is actually cruel and/or manipulative.
In romance plots, the Bitch in Sheep's Clothing is usually trying to date, dating, or about to marry another character, and is hiding their true colors. Occasionally, the Bitch in Sheep's Clothing genuinely was a nice person... but suffered sudden Character Derailment in order to remove their status as a love interest for another character. In any case, expect them to make an Engineered Public Confession in one form or another.
In some cases, however, a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing can be sympathetic. Many lighter cases involve a scenario in which a fairly flawed yet well-intentioned character make themselves out to be more benevolent than they really are (especially if they have a high opinion of themselves). More often than not, this charade falls apart and their true persona blasts out, usually in an extreme manner that makes them look even worse than they usually are. In some cases, a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing can lean more towards Jerk with a Heart of Gold if they aren't too busy hiding their unpleasant qualities with an over-enacted facade, instead of showing their genuine (and usually resented) redeeming aspects. Maybe someone will seem like this, then you realize they are just a type B Tsundere.
See also: Devil in Plain Sight, Villain with Good Publicity, Warts and All and False Innocence Trick. The Fake Cutie is a subtrope where the (usually young) bitch tries to invoke cuteness or childlike innocence. The Troublemaking New Pet is a related trope where someone takes in a new pet, only to learn that the pet is a huge troublemaker or outright evil and gets rid of it afterward once discovered. A Romantic False Lead is often like this. The Enfant Terrible is also a related trope (possibly the Annoying Younger Sibling with Sibling Rivalry from Hell). For a version specifically concerning actors and actresses, see Nice Character, Mean Actor. For a more extreme version of this trope, see Bait the Dog, where the 'bitch', oddly enough, likes to Kick the Dog.
Not to be confused either with Affably Evil or Beware the Nice Ones, where the person is genuinely nice rather than just putting up a facade (though both tropes can be derailed as such if overexaggerated, as can a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing evolve into one of the former via Character Development). Overlaps with Faux Affably Evil when the character keeps the polite and friendly attitude while about to do something horrible to someone else even when the other character knows it. Contrast With Took a Level in Jerkass, where the character was genuinely nice and became... well a Jerkass. Also compare and contrast Jerk with a Heart of Jerk. Compare Jerkass to One if they are nice to everyone but horrible to one particular person.
Contrast Bitch Alert for a bitch who lets everyone knows that she's one. Subtrope of A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing. Contrast also with Sheep in Sheep's Clothing for a character believed to be a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing and eventually subverted."
t02330,BiTheWay,"Characters who just happen to be bisexual. ""Outing"" a bisexual can be convoluted. Some pass for straight or gay or allow others to make their own assumptions. As a result, a het-seeming bisexual reads as Straight Gay, whereas a bisexual that acts Camp Gay is likely to be seen as subverting the stereotypes associated with a camp persona. Bisexuals are not portrayed so much for their mannerisms as their supposed habits. Actual bisexual stereotypes are generally limited to glam rockers, hippies, swingers and other flamboyant presentations of alternative sexuality. So in the end, it's likely that Bob or Alice Bisexual will be outed in passing.
Compare If It's You, It's Okay, where someone who has shown interest in people of the opposite sex in the past has one exception. Contrast Depraved Bisexual, where bisexuality is used as a way to make the character seem more evil (or conversely, being bisexual makes you evil), and Anything That Moves, where bisexuality is treated as a lack of discrimination in partners (in real life the two are not necessarily linked; just as straight and gay people don't find everyone of their preferred sex attractive, bisexual people don't find ""everyone"" attractive). Contrast Suddenly Sexuality, where a character skips from gay to straight or vice versa with no warning, and No Bisexuals, where the characters/narrative don't consider bisexuality as an option.
Compare Ambiguously Bi, where things are more, well, ambiguous. The most likely bisexual archetype to lead to But Not Too Bi. Compare and contrast Everyone Is Bi, where either this trope is in effect for the majority of the cast or sexuality is simply presented as a non-issue. See Kinsey Scale of Tropes for more about bisexuality tropes."
t02336,BittersweetEnding,"Victory, at last! The Big Bad has finally been vanquished, the day has been saved, all the damsels in distress and innocent bystanders have been rescued and the heroes are ready to reap their reward, kiss their Love Interests and walk away toward the setting sun...
...victory, really? Then why does no one feel like cheering? Why is the atmosphere so heavy with melancholy? Why do you find yourself counting your losses as well as your gains?
Somewhere between the Happily Ever After and the Downer Ending, the Bittersweet Ending happens when victory came at a harsh price, when, for whatever reason, the heroes cannot fully enjoy the reward of their actions, when some irrevocable loss has happened during the course of the events, and nothing will ever be the same again. A Bittersweet Ending is still ending on a high note, but one that is mixed with sadness and nostalgia. Often, such endings are the result of the plot making a completely happy ending impossible. (Looked at objectively, some Happy Endings have more things lost or irrevocably broken than some Bittersweet Endings. This trope relies more on the mood than on such objective weighing of matters.)
Some specific cases of Bittersweet Endings are:
Bittersweet Endings can fall on either end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism. They come up frequently in High Fantasy, for obvious reasons — an epic that ends with the hero triumphing over the ultimate Big Bad and bringing peace and prosperity to the land, but at the same time defeating the ultimate Big Bad does not always come without sacrifices, whether be most or all of the characters dying in the end or the characters are at a loss about what to do now. Sometimes these are worlds and stories where you can Earn Your Happy Ending, though it won't be Exactly What It Says on the Tin.
Also shows where too many romantic interests are introduced for one hero are doomed to end in this way or with No Romantic Resolution, since painless resolution is mostly impossible.
Sometimes the story's Aesop requires a bittersweet ending in order to be effective. For certain issues, this is the only way to get the point across without the effect being undermined by other tropes such as the Everybody Laughs Ending.
In short, if the characters are worse off than when they started, it's a Downer Ending. If they're better off (or at least status quo is preserved), but the work still ends on a melancholy note, it's a Bittersweet Ending. Another way to think of it is that if the story's main conflict is resolved in favor of the protagonists, but at great sacrifice, it's a Bittersweet Ending. A Downer Ending requires the heroes to fail, and the conflict resolving with nothing good happening in the end, if it's even resolved at all.
Prone to Meaningful Funerals, Wartime Weddings, and To Absent Friends, and having Babies Ever After and Someone to Remember Him By result in Dead Guy Junior.
Compare with Pyrrhic Victory, where the day is carried, but the cost of winning is crippling to the victors.
Compare and contrast with Ray of Hope Ending, where the villain prevails but not all is lost. Also with Esoteric Happy Ending, where the author clearly meant it to be joyful, beautiful and uplifting... but the readers don't see it that way.
Note that as an ending trope, the following entries are riddled with unmarked spoilers.

t02455,BlessedWithSuck,"One way or the other, something you think is going to be useful turns out to be worthless.
Blessed with Suck is one of those tropes that comes in a few distinct flavors. Generally, it's when a character is given a special ability that seems to cause nothing but trouble:
This blessing may take the form of Applied Phlebotinum, privileges, or special abilities. For artistic cases (real or (self-) imagined), see Muse Abuse.
May be caused by a Literal Genie. May also result in With Great Power Comes Great Insanity either as part of the blessing or a result of its psychological effects.
Opposite side of the same coin from Cursed with Awesome, in which a ""curse"" actually is cool and helps the character, even if they refuse to believe it and just want to be normal. If the ""blessing"" is somehow removed via Aesop learning, then the Curse Is Foiled Again. If a character is given a lame power but manages to use it to great effect, you've found that Heart Is an Awesome Power.
This is Older Than Feudalism, and it's a perfect way to teach the Aesop of Be Careful What You Wish For. Supertrope to Does Not Know His Own Strength, Immunity Disability, Midas Touch, So Beautiful, It's a Curse, and Who Wants to Live Forever?.
Compare/contrast with Awesome, but Impractical (which it is often mistaken for by the looks of most of the tropes), Super Loser, Super Zeroes, Power Incontinence, Bad Powers, Bad People. See also Curse. Contrast a Curse That Cures, when a Curse cures a character of an illness or disease they already had. For characters blessed with awesome, see With Great Power Comes Great Perks."
t02502,BloodMagic,"Spilling of blood is a potent force in the working of magic. It may be a token sacrifice, but it may also be the loss of life that fuels the spell. Expect mages who practice Blood Magic to be portrayed as evil, or at least dark grey, with possible exceptions made for druidlike nature cults that may be considered amoral.
Some blood may be indicated to be more powerful than others. Common types are human blood, the blood of royalty, the blood of a special line, the blood of an innocent, a child's blood, the caster's own blood,note as a self-sacrifice, this version is the only one even remotely likely to be practiced by good characters or virgin's blood. Sometimes only a single person's blood has power, and any other blood is powerless.
The other side of the coin is menstrual blood, which is used much less frequently but is associated with life magic when it is used. Except, of course, when it's the Menstrual Menace.
This trope is Older Than Feudalism, with blood and sacrifice being powerful magic in some of the oldest tales. A very old Greek curse was for a witch to run three times around the house she wished to curse while menstruating. Especially potent if it was her first period. It is frequently the alternative to Necromancy as the ""evil magic"".
Often overlaps with Black Magic, The Dark Arts and Cast from Hit Points. See also Our Vampires Are Different and Body to Jewel.
Frequently a part of any ritualistic Blood Bath. When it's the blood itself doing the damage, you have Bloody Murder. When the magic is used to extend the user's lifespan, it's Life Drinker. When it's used to create life, it's Fertile Blood.
May even overlap with Tome of Eldritch Lore, which is often written in man's blood on parchment made of human flesh. Is often a cause for a Superhuman Transfusion."
t02525,BlueAndOrangeMorality,"To say that questions of morality are thorny and filled with gray when they aren't being hammered between stark absolutes is putting it mildly. Because of this there can be great drama when characters who represent a wide range of moral viewpoints come together or into conflict.
The strangest of these characters are those who espouse Blue and Orange Morality. These characters have a moral framework that is so utterly alien and foreign to human experience that we can't peg them as ""good"" or ""evil"". They aren't a Chaotic Neutral Unfettered, though they may seem to act terrifyingly randomly; nor are they necessarily a Lawful Neutral Fettered, because our and their understanding of ""law"" as a concept may not even be equivalent. There might be a logic behind their actions, it's just that they operate with entirely different sets of values and premises with which to draw their conclusions. It's also worth noting that such cultures are just as likely to be something we'd find appalling, as they are to be something we'd find benign and/or weird. They may also find us appalling, benign, or weird even if we don't see them that way.
And although they are often likely to commit acts we would see as horrific, some are unusually benign. Either way they tend to act as if nothing were the matter. Because in their world/mind, that's just what they do. This trope is one of the trickier to pull off well, because Most Writers Are Human, and it's often hard to portray alien and truly foreign. Because of this, it's not uncommon for audience members to label these characters as Designated Heroes or villains due to human audiences often lacking the experience or knowledge that these fictional characters have. Audiences must remember that these characters are meant to be Morally Ambiguous.
This is similar to Values Dissonance, but the main difference is that societies with Values Dissonance can, at least on a basic level, generally measure one another by the same concepts of Good and Evil, or even Order and Chaos. With Blue and Orange Morality, the values are so foreign, that such concepts can no longer be applied. They may not even know what these things are, or even if they do, will often find them confusing. The concepts are not necessarily beyond their grasp, mind you, but just aren't something which they'd place any importance on.
Conversely, they may have these concepts, but apply them in vastly different ways. Such as regarding motionlessness as the epitome of evil, or viewing exploration as an element of chaos.
Note that cases involving solely a misapprehension of facts and consequences do not count here no matter how alien the reasons; if, for example, a race of aliens thinks killing is okay because its own members respawn within a day with no harm done, and mistake humans as working the same way, that doesn't mean they wouldn't balk at killing if they realized the degree of harm it causes to other creatures. In this case, they may be working by comprehensible moral standards and just gravely mistaken about the implications of their actions.
Likely candidates for Blue and Orange Morality include The Fair Folk, who follow rules of their own making; Eldritch Abominations that are beyond comprehension; the more exotic Starfish Aliens; AIs and robots, especially when super smart and/or incapable of emotion. Another candidate is the power of money or The Almighty Dollar. An individual human (or single members of any species whose majority falls into darker morality) who operates on this is the Übermensch of Nietzschean philosophy (a human being who has developed their own Blue/Orange set of morals). A Nominal Hero may have this motivation as well. Moral Sociopathy overlaps strongly with this trope for obvious reasons, though this is not always the case.
Compare Xenofiction, Humans Are Cthulhu, Humanity Is Infectious (all often involving this), Above Good and Evil, Affably Evil / Faux Affably Evil (they sometimes can come across as this), Even Evil Has Standards (when handled poorly or bizarrely), Evil Cannot Comprehend Good (less elaborate forms that resemble this in practice), and Non-Malicious Monster (which occasionally requires this), and Obliviously Evil (when a villain thinks that his actions are acceptable or helpful). When two sides go to war and nothing will stop them except total annihilation, that's Guilt-Free Extermination War. If the character genuinely knows everything will turn out okay, allowing the plot to treat them as a good guy no matter how cruel, irresponsible or fascist this makes them by our standards, that's Omniscient Morality License.
Has nothing to do with the following: Bucknell University, The University of Illinois, The University of Virginia, The University of Florida, Auburn University, Syracuse University, Hope College, Gettysburg College or Boise State University (the colors of all of which are blue and orange, albeit different shades in each case). Nor the Denver Broncos, Chicago Bears, New York Knicks, New York Mets, New York Islanders, Edmonton Oilers, or Mango Sentinels. Or the City of New York, for that matter. Furthermore, do not confuse with Blue and Orange Movies (even if they do overlap). Also has nothing to do with the Karma Meter in Mass Effect, nor the Aperture Science Hand Held Portal Device, the two most prominent ink colors in Splatoon, or even the light scheme in TRON and its universe."
t02568,BodyHorror,"Welcome to the lovely land of Body Horror. Simply put, this is any form of Horror or Squickiness involving body parts, parasitism, disfigurement, mutation, or unsettling bodily configuration, not induced by immediate violence.
For example: Being shot in the chest and having your organs exposed is Bloody Horror, not body horror. Turning into a monster is a Baleful Polymorph, but still not a body horror. Having your chest tear open of its own free will, exposing your organs as your ribcage is repurposed as a gaping maw full of bony teeth? That is Body Horror.
This trope is difficult to pin down, as it has a wide range of potential applications and invocations, but what they all hinge upon is the Primal Fear of the Uncanny Valley, deformity, parasites, contamination, the ravages of disease, and the aftermath of bodily injury. The mind knows on a deep instinctive level that faces should have eyes and hands should not. Organs and bones belong on the inside, and parasites and circuit boards do not. Bodies should be roughly symmetrical and have logical proportions. And nothing should ever look like this page's example image.
Slowly mutating in a sickeningly twisted and deformed manner after contracting The Virus, a close encounter of the squick kind leaving someone the incubator for a Chest Burster, a rotting zombie, an Eldritch Abomination resembling a tangle of organs, and a shapeshifter abandoning any attempt at aesthetics or imitation to become a writhing mass of random but recognizable parts are all examples of Body Horror.
Obviously, as a trope based on Primal Fear, body horror is Older Than Dirt.
For a character or Mook who has this as their back story, see Was Once a Man and Tragic Monster, and/or The Grotesque. If Body Horror is played for sympathy, it can be used to explore the issue of What Measure Is a Non-Human?. It can result in And I Must Scream if the victim is aware of their condition but totally helpless. Using this trope can result in Our Monsters Are Weird of the most horrific kind.
Sub-supertrope of Evil Is Visceral."
t02627,BookEnds,"-we came in?
Matching scenes at the beginning and end of a story, often to show how things have changed through the course of the series, or that they haven't changed at all.
This is extensively used in kids' shows to illustrate the characters applying the lesson they learned today, which happens to apply to the issue presented in the beginning. Ya'know, just in case they didn't catch it. In any work, book-ends are a way to show if Character Development has occurred.
Compare and contrast Here We Go Again!, How We Got Here, Where It All Began. See also Call-Back, Ironic Echo. Often utilized in an And the Adventure Continues ending, with the last scene of the series mimicking the first, regardless of how long it's been running.
Not to be confused with the Simon  Garfunkel album of the same name.
Warning: Book-Ends don't always spoil the ending, but they usually do. So, watch out for spoilers ahead!"
t02654,BornAsAnAdult,"When a creature or species essentially comes into the world in an adult body. This may result from the creature having been deliberately created by someone else, or it just may be the way their species works. A given for robots (aside from the occasional Robot Kid), as they are not technically ""born"", they are built.
If the character is lucky, they will be born with the sufficient skills to survive in the world. If not, the character is probably in for a very rough and awkward time.
Such a character is potentially subject to Merlin Sickness — being born old but then proceeding to age backwards. It's also possible that the character Really Was Born Yesterday.
Sub-Trope of Younger Than They Look."
t02810,BreakTheCutie,"A series introduces a character as sweet and lovable, more comic relief than anything, who likes nothing more than to pet little creatures. They make you adore them, root for them and love them.
Then the writers proceed to slowly torment them in front of your very eyes. They destroy everything important to them, kill everyone they love and make them suffer from horrible accidents, diseases and acts of violence, including but not limited to torture, rape or any other Fate Worse than Death. They beat the character with one cruel stroke of fate after another until they are just an Empty Shell of their former cheerful, carefree self.
This technique is often used to build The Woobie in an attempt to enhance ""adorability"" points. Writers have to be careful or else The Cutie will become the universe's Chew Toy or cause Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy if too much misery is heaped on them.
Be careful about tormenting sweet little things — sometimes instead of breaking, or when there's nothing left to break, they snap. If they snap, you'd better hope your life insurance policy is up to date, especially if the cutie was a badass to begin with. If they break but refuse to show it, they could be a Stepford Smiler.
Sometimes it can be Corrupt the Cutie, where the character in question breaks it by herself. Frequently a part of a character crossing the Despair Event Horizon or the cause of a Heroic BSoD. Also frequently part of the backstory of the Broken Bird, and instrumental in the Freudian Excuse of a villain who Used to Be a Sweet Kid. Compare Prone to Tears, who may have once undergone this, and Wide-Eyed Idealist.
On a more constructive note, sometimes breaking the cutie can result in a cute but weak character Taking a Level in Badass as they confront their tormentors and become more assertive. Circumstances may even lead to a cutie making an emotional recovery and regaining their sweet, hopeful nature. When the cutie refuses to break, they might become an iron or Stoic Woobie, a Determinator, or a Plucky Girl. If they are simply unbreakable to begin with, they are probably a Pollyanna.
Contrast Break the Haughty, where bad things happen to an arrogant person who had it coming, Break the Badass (when a super-strong person is put through the gutter), or the even worse variation, Kill the Cutie. On the other hand, it may be possible to Heal the Cutie."
t02812,BreakTheHaughty,"In fiction, it's dangerous to carry one's head too high. What kind of character is used for this story varies; it can be anyone from a Jerkass to a Corrupt Corporate Executive. Extra points if the character has not only a high opinion of themselves but also a low opinion of everyone else.
But unfortunately for them, they are usually so busy kissing their mirror they don't see that the plot has a very special treat in stock for them that will thoroughly teach them the error of their ways right before our eyes.
The ""breakings"" usually involve misfortunes increasing in unpleasantness, Mind Rape, killing everyone they love, And I Must Scream, disease, Cold-Blooded Torture, horrible accidents, and so on; the character will fail in the field they pride themselves on, lose all admirers or their power, and they alone will be responsible for their problems. Also, they might get pummeled into the ground or verbally torn apart by a ""The Reason You Suck"" Speech, anything that knocks them off their high horse. No matter how, they either end up bitter and alone or having to depend on others - either way, eating a good fat slice of Humble Pie. This trope evokes either sympathy or schadenfreude from the public; the high-and-mighty may learn the Aesop or not, but the public gets to learn it either way.
Which is a rather old idea: The Ancient Greeks considered Hubris (overbearing pride) to be one of the greatest and most self-destructive sins. Thus, there are quite a number of stories about how those guilty of it are punished, either by circumstances or by the gods (although circumstances are generally also considered caused by the gods). The Greeks even had a god specifically for the punishment of hubris, the goddess Nemesis. Or, as Brick Top put it, ""Do you know what 'nemesis' means? A righteous infliction of retribution manifested by an appropriate agent..."" The Greeks loved poetic justice; the proud were always brought down by something... appropriate.
See Pride Before a Fall for a fall that happens at once right at the beginning; Ineffectual Loner and Insufferable Genius for characters who are much at risk of getting this plot line for them; Fallen Princess for a heroine whom The Call itself punishes with a drop in status; Small Name, Big Ego for a character whose overinflated self-image will be shattered; and Royal Brats for characters whom the audience will be begging to see broken. If the setting is High School, the Alpha Bitch and the Jerk Jock will be the victims of such a plot.
Compare Sudden Humility, which may or may not affect a haughty character.
Often seen in a Slobs vs. Snobs conflict or a Backstory. If the Hubris is society-wide, see Look on My Works, Ye Mighty, and Despair! and And Man Grew Proud. A harsh instance of this trope can result in Redemption Equals Affliction.
If this is the protagonist's main character development, it's a Jerk-to-Nice-Guy Plot."
t02839,BrickJoke,"Named after an old joke, which seems at first blush to be a pair of unrelated jokes. At the end of the first joke, a brick is tossed away, leaving the confused listener without a punchline. At the end of the second joke, the brick returns and the listener falls on the floor laughing. For bonus points, the teller can tell an actual unrelated joke in between. Sometimes, the Brick Joke structure of introducing a seemingly irrelevant feature, only to return to it much later, after the audience has largely forgotten about it, can be used for drama as well as comedy; when that feature was a joke, it's known as Chekhov's Gag.
Popularized in early 20th-century Newspaper Comics by Krazy Kat.
In a masterclass on playwriting, Alan Ayckbourn mentions this trope specifically, calling it ""The Plant"". Early on, one of his two demonstration actors mentions that he has an urge to sneeze when sexually aroused. Then at the very end:
The Stinger usually consists of one. Contrast All There in the Stinger, when the Stinger contains information that's vital to understanding the plot. Compare and Contrast with the Overly Long Gag, where the humor is in how long it takes to get to the punchline. See also Late to the Punchline, which is where a character who doesn't get a joke finally gets it, making it a kind of Brick Joke for that character. See Comeback Tomorrow if the character finally delivers their late comeback to a confused opponent. See also Something We Forgot and ""Shaggy Dog"" Story.
Arguably, what is probably the longest brick joke in history occurs in the series finale of Newhart, where Bob is hit on the head, and wakes up in bed with his wife Emily from his previous series The Bob Newhart Show as a parody of the ""It Was All A Dream"" story line in the series Dallas, implying the series Newhart is a dream Bob has each night."
t02883,BrokenBird,"These characters (often female) are coping with a Cynicism Catalyst, a Despair Event Horizon, or a Dark and Troubled Past by becoming as cynical, stoic, and/or badass as possible.
Her deep experience and emotional detachment almost always give the impression of competence, though she doesn't always live up to her own hype. Varying between Cool Big Sis, Emotionless Girl, Little Miss Snarker, and Snark Knight, she marks herself as more experienced and worldly than the other characters, even if the Competence Zone means she herself is barely out of her teens.
In fact, she can sometimes fill a mentor role for less experienced and more idealistic characters, all the while loudly expressing her irritation with said arrangement, so no one gets the impression she's softening up. Sometimes, this is to Jerkass levels; however, she is often a sympathetic Jerk with a Heart of Gold, giving an impression of independent toughness to hide a sincere affection for the other characters.
This character was a hero herself once and failed miserably, or maybe she was abused in some way as a kid; whatever the case, her cynicism undoubtedly stems from some traumatic event in her past that destroyed her faith in just about everything. This revelation is normally accompanied by a Freak Out!, said past often delivered in a bitter diatribe towards someone who proved a bit too stubborn in their desire to know what it was. At this point, tears are guaranteed, probably more of them the less she's expressed emotion in the past. She also has a 65% chance of engaging in serious physical violence against whoever is closest at the time. This is always treated seriously and Broken Birds have a tendency to be both prone to violence and very good at it, therefore, potential Love Interests should always prepare to be at least slightly maimed during these breakdowns.
If she is cured of her emotional torment, expect any of a number of paths. At best, she will continue on as a deeper and less emotionally constipated version of who she was before... but she may also fall prey to Good Is Dumb or mutate into a Satellite Love Interest or Satellite Character. Expect Hope Is Scary on the road to recovery, unless she has an Adrenaline Makeover. Once she recovers, she's quite likely to swear not to become one ever again.
A number of Romance Novels lean on this trope when the love interest of the heroine is an Anti-Hero with a scar from the past for her to heal. Sometimes involves a bit of that one as well. Women want to Heal the Cutie instead of Break the Cutie.
This trope can be summed up as Troubled, but Cute + Dark and Troubled Past.
Popular with Byronic Hero. A subtrope of Troubled, but Cute, which sometimes they start as before becoming broken. Overlaps with Stoic Woobie and Jerkass Woobie. Also see Dark Magical Girl when the Broken Bird happened to be a Magical Girl, Rape as Backstory and Rape as Drama for when the traumatic event involved sexual violence, My Greatest Failure for when the trauma was brought on by a mistake the character made (or thinks she made) and Shellshocked Veteran when her trauma was brought by warfare. Do note that in Real Life, not everyone who experiences trauma (even the same type of trauma) will react or respond in this way; just because they don't act like or come across as this trope doesn't mean they're lying about whatever it was they experienced.
The logical extreme of this becomes an Empty Shell. Compare/contrast Stepford Smiler, Stepford Snarker, and Sour Outside, Sad Inside, for characters trying to hide their Broken Bird state. Contrast Angst? What Angst? and The Pollyanna.
Not to be confused with Broken Bird, a Naruto fanfic of the same name."
t02912,BrotherSisterIncest,"Romantic or sexual attraction between siblings. Most of the time it may be merely implied, but sometimes it's laid out right in the open for the viewer to see. Its presence in a story usually adds a great deal of emotional intensity.
Frequently actual incest is avoided through the device of siblings who aren't really — they're fostered, or step-sibs, or adopted. Thus, while in arbitrary terms of relationship they may be brother or sister, in ""true"" terms of blood they are not, and may pursue their chosen target with relative impunity. Often it's just an extreme version of the Childhood Friend Romance setup; male and female characters who normally couldn't cohabitate or possibly even interact normally with each other are 'forced' to but meet with an arbitrary contrivance preventing them from developing past it. The only difference is that the audience is more likely to accept the latter contrivance as believable.
Many sociologists and evolutionary psychologists believe that the instinctual aversion to incest has developed to avoid the pairing of rare, potentially lethal, recessive genes. The incest taboo is implemented through the Westermarck effect, in that growing up in proximity at a young age (through approximately six years of age) renders it sufficiently likely that the persons are siblings, to trigger the instinctive aversion. Many close tribal and small village communities marry outside of the tribe or village, and many childhood friends end up unlucky, because of this. This would also explain why brother-sister incest was possible among Egyptian royals (where the girls were raised separately from the boys and didn't even meet until after puberty), while some European royal families such as the Valois faced extinction because the king and queen couldn't bear to touch each other - not because they were that closely related, but because they'd been brought up together since early childhood and thought of each other as siblings.
Although the Japanese have just as much of an incest taboo as any other culture, there does not seem to be any automatic assumption of tragedy surrounding incestuous relationships in anime, as there would be in most Western productions. It may be shown as sad, improper, and/or perhaps even reprehensible, but participants are no more likely to come out to a bad end than any other characters in the story. A supposed Japanese legend which states that star-crossed lovers are reborn as siblings probably has something to do with it as well.
It is also very common in Japanese works, at least, to see a girl address a boy she's interested in as onii-sama, the ultra-respectful form of... 'big brother'. For example, in Mai-HiME, Munakata Shiho addresses Tate Yuuichi in exactly this way, and harbors an obsessive desire for him that leads to some fairly serious jealousy of her rival (Tokiha Mai). This is also a common trope of bishoujo games. Of course, this is more a Japanese language trope; onii-sama or onee-sama (""big sister"") is a fairly standard thing to call someone older than you that you respect.
Compare Incest Is Relative, Only Child Syndrome. See also Creepy Twins, Twincest, Not Blood Siblings, Kissing Cousins, Big Brother Attraction.
Contrast with Parental Incest, where the parent/child power dynamics can make it even squickier. Not to be confused with Double In-Law Marriage, where both of the couples are Not Blood Siblings but siblings-in-law. May show up in works with a Little Sister Heroine.
NOTE: This trope is for actual cases of incest in-story. Incestuous subtext goes in Incest Subtext."
t02925,BruiserWithASoftCenter,"The big, burly, super macho guy who is nothing but a stack of muscles is pretty much a brick, right? Not so much. True love or a sweet, touching moment reveals what a big softy he really is under all that hard muscle. Hands that can smash through walls effortlessly now rise to hide the Tender Tears, or remain stoically at his sides as he weeps Manly Tears.
Thugs will limp away nursing cuts and bruises from his mighty fists. Children and small cuddly animals will simply treat his great ham hands like cozy furniture to snuggle up in. Enemies will flee from his mighty roar or battle cry. But he will sit still and quiet if a kitten curls up on his chest purring, and he'll let her stay as long as she pleases.
Some of the bruisers have no embarrassment at having a soft center, but others will instantly try to cover it up; or matter-of-factly inform their companions that ""if you tell anyone this happened, I'll deny it""; still others will ensure the silence of those who witnessed their soft heart showing with threats.
While this trope tends to trend mostly male, females are not exempt from being bruisers with soft centers.
This trope also tends to trend mostly heroic, but the occasional villain will also prove he's not made of stone by showing his soft side amongst a trusted few or in private.
This is a trope with a lot of neighbours: Compare with Gentle Giant, Genius Bruiser, Real Men Wear Pink, Morality Pet, and Jerk with a Heart of Gold. Even a Papa Wolf can turn soft when he's around his children. Super-Trope of Emotional Bruiser."
t03051,ButtMonkey,"The character who is always the butt of the demeaning joke or the ""put them through hell"" plotline. For whatever reason, the Butt Monkey seems to walk through life with a permanent ""Kick Me"" sign attached to their backs, invisible to them, but all too visible to the rest of the world. Nothing ever goes right for this character, and if something bad is going to happen to someone, chances are it's going to happen to them. Long story short, it sucks to be the Butt Monkey.
Simply having a character go through hell once or twice (no matter how severely) is not enough to be the Butt Monkey. With primary and secondary characters, it must be a regular occurrence. With tertiary characters, it must be their sole purpose to exist. It's not necessarily Karma. They don't have to deserve what they go through, but they're an easy target. Sometimes it's all the writers can think of to do with the character.
The direct opposite of a Karma Houdini (although technically the definition applies to those who escape from karma regardless of whether it's good or bad). If carried too far, may result in Deus Angst Machina. This can be counteracted if you occasionally Throw the Dog a Bone, though many writers just can't resist Yanking The Dog's Chain. The Butt Monkey is occasionally dangerous if they're pushed too far.
If the audience sympathizes with them, they become a Woobie. Furthermore, if the audience begins to resent the ""unfair"" treatment of the character, they can become the Designated Monkey. The joke can also be dragged too far in other ways — to make a character a Butt Monkey of fate is one thing; to have them constantly taking the punishment for the misdeeds of an unsympathetic cast is another. However, if the audience relishes the character's misfortune and looks forward to seeing them suffer, congratulations; your Butt Monkey has devolved into The Chew Toy.
While the trope is often played for laughs and we are encouraged to find the misery at least somewhat amusing, some portrayals go for a much darker presentation, deconstructing the idea and showing what an emotional and psychological wreck such a person would be like in real life.
Almost Always Male. In cases that the Butt Monkey is female, is regularly used for slapstick and it is Played for Laughs, she is probably also a case of Slapstick Knows No Gender. If every conceivable misfortune happens to the Butt Monkey, regardless of its logic or lack thereof, you've got yourself a Cosmic Plaything.
If someone is Giving the Sword to a Noob, nine times out of ten this person is the noob. When a plan needs to be executed and others won't touch it, chances are they'll get the dirty job. If a plan requires someone to be The Bait, if the other members of the team don't volunteer, they'll usually get volunteered to do it. On the other hand, if someone in the cast other than The Hero is going to Take a Level in Badass, it's almost invariably the Butt Monkey who does it. If the Butt Monkey is fat, they may or may not be a Fat Comic Relief, which often are Butt Monkeys.
See also: Bumbling Sidekick, The Un-Favourite, Guilt by Association Gag, Humiliation Conga, Iron Butt Monkey. Is nearly always on the receiving end of Comedic Sociopathy. When a character isn't a Butt Monkey in the work itself, but gets treated as one in Fanon, that's Memetic Loser.
Do note that the Butt Monkey is often not meant to be hated by the audience. For characters completely intended to be dislikable, contrast Hate Sink.
In real life, everyone single one of us runs into bad luck now and then, so said examples are not possible."
t03082,CainAndAbel,"Sometimes Sibling Rivalry can get a little… intense. Maybe one who Missed the Call gets overly jealous that the other has become The Chosen One, maybe grand powers or knighthood run in the family and one just happens to have been tempted to The Dark Side, maybe one of them betrayed their master or father and the other has to stop him, or maybe it's just Because Destiny Says So, dammit. Whatever the case may be, now one's the hero and one's the villain, and they must do battle. Commence the angst.
For whatever reason, the older sibling is almost always the villainous one. Probably because being younger and less experienced makes the younger sibling the underdog, whom we are supposed to root for. And because the Aloof Big Brother always looks eviler. The major exception is the case of The Evil Prince, who is usually the younger of two princes, and who will do anything to make sure he succeeds their father instead of his brother (or in the case of the prince being the king's brother, to take the throne for himself directly).
It's not always siblings — Childhood Friends get to experience all the same woes from beating up someone they grew up with — but there's a certain poetry when they're actually related. Note that they are traditionally always of the same sex: brothers or sisters (though there are exceptions).
In cases where the Cain turns out to be The Un-Favourite, he's likely to be viewed from a more sympathetic angle. Of course, this would partially also depend on the sibling's attitude in all this. Sometimes the siblings will become The Only One Allowed to Defeat You, or realize they're Not So Different. If the hero isn't aware of the relation until late in the series, it's also a Luke, I Am Your Father. We Used to Be Friends and Evil Former Friend also counts if the siblings in question were former friends with each other. Compare Oedipus Complex. Contrast Sibling Team. Also contrast Bash Brothers, where the two people (who may or may not be brothers) beat up other people instead of each other. When Cain is gunning for mom and dad instead of Abel see Antagonistic Offspring.
The trope title, of course, comes from the biblical story of the first siblings to exist. See also Name of Cain. When There Is Another, compare Cain and Abel and Seth. May overlap with Big Brother Bully if said bully is truly malignant. If such a situation turns lethal, it's Sibling Murder. If not a Good vs. Evil situation, see Sibling Rivalry.
Not to be confused with the two recurring Character Archetypes found in the Fire Emblem series."
t03097,CallBack,"A relevant reference to an event taking place earlier than the timeline of the present story. One type of call back is a Running Gag. This is often used to remind viewers that there is an ongoing storyline. More or less a Shout-Out to itself — but if that's all that it's doing, then it's a Continuity Nod; a Call-Back brings back an element that is actually relevant again.
Compare:
Alternately, in comedy: Tying the loose ends of a later, seemingly unrelated, joke to one earlier in the show; better known as a Brick Joke.
Sometimes a Call-Back will take up so much of a chapter or episode that it becomes a Sequel Episode to the earlier story it's referencing.
The opposite of this is either Foreshadowing (a forward reference done in a previous episode) or Call-Forward (a ""fake"" forward reference in a flashback or prequel). See also Chekhov's Gun, Chekhov's Boomerang, Brick Joke, Book-Ends, Mythology Gag, Sequel Episode, Internal Homage, and Meaningful Echo."
t03105,CallingTheOldManOut,"Did Mom and/or Dad leave you without an explanation, only to pop up years later expecting hugs and kisses? Are you tired of listening to the same Freudian Excuse for frequently screwing up their lives and yours? Is endlessly sucking up to the ""Well Done, Son!"" Guy for the tiniest crumb of respect really starting to get on your nerves? This is when standing your own ground comes to play.
Right. Time to take a page from Oedipus Rex and let your parental figure know how you REALLY feel.
It's time to Call The Old Man Out, or the Old Woman, if it's your mother you have issues with. Time for a real shout-down with that dysfunctional parental figure. Possibly even a beat down if you really get into it. (We suggest you try not to go any farther than that; killing a parent, even one who arguably deserves it, tends to put you in the villain camp by default. Even Oedipus got nailed for it eventually, and he didn't even KNOW the man was his father.)
You see this trope whenever a child figure (who is most often fully adult in age, but in rare cases may still be a child or teenager) goes into full-on confrontational mode with a parent figure they feel has severely wronged them. ""Child"" and ""parent"" can be fairly loose here — it's the power relationship that's key, not the genetics. Although the confrontation can be quite long-winded as it plays out, the semantic content usually boils down to ""Daddy/Mommy, you SUCK!"". For some reason, father figures are far more often targeted for this, due to the general belief that most women tend to be better parental figures than fathers, or maybe it's just not considered nice to yell at Mom. This can be a double whammy if the ""parent"" is also The Caretaker since they're essentially the child's lifeline and are wronging them.
Also, for this trope to come into play, the parental figure must truly have transgressed, or the child figure must have good reason to believe the transgression has happened. If the child figure is not at least somewhat justified in their accusations, it's not Calling The Old Man Out — it's just throwing a temper tantrum.
Bonus points are awarded if the child is able to (correctly) point out that they have managed not to repeat the parental mistakes with their own offspring. Penalty points are awarded if they have tragically repeated exactly the same mistakes with their own offspring. Of course, the parent may be happy either way.
Sometimes, the writer may not want the child figure to be the one doing the calling out. Maybe they want to keep the child figure Really Nice, so nice they won't even yell at an abusive parent. Maybe they want to show that the child figure is still so thoroughly whipped by the abusive parent that they are still incapable of facing them. Maybe the child is hoping that Daddy may still turn out to be good after all, despite the abuse, and is therefore holding back on giving him the what-for. Maybe they feel that the accusation will seem less whiny if an outsider delivers it, thereby validating the abuse in the eyes of a third person. In such a case, someone who loves the child figure may step in and deliver the calling out vicariously — ""How dare you treat your child like that, you monster!"" Spouses, boyfriends/girlfriends, aunts/uncles, mentors, best friends, or possibly even older siblings may step in and take on this job for someone unwilling or unable to do it for themselves.
The results of Calling The Old Man Out can vary widely. Clearing the air might be a good thing, and result in some kind of parent-child reconciliation. (A common variant is when the parent can provide some kind of reasonable explanation for why bad things were allowed to happen that the child was not previously aware of.) It might result in a permanent break between parent and child. It might even provide a powerful catharsis for the child figure, allowing Character Development to take place through resolving that Freudian Excuse, Parental Abandonment issue, or ""Well Done, Son!"" Guy obsession the character has been carrying around most of his or her life. If the parent being called out is a villain, it might result in that parent having a breakdown (if the parent hasn't had one already) and going on the warpath against the child. In extreme cases, the parent, the child, or both, might end up dead. Maybe the parent is touched by what the child said and reconciles with the child. Maybe nothing at all changes.
Just out of fairness, it should be mentioned that good old Oedipus himself is not truly an example of this trope, as he did not know he was killing his father when it happened and was not intentionally doing it as revenge for his father spiking his feet and leaving him to die on a hillside as a baby. Oedipus killed the old man for cutting him off in traffic.
Subtrope of Grew a Spine. Compare Rage Against the Mentor. See also I Hate You, Vampire Dad. As noted, Abusive Parents will likely be on the receiving end, putting this on the far side of the Sliding Scale of Parent-Shaming in Fiction. Often a subtrope of ""The Reason You Suck"" Speech."
t03332,CassandraTruth,"Sometimes people just won't believe you.
You try your hardest to tell someone that your parents are actually super villains and that you need their help to bring them down, or that aliens have landed in your backyard and are now plundering your kitchen, or that the nice grandpa in the flat above you is in fact an evil bloodthirsty creature from another dimension, but the authorities look at you like you are crazy and send you packing, or that some random frog you came across one day can sing and dance. What's a lone protagonist to do?
In Robert A. Heinlein's Time Enough for Love, Lazarus Long tells the two best ways to tell a lie.
A common staple of Disney and children's films, where the Kid Hero stumbles upon an evil conspiracy or a criminal ring and their parents and the police refuse to listen. The only thing to do is to save the day yourself, with PG heroics and Scooby-Doo style.
If the protagonist trying to report the situation works for someone who can actually do something about it, such as the FBI, it's not so much that they aren't believed, but Da Chief will tell them that it isn't worth it to expend resources ""on a hunch"".
This sort of situation can also be used to maintain the Masquerade: if a minor character finds out and tries to tell someone that the guy next door is secretly a Warrior of Justice, they won't be believed, because who would ever think that that foppish playboy could really be the dark, grim Super Hero? Often though, it's because they're horrible at wording it so it sounds genuinely insane.
Sometimes Alice actually asks what's going on and, when given the true-but-bizarre explanation by Bob, responds ""Well, if you don't want to tell me, just say so"". As it turns out the truth is Freakier Than Fiction (in-universe, anyway) and thus Alice thinks the truth is obviously made up by Bob. This is often Played for Laughs, and sometimes it will ironically be used as reverse psychology by Bob to either:
Related to Devil in Plain Sight, except that in that case, the disbelief is mainly due to the deceptive abilities of the ""devil"", whereas in this one, it's usually due to strange circumstances, the perceived unreliability of the speaker, or just plain bad luck. It can also be a Crying Wolf situation, where the fact that the character lied previously is obfuscating the fact that they're telling the truth now. It can also be caused by the ""normalcy bias"", where people underestimate the likeliness of a disaster or how bad it could be. (Think of the people in the path of a hurricane who refuse to evacuate.) If it deals with uncovering something that might be dangerous and people don't believe the person not because they think they are lying but because they are crazy, see Properly Paranoid.
The title comes from the mythical seer Cassandra, whose prophecies were always accurate, but never believed because of a curse placed on her by the god Apollo, thus making this Older Than Feudalism. (Writers of speculative fiction just looove to name precognitive or clairvoyant characters ""Cassandra"" or some variant thereof, like in Smallville, Buffy, My Hero, Red Dwarf, and The X-Files).
If the person telling the truth is an NPC in a video game, they're spouting Infallible Babble. In this case, the in-game characters won't believe them.
If the character is the one guy to figure something out despite all the much more expert people working on the problem, he is an Einstein Sue.
This is often played to ridicule the doubters, even when the truth is on the level of the absurd. A protagonist warns others of a completely unlikely, nigh impossible event, but the audience, in on the secret, perceives a truth they would normally doubt themselves as completely obvious.
Subtropes are Ignored Expert and The Cassandra, where the character in question is in a position where they really should be believed, due to authority on the subject or track record of accuracy, but still isn't.
See also Not-So-Imaginary Friend, for a specific situation where the ""truth"" is the existence of a character. If the person telling the truth is dismissed by law enforcement officers, it's Police are Useless. When the truth in question has something to do with Medium Awareness, compare Audience? What Audience?. And when it's the story itself that's being accurate/factual and the audience who doesn't buy into it, that's Aluminum Christmas Trees.
Contrast with Sarcastic Confession and You Wouldn't Believe Me If I Told You, or Internal Reveal when they believe the truth. A particularly cynical twist is when whoever wasn't listening concludes that Cassandra Did It when what she's saying comes true or to have someone finally believe them, only for their new proponent to find that its a Contagious Cassandra Truth. Can overlap with Don't Shoot the Message if the truth is defended badly, jerkishly, and/or tyranically.
May involve Refuge in Audacity if the character counts on others not believing in him to get off scot-free.
The Other Wiki even has an article about Cassandra Truth."
t03382,CatchPhrase,"An expression used by a character numerous times in a work. Merely uttering this phrase in the office will clue others in to the character you're referring to.
To be a Catch-Phrase, the phrase must be repeated multiple times in an identifiable way—what is simply the most memorable line of a movie is not a Catch-Phrase unless it is repeated by the same in-universe character. When it's the audience that adopts a character's line as a Catch-Phrase, it's a Memetic Mutation.

t03405,CatsAreMean,"Disclaimer: To any cat reading this, remember this is just a FICTIONAL trope. No hard feelings, ok? All animals (except mosquitoes) are awesome, including you. Now here's the article.
Cats get a bad rep.
While cat and dog owners can cite a truckload of quirks on both ends of the spectrum, when both species are featured in fiction, you are far more likely to find an outright cruel, nasty, and otherwise vicious cat character. Both sets of animals will have vices, but a dog is more likely to do harm unintentionally. A cat enjoys causing trouble. Parts of this have to do with traditional traits that even cat lovers admire — independence and pride for some equals lack of love for the owners and aloofness for others. As a result, many writers who like cats, such as Terry Pratchett and Paul Gallico, play into the trope by presenting their pet as something of The Chessmaster, expertly manipulating humans.
It certainly doesn't help considering highly-marketable, small creatures are typically the kind of things cats see as prey. Dogs aren't exempt from this behavior in real life but are rarely portrayed as predatory in fiction, dogs are also attracted to strong smells that disgust humans which is why some like to roll around in trash, drink toilet water or eat poop but this is also rarely shown unless Played for Laughs. Since mice (and birds) are often depicted as being intelligent, the express desire to eat them becomes a type of cannibalism and is therefore evil. Protagonist cats rarely eat mice (rats, on the other hand...). Notably, the real threat that mice present — their ability to overpopulate, consume stores, and carry dangerous parasites, and the original reason we bred cats in the first place — is seldom mentioned in fiction. Nor is the fact that a whole category of dogs — terriers — also kill small, cute rodents.
Unlike cats, dogs are rarely portrayed as evil unless the cast specifically only features dogs and antagonists are needed (the obvious exceptions, of course, being the tropes of the evil tear-'em-to-pieces junkyard dog, the psychotic poodle and the Hellhound). When they are genuinely annoying, this characteristic is given to stereotypical small yappy breeds that reflect their owners. In real life, it says more about a dog's training as many owners of small dogs continue to treat them as puppies rather than full grown dogs who need to be disciplined.
Much of this no doubt descends from Medieval European folklore associating cats with successful spinsters and later witches or other forces of evil. At the same pyres witches were burned, cats were burned too. Cats in general have been associated with women and, since Most Writers Are Male, they have often been used for misogynistic stereotypes where cats have negative traits associated with women but dogs are presented with positive traits associated with men. This stereotype even extends to the Male Gaze, where cats are seen as having sex appeal. The old saying says that dogs are a man's best friend, so men who own cats are thus seen as pussies and not ""real"" men. Many women (especially lesbians, who were often historically spinsters by necessity) have attempted to re-appropriate the ""Crazy Cat Lady"" stereotype as a positive identity.
At the same time, there is a grain of ""truth"" to this trope. ""A deadly game of cat and mouse"" is often a very real situation; cats not taught to hunt properly by their mothers often appear to clumsily toy with their prey before killing it, and even veteran mousers will play with their quarry before killing and consuming them, in order to avoid being bitten, since the saying is correct that ""even a cornered mouse will snap at a cat"" (but only when the mouse is aware of the cat; meanwhile, a cat that ambushes a mouse by surprise will kill it instantly, which is why cats are experts at hunting by stealth and secrecy). Cats are also among the few predators known to hunt and kill for fun (for a primitive value of the word fun), even when they're not going to eat the prey (though given that among the other animals known to do this are humans and the only ones who really enjoy it at that, we don't really have much room to give cats grief about it). Although this doesn't make cats ""mean"" — they don't have any understanding of morality in the first place; you know, like most animals.
Another issue is that Most Writers Are Human. We read human emotions into animals, usually unintentionally, and the cat equivalents of 'friendly' and 'happy' don't change their facial expressions. Their default expression of ""you would be repulsive if you weren't so boring"" heavily colors our idea of what goes on inside their heads — they seem either aloof or pushy. This is largely due to a lack of understanding. Cats use their tails to express emotions, and have a wide range of different ""tail expressions""; for instance, an erect tail with a small curve on top is the cat equivalent of a smile.
The Right-Hand Cat is the Diabolical Mastermind's most popular pet of choice. Could also be the reason that All Witches Have Cats; an evil witch should have a mean Familiar.
Contrast Cute Kitten (though it can go hand-in-hand with this when Cute Is Evil), but, generally, Cuteness Equals Goodness, so this trope is mostly Played for Laughs with the evil being barely above Poke the Poodle level. In general, kittens tend to be less affected by this trope adult cats are, since they are seen as cute and innocent and therefore ""good"". Consequentially, if a dog is chasing an adult cat, the dog is usually the hero, but if a dog is chasing a kitten, the dog is often the villain. This trope doesn't always apply to big wild cats in the quite same way it applies to domestic cats; lions, for example, are often portrayed as heroic because of the whole King of Beasts thing, and tigers have a similar reputation in many Asian cultures. They may still get the Predators Are Mean treatment, though, especially in stories about animals. Compare Reptiles Are Abhorrent for a similar stereotype and treatment towards reptiles.
Note that when cats just are not mean in some cases, that's Not a Subversion. Also, if the story features only cats and some happen to be the bad guys, that isn't this trope fully either.
Compare Dogs Are Dumb and Killer Rabbit. Overlaps with Cats Are Superior, especially when Dumb Is Good. May also, in some cases, lead to Cats Are Snarkers, though the two tropes can exist independently of one another. Not to be confused with CATS (although he is also pretty mean)."
t03470,CelibateHero,"Someone who has better things to do than romance. Unlike the clueless Chaste Hero, who just doesn't get romance, the Celibate Hero consciously and actively shuns it. They turn away every potential Girl of the Week and shut out the pleas of their official love interest.
While the term ""celibacy"" refers specifically to sexual activity, the history of celibacy connects the desire to romance someone with the desire to have sex with them, traditionally taking the form of marriage and kids. Ironically, the act of being celibate results in Celibate Heroes running into more opportunities for romantic encounters than if they were actively seeking them out (particularly from The Vamp). This is not to say that the Celibate Hero is unable to be affected by the force of The Dulcinea Effect, only that they either are acting on a higher ideal (chivalry) or resist its power later on.
There are a variety of potential motives for this behavior: belief that it's a distraction, a weakness, something they would like but don't have time for, etc. Sometimes the Celibate Hero is actually asexual and/or aromantic and would prefer to avoid all instances of sex and/or romance. Expect more than one reason to come into play, usually reinforcing one another; rarely do any of these show up alone. See the Analysis page for details.
Often a type of Heroic Vow; many religious or military orders of the type favored by heroes may require a Vow of Celibacy.
Please do not conclude a character is a Celibate Hero just because they lack any romantic arc. Without evidence to suggest a character would shun a sexual/romantic encounter, it's impossible to tell if they have chosen a celibate lifestyle.
Compare Asexuality, Old-Fashioned Rowboat Date, Courtly Love, Did Not Get the Girl, No Hugging, No Kissing, and Celibate Eccentric Genius (if the Celibate Hero is also a Science Hero). Compare and contrast Confirmed Bachelor, who's specifically opposed to marriage, which could be due to this trope or the opposite.
Contrast Loved I Not Honor More, Must Not Die a Virgin, Nature Abhors a Virgin, Virginity Makes You Stupid, Eunuchs Are Evil, Straight Edge Evil, Unholy Matrimony, The Power of Love, and Good People Have Good Sex."
t03558,CharacterDevelopment,"Character Development is, by definition, the change in characterization of a Dynamic Character, who changes over the course of a narrative. At its core, it shows a character changing. Most narrative fiction in any media will feature some display of this.
While the definition of ""good"" and ""bad"" character development is subjective, it's generally agreed upon that good character development is believable and rounds out a well-written character. Bad character development leads to the feeling that someone is manipulating the events to their own whims, or even reduces the character's believability (in some cases, chickification).
There are many sub-tropes that take place due to this trope, some of which include:
These are hardly the only examples. The Evil Twin of Character Development is Character Derailment. Beware this trope. To see the opposite of this trope, see Static Character. See also Flat Character and Rounded Character. Compare Hidden Depths, where something is revealed that was true all along, but would not have been visible before."
t03644,ChekhovsGun,"Chekhov, master of the short story, gave this advice: If it's not essential, don't include it in the story.
The term has come to mean ""an insignificant object that later turns out to be important."" For example, a character may find a mysterious necklace that turns out to be the power source to the Doomsday Device, but at the time of finding the object it does not seem important. The necklace was essential to the story, but its introduction downplayed its importance. Chekhov's advice was not necessarily to conceal importance, but to just not spend time on things that are not important.
A lot of people consider the phrase ""Chekhov's gun"" synonymous with foreshadowing. They are related; a gun that goes off in the third act that hasn't been in the play at all before then is going to feel like a real Ass Pull, but that's not key to the meaning of the phrase.
As a result of the success of franchises like Lost or Harry Potter, viewers and fans of Myth Arc-laden and/or carefully written shows and books have become accustomed to obsessing over minuscule details and looking out for Chekhov's Guns everywhere and anywhere... whether they actually exist or not. We call these Epileptic Trees and Wild Mass Guessing.
Part A: General cases
Part B: You know what will invariably happen when you see any of these in a scene....

Compare Schrödinger's Gun for a competing dramatic weapons dealer. Contrast to a Red Herring, where something shown early appears to be significant but was planted there just to throw you off. If there are a whole bunch of Red Herrings you might be looking at The Walrus Was Paul, where a writer wants to mock fans of Chekhov's Guns by repeatedly messing with them. If there is a very long delay between the introduction of the element and its use in the story, to the point where most of the audience has long forgotten about it, you're looking at a Brick Joke. The MacGuffin is significant for some (possibly even plot-relevant) reason, but we never find out just what it is. If the Chekhov's Gun was hiding on the other side of the Fourth Wall, you have a Ninja Prop. If a Chekhov's gun is set up but dropped (but was neither intended to distract as a Red Herring nor to be brought up later, as a Brick Joke), you have either an Aborted Arc or What Happened to the Mouse?, depending on the importance of the gun to the overall plot. If something looks like a Chekhov's Gun but is really just a piece of Narrative Filigree then that's a Cow Tool.
The Magnetic Plot Device can be a standing Chekhov's Gun to blame the plot on. The Impossible Task may require one. Also see Ass Pull, which is what the viewer can sometimes confuse this with if they miss the gun the first time (or if the gun was edited out in an adaptation).
A reverse Chekhov's Gun is also common. Explicitly showing a normally armed character forgetting his gun when leaving the house for example. The experienced troper knows that this will become the day he needs it the most.
Also referred to as ""the Indiana Jones principle"" in Thomas C. Foster's How to Read Literature Like a Professor, named after Indy's early encounter with a snake at the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark and how it set up his much larger encounter with them later on. Another term for this is ""setup and payoff"", a technique used by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the Back to the Future trilogy and regularly taught to scriptwriters nowadays.
Not to be confused with Chekov's Gun (or Chekhov's Pun, for that matter). See also Call-Back, Brick Joke, and Running Gag.
This trope contains spoilers by necessity. Read at your own risk."
t03645,ChekhovsGunman,"Any character who is innocuously and unimportantly introduced to the viewer, but who later proves to be important by the end of the story.
In other words, they're a human Chekhov's Gun. (Or a non-human animal, or an extraterrestrial, or a universe-crossing entity Ascended to a Higher Plane of Existence, or a...)
For example, in a fantasy story, the protagonists search for a legendary hero of old, repeatedly encountering a traveling drunk in each tavern who seems to serve as pure comic relief, until it is revealed that the drunk is the legendary hero, fallen on hard times.
Or consider a poolboy in the CSI mystery of the week who just happened to be at the scene of the crime just before the murder, where other leads overshadow that one until the last five minutes, when suddenly Grissom finds that one piece of evidence that conclusively proves it was him. (Of course, if the poolboy is played by George Clooney, everyone and their mother will know it was him the minute he appeared on screen.)
Or, in an episode with Two Lines, No Waiting, a character that seemed to be a Bit Character in the B plot suddenly becomes a large player in the A plot. On most Cop Dramas, this usually means the two teams are Working the Same Case.
According to Roger Ebert, you can often figure out who the murderer is (in a badly-written murder mystery, at least) by checking the Law of Conservation of Detail: The Chekhov's Gunman is the only character who doesn't seem to have any other reason for being in the story (see The Butler Did It). Compare to Narrowed It Down to the Guy I Recognize, which is based more on the actor playing the role than on the character in itself.
In video games, such characters are always obvious because they look conspicuously different from generic NPCs, and usually have a name.
When the Chekhov's Gunman is hidden by shadows, you've got yourself a case of Sinister Silhouettes. If a character originally conceived as minor becomes important through later Character Development, that's a Destined Bystander. See Early-Bird Cameo when a character makes a brief appearance well before being properly introduced in the same work or continuity. And Chekhov M.I.A. is when the Gunman is first mentioned as having gone missing.
If the gunman turns out to be a major villain, up to and including the Big Bad, then The Dog Was the Mastermind. Sometimes used to refer to a writer who constantly uses and/or is particularly skilled with using Chekhov's Gun or its variants (including the Gunman), although this isn't the primary usage.
See also Connected All Along."
t03648,ChekhovsSkill,"Training in any kind of skill, ability, or knowledge that will likely later come in handy. Much like Chekhov's Gun, Chekhov's Skill covers instances where a character takes time in-story to become proficient at something.
If the hero takes time to teach his sweetie a self-defense Judo throw during the beginning, expect this Damsel in Distress to throw the Mook holding her into a Shark Pool during the climax.
This is a counterpoint to Suddenly Always Knew That, as proficiencies are gained and learned rather than mentioned or pulled out of thin air. Taken to extremes, Chekhov's Skill can be used to justify Implausible Fencing Powers or turn the Farm Boy into a gun toting badass. In frustrating cases, it might go the way of Forgotten Phlebotinum and never see use again. Used well, it can lead to some satisfying heroics from unexpected places.
Chekhov's Skill can also be used as a catalyst for other plot elements by having one character teach another, and getting some good Character Development out of it as well. Or even drive a plot as the seeker looks for a mentor to teach them Chekhov's Skill. If the skill is too complicated to be perfected so quickly, see Instant Expert.
If it is not a skill taught or otherwise demonstrated to the individual in question, then it is a Chekhov's Hobby. In the hobby, the skill is mentioned through dialogue and never takes up more plot than that. In the skill, even if the character hasn't perfected the Dangerous Forbidden Technique it still shows them training for it.
If the character is shown training for a skill but repeatedly fails at it until everything depends on them getting it right, that's Crisis Makes Perfect. If they've been compulsively using their ability since they got it, it's New Ability Addiction.
See Workplace-Acquired Abilities when a character has developed necessary skills in his professional career. See also Someday This Will Come in Handy, Crazy-Prepared, Chekhov's Classroom. May overlap with Plot Tailored to the Party, but not necessarily. If the skill was initially perceived as useless, it could also fall into Heart Is an Awesome Power."
t03682,ChildByRape,"A subtrope of Rape as Backstory reliant on the Inverse Fertility Law. Namely, a character is conceived through rape.
Common in Fanfic, particularly among Mary Sue characters. In fiction, children conceived by rape are sometimes considered to be ""tainted"", especially in horror movies where they often grow up to be either deformed Bastard Bastard killers or straight up monsters. However, equally common for a fictional serial killer in the horror genre is, if they are conceived via rape, for their conception to be used as a Freudian Excuse, as if either their upbringing or the idea that the rapist somehow managed to ""inject evil"" into their DNA led the serial killer character to murder.
Considering that Marital Rape License was pretty much Truth in Television in all patriarchal countries at some point in history, there is plenty of proof that a child by rape usually won't turn out more evil than any other child, but writers don't let that get in the way of their horror movie plot.
If the child in question is a Heroic Bastard, then they may fear or angst about the possibility of being tainted by their parents' crimes. Especially if the victim mistreats or refuses to love their child on the basis that That Thing Is Not My Child!. Some such children go on to avenge themselves and their victimized parent upon the perpetrator. Even if the child is able to make peace with their origin, parental mistreatment or abuse might result in the child resenting his or her parents — or the situation can be flipped: even when the child is loved and assured by their parent, the child might angst about their conception. In other cases, the parent loves and accepts their child and while the child may have difficulty coming to terms with this trope, they are eventually able to do so. If the child's conception is well-known, then society at large might ostracize the victimized parent, their child, or both for being ""tainted"".
May be caused by Rape, Pillage, and Burn if a civilian is unfortunate enough to fall into enemy hands. A particularly ugly possible origin for a Half-Human Hybrid or Nonhuman Humanoid Hybrid, especially if one parent's race is Always Chaotic Evil, which is typically a case of Human Mom Nonhuman Dad as well. Such children will often be subject to Half-Breed Discrimination, especially if most conceptions of this type result from rape. Some settings where this is a common occurrence will offer a Stereotype Flip: a character whose race is usually conceived in this manner is instead born to willing, loving parents who just happen to be an Odd Couple.
A variation is Medical Rape and Impregnate, wherein a woman is made pregnant through non-sexual means without her consent.
This trope itself is Truth in Television, and not just in human beings. Scientists have found that in many species, males who cannot attract a willing mate will ambush a female as a last resort. Some species have a depressingly large number of males commit rape as their first resort, usually leading to an evolutionary ""arms race"" between males and females. Ducks are a classic example of this; if you were wondering why male mallards have such enormous cloacas,note The terms ""penis"" and ""vagina"" don't apply to bird genitals, and you will irritate biologists if you mention a bird having a penis or vagina; for both sexes, it's called the ""cloaca"" instead it's because female ducks have evolved long, branching cloacas with at least one dead end specifically in order to make forced copulation difficult and unlikely to result in conception. Some biologists have even claimed rape is an evolutionary adaption, though this view isn't accepted by most, and it remains a very controversial idea. In addition, some studies[1] suggest that, statistically, rape may have a higher probability to result in pregnancy than consensual intercourse, although why this may be remains unknown.
This was actually viewed as medically impossible for centuries in the West, due to a theory that female and male genitalia were mirror images, thus conception supposedly required ejaculation by both sexes, which they held would only happen if the sex were enjoyed (i.e. was consensual). Though there is some truth to the ""mirror image"" idea, the latter is not the case. However, you can see the problem already: the woman's pregnancy was actually a defense to rape charges. There is a remnant of the ""no pregnancy due to rape"" concept still floating around, as Todd Akin's infamous comments on ""legitimate rape"" made clear in 2012. Along with this, the idea that an orgasm means it was enjoyed, thus rape must not have occurred. This isn't the case though — orgasm has been documented to occur involuntarily for men and women."
t03687,ChildhoodFriends,"There are many kinds of friendship: work friends, school friends, drinking buddies and more. Yet one of the very closest types of friendship is that of Childhood Friends. Before you have to worry about the shock of betrayal or the possibility of romance, this is the friend that will always have your back. No one knows you better than them. And it shows when childhood friends are treated more intimately or are trusted more than other friends.
Since many friends have known each other since childhood, they're very likely to be Best Friends, or BFFs if they happen to be girls. Though their friendship can develop into other forms, such as Heterosexual Life-Partners, or a Romantic Two-Girl Friendship if they're the same gender, or Platonic Life-Partners if they're opposite sex. Regardless what form it takes, the experiences they've shared since childhood is what forms and strengthens their bond.
Supertrope of Childhood Friend Romance, Patient Childhood Love Interest, Beleaguered Childhood Friend, Forgotten First Meeting and Forgotten Friend, New Foe.
Contrast Old Flame Fizzle."
t03757,ChronicBackstabbingDisorder,"Chronic Backstabbing Disorder is when a specific character constantly and successfully betrays their apparent allegiances, only to move on to a new group and repeat the pattern. The character may be doing it for a higher purpose (making them The Chessmaster) or their own selfish betterment (making them a Wild Card), or they could just be Ax-Crazy. Different from the Heel–Face Revolving Door in that it's not always a hero/villain swap, and in fact is usually switching between different groups of antagonists.
Named for Revolver Ocelot's ""condition"" in The Last Days of FOXHOUND, which is his proclivity for this deliberately flanderized into a physical compulsion for comedic reasons.
Frequently happens when a Magnificent Bastard plays the Enigmatic Minion. Related to The Starscream, except that character type doesn't succeed (most of the time, anyways, and when they do, they usually don't get to revel in it for long). These characters are also commonly Chaotic Neutral, Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Stupid, Stupid Evil, or Stupid Neutral. (Lawful and/or good characters tend to see betrayal as a big no-no, and Neutral Evil characters (probably) won't betray their current allies just for the hell of it.) Often a characteristic of The Starscream who has his own ruling plans but just as often an Opportunistic Bastard who doesn't mind being a follower and living in the shadow of the strongest side.
As a betrayal trope, this is probably going to be spoilicious."
t03861,ClassTrip,"Any series that takes place in a school, be it elementary, middle, high, or even kindergarten, will have at least one episode that takes place during a class trip. The destination can vary, but for day trips, it's usually educational and painfully boring (like a museum, a local historical landmark, or a cardboard box factory). Kyoto is one of the most common destinations for these in Japanese Media.
A whole episode Class Trip is a great change of scenery, and gives both an interesting place to cook up wacky hijinks and a watershed moment in romantic relationships between students. It's technically Not a Date, but it gives couples a chance to sneak off and go sightseeing by themselves. The travel itself can be a bit of an adventure, and once the class gets there, there are endless opportunities for Zany Schemes, illicit romance or mistaken assumptions that zany schemes and illicit romance are happening. It's an excellent time for a First Kiss to happen. Or for a lost Monster of the Week to attack."
t03973,CluelessMystery,"The Whodunnit is a funny genre. Sometimes the author ""plays fair"" with the readers, giving them all of the clues necessary to solve the mystery at the same time as, or even before, the fictional detective.
Others don't. This type isn't intended to be participatory at all, the reader is expected to simply come along for the ride, and no effort is made to provide the clues needed to solve the mystery. This latter form is the ""Clueless Mystery"", and is, in fact, the older form. (The ""rules"" of Fair Play Mysteries were only codified in 1928.) Due to its Older Than They Think status, the Clueless Mystery can catch many modern fans off-guard, leaving them feeling cheated in a game that the author wasn't really taking part in.
One common indicator that you may be looking at a Clueless Mystery is the use of the First-Person Peripheral Narrator. By having the story told by someone other than the detective, the author has an easy way of explaining the missing clues: the detective knew about them and their significance, but the narrator didn't.
It's still going to fall into one of the categories of the detective story — a Whodunnit, Whydunnit, Howdunnit or Reverse Howdunnit. The difference is that the audience has no real chance to solve the mystery at all.
For example, Mr. Rich Guy has been killed. Characters A, B and C are established to have motives. Evidence points to characters A, C and also D, who doesn't have a motive but was suspiciously close by at the time of the murder. The real criminal however, is Character Z, who shows up in the last ten minutes as the waiter serving the frustrated police officer his coffee. He hasn't appeared before (or he did, but just for 30 seconds), and he was never considered in the investigation, but the protagonist reveals him as the culprit as the audience wonders what the hell just happened.
Despite normally being an author's ""trademark"" style, Clueless Mysteries often appear in the repertoire of usually-Fair-Play Whodunnit writers, particularly when they get fed up with fans who start complaining that the puzzles are ""too easy"", or when a television mystery gets accused of being formulaic. In these instances, all the usual ingredients for the standard Fair-Play Whodunnit are there. Bizarre murder methods. A nice little inheritance. A family who haven't given birth to a sane individual since the fifteenth century, and lots of clues. But the audience that settles in for its usual clue-hunt is only going to have the rug pulled out from under them in the closing minutes or the last few pages. The clues that they can normally count on mean absolutely nothing. They're all red herrings, and the audience seldom gets any warning that the normal rules are off on holiday. As a one-off, often has the audience applauding and declaring ""Well played, sir/ma'am!"" Use it too often, however, and it's a different story.
The Clueless Mystery is very much a controversial thing. Some people hate them, and will swear off of (or at) any author who serves one up. Other people are quite content with them, as long as they know beforehand that it's not a Fair Play Whodunnit. Done badly, without warning, or under the guise of a Fair Play mystery, it can seem lazy at best, and insulting at worst, as if the writer is mocking the audience in an ""I'm more clever than you!"" kind of way. Done well, it can lend a human side to seemingly-infallible detectives, and reflect the real world, where there isn't necessarily an elaborate rhyme and reason to every crime.
The opposite of a Fair-Play Whodunnit. Has nothing to do with a certain Alicia Silverstone movie. See also Smoking Gun Control, where everything that would normally provide a clue inconveniently doesn't. Contrast Reverse Whodunnit, in which the audience sees the crime as it is committed, complete with identifiable culprit.
When adding examples, please be cautious about adding Fair Play Mysteries that are simply devilishly clever or obscure. If the clues were there, it doesn't matter if they were easy to miss or misinterpret; it's not a Clueless Mystery.
Examples below may contain SPOILERS."
t04010,ColdBloodedTorture,"Torture. Sure, some characters gloat until their victims are rescued. But some gloat and torture at once. And others just get to doing it.
Often shown only by implication, or in its aftereffects (which can be nasty even if the victim survives), for obvious reasons.
In ascending order of reason nastiness, the typical reasons: for information, for punishment, and for pleasure. The punishment may, indeed, be for another character to have to watch or see the results. But others are possible. A Mad Scientist may torture to learn about the victim. Human Sacrifice may call for a particular and gruesome death, and if mere death is too good for some criminal (or alleged criminal), he may be tortured to death. If the person wants to break the victim, this may be a way to force him to say that 2 + Torture = 5, or somehow get the victim to join them.
May be a Fate Worse than Death, calling for a Mercy Kill or I Cannot Self-Terminate when the hero comes upon the victim — the victim is likely to plead for death even if the hero can save him, but the hero is (obviously) prone to override the plea and drag him out of there, if he can. Recovery is likely to be improbably complete.
Heroes torture, sometimes, when they are in a great rush and dire need, and there, the effects tend to be rather unrealistic; in Real Life, torture leaves physical scars and mental trauma, and tends to have poor results in terms of getting reliable and accurate information. If the bad guys don't like getting their hands dirty, they are likely to employ a Torture Technician or Robotic Torture Device to do this for them.
One motive for Better to Die than Be Killed is to avoid this.
Any work that paints The Spanish Inquisition (or their nearest fantasy analogue) as bad guys will often have them engaging in some form of this on people they suspect to be heretics or worse. This general portrayal of the Inquisition is known as the Black Legend.
Compare No-Holds-Barred Beatdown. A ""light"" sci-fi and fantasy equivalent is the Agony Beam... but if the Agony Beam is set to ""Consciousness"" expect unpleasant results. But you never know — sooner or later you may find a victim who likes the frights.

t04085,CombatPragmatist,"Some fights have rules. Most don't. However, a lot of people will still fight as though there are rules.
Heh... suckers.
The Combat Pragmatist is a character who is defined by his or her willingness to do anything in a fight to win.
This typically applies to ""real"" fights where there's actually something at stake that's more important than a cash prize, a trophy, or a title belt, and usually not professional fights in a controlled environment where safeguards are in place to prevent one side from suffering too much damage and where one can be disqualified for not abiding by the rules. In such settings, the Combat Pragmatist is an unsympathetic character (usually the main antagonist) who shows through his ruthlessness that he honors nothing — not his opponents, not the sport and its customs, not the tournament's sacred history — but winning, and tends to believe that there's no such thing as a ""dirty"" fight if your goal is to survive.
These characters are characterized by an extensive knowledge of tactics others may consider ""dirty"" fighting or just by a willingness to use those tactics to achieve their goal, often against more ""honorable"" opponents (i.e. Genre Blind ones). They are likely to think of any adherence to rules or sporting combat as Honor Before Reason.
They do not suffer from a Complexity Addiction, are never afraid to use a Mundane Solution (nor do they need it to be pointed out to them), never assume that the other person will fight ""honorably"", have no interest in a Self-Imposed Challenge, don't care if their opponent is a worthy one, and will not hesitate to Kick Them While They Are Down. They almost always have their weapon of choice either on them or near them at all times, and possibly a spare or two. If not, they're willing to use absolutely anything as a weapon and only resort to Good Old Fisticuffs if there's no weapon nearby.
They will not hesitate to use a Dangerous Forbidden Technique. They have no compunction about hurting a child. Or about attacking someone from behind. Or throwing sand in their eyes. Or pulling down their pants (or flipping up their skirts if dealing with women or a kilt-wearing man). Or the ""Hey, You!"" Haymaker. Or biting them. Or using Weighted Gloves. Or a Groin Attack. Or pretending to surrender. Or... well, you get the idea. However, there can be different levels of this. Even those who don't believe in fighting fair may still have lines they won't cross, such as refusing to kill or not hurting anyone who's not already part of the fight.
Often overlaps with the No-Nonsense Nemesis, Anti Heroes, and especially Ninja. They almost never allow honor or sentiment to cloud their judgement, will usually take measures to avoid setbacks, or betrayal.. Sometimes Weak, but Skilled or Too Clever by Half, though the truly pragmatic former will constantly seek to increase his power level and hence advantage over his enemies. It can look like Confusion Fu in practice — but it almost always isn't. If The Unfettered fights, then he'll be one of these.
This can be an Establishing Character Moment. It can also be divisive, both among the audience and In-Universe, due to Moral Myopia — the hero is a resourceful badass, while the villain is just a dirty cheater. This can lead to instances of Black and Gray Morality, showing that the hero and the villain are Not So Different, and the difference between someone being a terrorist or a freedom fighter. For heroes, it's possible for these tactics, if extreme enough, to lead to What the Hell, Hero? moments or claims of If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him, sometimes resulting in responses of I Did What I Had to Do, and in extreme cases, can be a metaphor for Slowly Slipping Into Evil that represents the start or conclusion of a Face–Heel Turn.
Villains can also be pragmatic, though it usually takes on a different form. Villains being normal Combat Pragmatists is usually averted, or at least not played out completely straight, as it can possibly even lead to them being victorious. If they are, it means they avert Bond Villain Stupidity and actually kill the hero instead of having dinner with him. Depending on the context, using these tactics can be their Kick the Dog moment or even their crossing of the Moral Event Horizon.
Characters are often deliberately not put into this trope due to Rule of Cool. If everyone took this approach to combat who could, key characters would be dead or defeated too soon and the story would be over a little too quickly. Plus, it's often just way cooler to show off more complicated tactics than simple ones. Additionally, Moral Guardians and Media Watchdogs sometimes make having this type of character difficult by ensuring that they can't do certain actions. On the other hand, when drawn-out straight fights are impractical, excitement can be created by Genre Shift away from pure action to espionage, planning, intrigue and the thrill of the hunt, with clever heroes and villains alike who avoid the Idiot Ball and unnecessary flash, and any open violence being quick and decisive, however, this character can come as a Family-Unfriendly Aesop that is right, ""Cheating in a fight with no rules is not cheating"" and ""If you want to defeat the bad guys, you don't have to fight fair with them"". The Obligatory War Crime Scene is a related trope.
On occasion, a Badass Teacher or Cynical Mentor will be this when teaching their mentee to fight, particularly if the mentee is inexperienced, is being trained to literally fight for their life, or at some other extreme disadvantage to 'honorable' opponents. This is more common in literature where fighting is more realistic, so it's harder to downplay a blow received and it's difficult to describe an 'honorable' fight where a disadvantaged opponent would realistically win.
Not to be confused with Why Don't You Just Shoot Him? (although often is a subversion of that trope)."
t04128,ComicallySmallBribe,"Hey, you. Yes you. I'm looking for some... information. What, you can't disclose that? Maybe this shiny new quarter would change your mind...
This is when a character tries to bribe somebody, but the bribe is either pathetically small or involves something of no conceivable value to the recipient. Common reactions include an incredulous stare, dismissive laughter, or even arresting them for attempted bribery. Alternatively, the recipient may enthusiastically accept the bribe, much to the amusement of the audience. (A once-common form of this variant involved Canadians being bribed in American currency, although economics can largely ruin any humor it holds.)
Common variations are:
Sometimes gets inverted; the initial bribe is very large, at least by the standards of the person offering it. The other character refuses it but accepts something comparatively worthless instead, maybe even making the reduced counter-offer themselves. This is more likely to be a dramatic example than the normal way around— typically because the person taking the ""bribe"" has reasons of their own to do what's asked of them, but want to make a statement of some sort with the token payment. A specific example common in the real world is taking a single dollar (or local equivalent) as payment for services rendered; this is done because both sides have to give something in order for a legal contract to exist. Such an absurdly small payment is referred to in legal parlance as a peppercorn, after the rent paid yearly by the Freemasons of Bermuda for their meeting hall: a single peppercorn.
Can also apply to unusually small payments, tips, or demands. Usually Played for Laughs. Contrast Worthless Yellow Rocks, where the characters treat something as being less valuable than it is, rather than more valuable. Compare Not Rare Over There, where something is valuable to someone, but only because they need it and can't find it, Comically Small Demand, and Sold His Soul for a Donut, where someone sells their soul for something comically insignificant."
t04146,ComingOfAgeStory,"A story featuring an adolescent making the mental leap from child to adult. In real life, this happens over the course of several years. Literature, films and some television series are media that have the space to show the story at a slow pace. But for a movie, things have to be compressed to several months at the most, so expect some really accelerated character development. Tends to happen to a character anywhere from 13 to 20 years of age.
Usually includes some combination of the following:
An increasingly popular comedy subversion is the Delayed Coming of Age Story, in which the person has remained mentally a child his entire life and only finally experiences these things sometime between his late 20s and mid-40s.
Mainstream film coming-of-age stories tend toward dramedy. Independent film or novel stories lean toward drama, sometimes jumping headlong into Wangst.
The word bildungsroman (Ger. ""educational novel"") or bildungsgeschichte (Ger. ""educational story"") are sometimes used to describe these kinds of stories. A note on the translation: the terms originated in the Age of Enlightenment, when ""Bildung"" meant not only ""education"" but also ""self-improvement"" (cf. English ""building""). In other words, it's not a ""novel to educate the readers"" but a ""novel about the hero becoming someone"".
See also Age-Progression Song, Ode to Youth."
t04192,CompellingVoice,"Some people are persuasive, some people have even more power than that. Whatever they say, you have to do it. No escape clause, their voice instills immediate obedience. They can tell you to stand on one foot and quack like a duck, to betray your loved one, or to kill yourself, or to just die. If the speaker is of a sadistic turn of mind, they may come up with a more creative Fate Worse than Death to put you through.
The power is most often tied to the voice of the character, but there are a few variations, such as the Jedi Mind Trick. A frequent cause of Brainwashed, Brainwashed and Crazy and creepy Power Perversion Potential. This is usually the main power of an Enthralling Siren. Heroes tend to get Charm Person rather than a Compelling Voice. See also Hypnotic Eyes for a Sister Trope.
Note that this isn't just about voices that are compelling: these are orders that one literally can't disobey, usually for some supernatural reason. A frequent drawback to this power, however, is that it's subject to Literal Mindedness. That is, the listener does what the compeller says, not necessarily what they want.
Hopefully the compeller remembers to figure out a little about the person, or Intrinsic Vows may stop this from working..."
t04222,CompositeCharacter,"Certain media, including Real Life, tend to have the time and space to utilize Loads and Loads of Characters, a large number of individuals with significant and/or necessary contributions to the storyline. But in an adaptation it can be difficult to offer adequate time and space so that each and every character gets their just due for how they impact the story. To be faithful to these characters may, at worst, make them come across as a living Plot Device, existing only for the sake of the plot and not a fleshed out character of their own with individual talents, interests and backstory.
A solution is to invoke artistic license and compress two or more such figures into a single character with traits drawn from all of them. For the sake of telling a proper story those contributions are relegated to the actions of only a few. Instead of showing the legwork of an entire team of intelligence officers to decipher important information, it's rolled up into one person putting it together. Instead of having three different smart guys on the team divided up into distinct fields, you make one of them an Omnidisciplinary Scientist and discard the others. It's a method of streamlining both the plot and the character interactions; there are fewer people to follow and everyone who is still around has more to contribute to the story.
This is frequently done in works Based on a True Story, since no medium can compete with the Loads and Loads of Characters featured in Real Life. Whereas most of humanity's most interesting achievements have involved lots of people with different motivations, it suits the Rule of Drama to simplify things to a handful of characters with well-defined objectives. Though there may be nameless individuals wandering around with their own story to tell, the core plot is dictated by the people with names. Some might object to removing an important character and his or her contribution to the story, but on the other hand it means the story has a chance to be told.
This can sometimes get complicated, as the removed character may have his or her personality split up among the remaining characters (Deadpan Snarker given to character A, TV Genius attributes given to character B), or it is something as simple as someone actually having the removed character's appearance and personality but given a different name. In some extreme cases with certain stories that have regular adaptations every few years, an Era-Specific Personality gives them the opportunity to fuse specific versions of the SAME character in different adaptations, making someone a composite character of him- or herself.
A Massive Multiplayer Crossover might do this to tie the continuities together, by revealing Character A from Series 1 is ""really"" the same person as the similar Character B from Series 2.
Commonly involved in Adaptation Distillation and Adaptation Decay. Adaptation Origin Connection is a subtrope wherein a character important to the series that wasn't involved in the Hero's Origin Story in the original is in the adaptation, replacing a character who usually either got Demoted to Extra or was just a Starter Villain. See also Economy Cast. Sometimes a cause of an Adaptation Personality Change.
The inversion, where an adaptation divides a single character's attributes among multiple characters, is Decomposite Character."
t04366,ContinuityNod,"A Continuity Nod is a reference to some aspect in a series' past or an occurrence within the universe. The nod is not so much a major plot point, but more of a tilt of the hat to the fans that may know these little details. It is a sort of Shout-Out.
In remakes of older TV shows or movies, this may often manifest as a form of Stunt Casting. If characters reference something that's outside the present universe but has special meaning in some other way (such as an Alternate Continuity or adaptation), it's a Mythology Gag. If it's a joke about the actors of the parts, it's Actor Allusion or a Casting Gag. References towards something that's been written out (or Take Thats towards something that people wish were written out) are Discontinuity Nods. A nod that affects the plot in some way can be considered an Chekhov's Boomerang.
Never Live It Down and Remember When You Blew Up a Sun? are Sub Tropes. Oblivious Mockery is also a subtrope when the viewer knows about the action being mocked.
Distinct from a Call-Back, as it does not actually drive any plot development. Here's an example of the difference between the two tropes:
Also distinct from a Call-Forward, as it isn't going to be a plot point later on. If a single scene presents an unusually large number of Continuity Nods, all at once, you may have fallen under a Continuity Cavalcade. If there are so many Continuity Nods that they detract from the story, it's Continuity Porn. When entire scenarios are recreated it becomes an Internal Homage. Naturally contrasts with Series Continuity Error. A Song of Song Titles might have this.
Remember, it's only this if the events happen in the same continuity. Otherwise, it's a Mythology Gag."
t04387,ContrivedCoincidence,"In order to keep a story moving, things need to happen a certain way. Sometimes everything is carefully set up and orchestrated, so that events unfold in an organic, natural fashion. More often than not, though, things happen the way they do simply Because Destiny Says So.
There's just one tiny little problem with that theory: Sometimes, Destiny doesn't say so.
Contrived Coincidence describes a highly improbable occurrence in a story which is required by the plot, but which has absolutely no outward justification — not so much as a character saying There Are No Coincidences. The concept of ""destiny"" is glossed over altogether, and the events in question are simply disguised as mere happenstance. This would be jarring, but most of the time no attention is drawn to the event at all. It's just a narrative convention designed to skip over lots of irrelevant stuff by putting the important events all together, leaving the audience to forget the improbability of the event.
In cases where the coincidence is acknowledged, it's likely a Lampshade Hanging. Unlikely coincidences are bound to happen once in a while. Exceptional things don't happen to the main characters because they are main characters; rather, they are designated main characters because exceptional things happen to them. In other words, there would be no story without this first exceptional coincidence. The earlier in the story the plot-driving coincidences occur, the more leeway the writer has with them.
Contrived Coincidence is one of the driving forces of Farce, decreed by the Rule of Funny. This is a major reason why wariness is needed in other genres; too much of it will make the story farcical.
Make note that like its sister trope Theory of Narrative Causality, this is one of the most pervasive tropes out there. Remember though, that just because a work uses this trope is not an automatic black mark against it. Even the greatest works out there sometimes need a great leap to get the plot to go in an interesting direction.
Too many contrived coincidences may result in One Degree of Separation. For a more grandiose or plot-wrapping version, see Deus ex Machina. A person who is a Weirdness Magnet tends to be a walking contrived coincidence. Often, these can disguise a Gambit Roulette as The Plan. If the story's premise is this trope or relies on it, it's It Began with a Twist of Fate instead. Framing the Guilty Party invokes this trope when the one doing the framing didn't know that party was already guilty.
Super-Trope to Coincidental Broadcast and It's a Small World After All.
Compare with Doom Magnet. See also Fridge Logic (or Not My Driver), for the moment the character realizes this trope."
t04467,CoolOldGuy,"The effectiveness of a cast member is often determined by his distance from the median age of the cast. Deviations up or down will always be coupled with a lack of effectiveness. The Cool Old Guy is an exception to this. At some point, if one character is much older he swings the meter back to 'totally awesome'. In a lot of anime and video games, this makes him somewhere around middle age and the only non-clean shaven guy. Expect him to be greying, a loud voice, but in peak physical condition and unafraid of anything. For reasons that should be clear enough, this trope frequently overlaps with Bald of Awesome.
He usually won't have any special powers but that's only to marginally keep him from intruding on the others' limelight. He usually either has a dated and dramatic but lovable personality or is a complete no-nonsense hardass, depending on how the other characters act.
In Japan, this trope is called the Oyaji, written 親父 or オヤジ, which means ""daddy"". Can often stray into Even the Guys Want Him or Stupid Sexy Flanders territory. Wise Beyond Their Years is a younger version (usually no younger than late 20s at minimum) that has many of the same characteristics.



See also: Old Master, Older Sidekick, Eccentric Mentor, The Mentor, Dirty Old Man, Evil Old Folks, Token Adult. See Cool Old Lady for the Distaff Counterpart. Contrast Grumpy Old Man."
t04468,CoolOldLady,"Much like its Spear Counterpart the Cool Old Guy, the Cool Old Lady is a character that's much older than the main cast but for whatever reason, they become deeply attached to her. She can be a ""hip"" grandma that rollerblades, bungee jumps, can speak the teenage slang without it coming across as Totally Radical, an Apron Matron who's gruff but caring, or a Cloudcuckoo Lander who is a joy to have around. Or she could be a kindly old lady who obviously led a very rich life (when she was younger, she bungee jumped, rode a motorcycle, knows the teenage slang of her era but doesn't dare try to incorporate it into her current speech) and regales the cast with saucy stories of her escapades. The fact that she's survived doing all that and lived to that age tells you that you should Never Mess with Granny.
If the grandma did all the cool stuff in the past, expect her to be low on the Sorting Algorithm of Mortality; on more dramatic shows, she will die by episode's/story arc's end. Often, she is helping all her new younger friends come to terms with their grief rather while being rather at peace with it herself because she ""led a good life"".
See also My Grandma Can Do Better Than You: For when Grandma is not so cool, and this fact is used to insult someone else by implying they are even worse.
Compare Mrs. Claus. Not to be confused with My Old Lady, a film starring Kevin Kline."
t04477,CoolSword,"There is something a sword has that other weapons don't. It could be that it is an Elegant Weapon for a More Civilized Age, or perhaps it's because sword fights just look so impossibly cool. Often Heroes Prefer Swords.
These weapons even come in multiple categories:
Sometimes the sword is especially special because:
This trope is Older Than Feudalism, because the sword is a very, very old weapon and there are tons of examples from mythology. Possibly the most iconic Cool Sword of all is Excalibur, the sword the Lady in the Lake gave to King Arthur (which supposedly wasn't the original Sword in the Stone).
And no, having a sword is not (necessarily) Compensating for Something.
Recording the sheer number of characters who use swords in media would make for a VERY long trope. Basically, name any hero from a Heroic Fantasy series or an RPG (of any genre), and chances are he'll be using a sword. Thus, this trope should be reserved for cool swords; those with some exceptional quality, name, or power. Not just any old sword will do.
Compare its Gun Counterpart, Cool Guns. For swords that aren't fantastically and impractically cool, see our Useful Notes: Swords page. Oddly Shaped Sword is the Sub-Trope for swords that have a really weird shape."
t04514,CorruptChurch,"Not even the most religious of places are safe from evil. In fact, the Corrupt Church is often portrayed as much worse than a simple Supervillain Lair or secular League Of Evil, because when even holy priests and ministers turn to the dark side, they can psychologically manipulate the masses with mere superstition, so what hope is there for society? Tends to be highly influential over political leaders to stress the church's power over everyone.
Major villains from the Corrupt Church can include Sinister Ministers, heresy-crushing Inquisitors and other typical ambitious villains using a convenient power structure for their own ends. The Creepy Cathedral tends to be their base of operations. If a work is set in the modern day, then the leader of the Corrupt Church will often be a televangelist, in which case the ""straw Christian conservative"" aspects will be ratcheted Up to Eleven. The Strawman Conservative may be a member, or even a leader, in one of these.
If the Corrupt Church is used for satire, the Crystal Dragon Jesus might appear.
Distinct from the Path of Inspiration and Scam Religion because the Corrupt Church actually started out as a legitimate religion but has Gone Horribly Wrong. Unlike the Religion of Evil, an openly evil religion, the teachings may still be sound, and there may be good-hearted people in it yet — usually laity or low-ranking clergy, even a Good Shepherd — though neither of these can be counted on.
Compare with the Cult. Contrast with the Saintly Church. Can potentially overlap with Church Militant, if the church is both evil and badass.
Whilst, there have been (many) corrupt clerics and callous doctrines throughout history, No Real Life Examples, Please! Every religion (or lack thereof) will have both defenders and detractors somewhere out there.
And remember - somewhere, your local deity is Face Palming."
t04515,CorruptCorporateExecutive,"A senior manager, CEO or owner of a major definitely-for-profit corporation who is out to make as much money and gain as much power as possible, by any means available, regardless of who suffers. To that end, they are perfectly willing to violate business or social ethics, commit crimes (ranging from fraudulent accounting to mass murder), and devastate Mother Nature and human communities, justifying those actions under the name of ""just business."" They are confident that all they have to do is spread enough money around to get their way or avoid punishment, and are very likely to cross the Moral Event Horizon and/or become The Unfettered in their search for profit. They are also very, very likely to be White (or Asian) and male, like CEOs in real life.
Expect to find them at the head of an enormous boardroom table on the top floor of an Evil Tower of Ominousness. He may be a Bad Boss, but not always. A few of them can actually be very decent employers, with employees who are completely in the dark about their underhanded plans. If so, the public is often just as much in the dark. Naturally, this sort of villain tends to have an Amoral Attorney (or several) on his payroll, in case he does slip up, and a small stormtrooper army of ""security personnel"" who have carte blanche to commit any number and kind of violent crimes to get a good performance evaluation from the boss. If those resources fail, he often uses money to ""buy"" or even ""own"" officials.
They usually fail to consider the full effects of their plan, or the fact that they can make more by going legit, and at times the plan seems to have no concrete way of creating wealth. Usually, they remain in business thanks to Offscreen Villain Dark Matter.
Though there are earlier examples, the modern Corrupt Corporate Executive had (until relatively recently) a distinctly The '80s feel, which made him seem progressively more out of place as those affectations become less mainstream. Earlier Corrupt Corporate Executives tended to be far less stylized and distinct from other ""smooth"" villain types (often with a healthy streak of Blofeld). However, over the past decade, countless high profile real-life cases of corporate corruption have arguably diminished the '80s feel of the character and made the Corrupt Corporate Executive a very modern villain.
A well-known variation of the CCE, which is popular in dystopian and Cyber Punk fiction, is the CEO or President of a megacorporation that produces and controls everything (even the authorities) and is the de facto ruler of the world.
Another variation of the CCE is the Robber Baron, a pre-80s, industrial revolution era manifestation that retains all of the CCE's cosmopolitan, far-reaching financial and political power, with perhaps even less governmental or media constraints to consider. Joseph Pulitzer, from the movie Newsies, is a perfect example of this subtrope. The Robber Baron will have a different wardrobe and jargon than the 80s CCE, as appropriate to his setting, but is otherwise indistinguishable.
Another variation on the CCE, found mostly in Walking the Earth series, is basically a Corrupt Hick with a business. The ""corporations"" they represent are not major multinational conglomerates, but small businesses like trucking companies, hotels, or other ""mom and pop"" ventures that simply want their competitors out of action. They tend to have little power outside of a single town or county, but can usually amass a small army of redneckish goons and threaten violence with impunity by virtue of paying off local law enforcement and/or the judiciary. This flavor of Corrupt Corporate Executive favors harassing a competing store owned by a kindly old man/woman and/or their family.
This is one of the inevitable progressions that any ambitious character will end in. See Also There Are No Good Executives and Morally Bankrupt Banker. Occasionally, the CCE will be the producer of an Immoral Reality Show.
Compare Greedy Jew and Pointy-Haired Boss. Contrast Honest Corporate Executive, the CCE's natural enemy. And remember that (1) Even Evil Has Standards, and (2) Even Evil Has Loved Ones, especially in a What You Are in the Dark situation.
Sadly, this too is Truth in Television. Be that as it may, No Real Life Examples, Please!"
t04605,CoversAlwaysLie,"Don't judge a book by its cover - no, literally. Nor a video, a comic, or even a record. The cover is an essential part of the marketing plan. As is common in marketing, it can be an entirely inaccurate representation. It's not just the artwork that's misleading, either. The Blurb on the back may be even more disconnected from the story.
Popular characters who appear in little more than a cameo on the inside can be larger than the main character on the cover. A quiet, contemplative issue can be made to seem like an action-packed frag-fest, and vice-versa. The cover can push for an entirely different demographic than the rest of the work. This is often done intentionally so customers will purchase the product assuming that it relates to their interests in a visual version of Follow the Leader, as commonly found in The Mockbuster.
Film Posters and video packaging are particularly likely to mislead if it's an independent film, or a film in a genre that the marketing people assume most people are unlikely to appreciate. For example, an intelligently-written mystery for the whole family may have a cover that implies it's a comedy, or a family film that happens to have a dog in it may emphasize the dog on the cover. See also Never Trust a Trailer.
In non-graphic literature, it is not uncommon for a female character to be portrayed in a Stripperiffic outfit when they would wear nothing of the sort in the story. Also, virtually any Speculative Fiction book will have either a rocket or an alien of some sort on the cover, and dragons are commonly used on Fantasy, High Fantasy and Sword  Sorcery books, even if there is no dragon in the story at all. (Frank Frazetta and Boris Vallejo are particularly noteworthy as artists whose paintings make great book covers, but only occasionally actually relate to the contents of the books.)
This trope also applies to album covers, especially singles, which often get their own album art, for one or two songs.
The chances of this happening are magnified many times over when the game has to jump the national boundary. Especially in the pre-internet era, it wasn't at all uncommon to see the localization team (who may not actually be all that familiar with the work in question) creating a new cover from wholecloth, and said cover had about a 50-50 shot of looking nothing whatsoever like the actual product.
A related subtrope is the practice of creating the cover first, and writing the story based on that. This was common practice for comic books, especially at DC, during The Silver Age of Comic Books under editor Julius Schwartz, and was responsible for some of the weirdest stories of the time. However, it would sometimes result in a story that went off in a totally different direction and disposed of the cover situation in a panel or two. The website Superdickery features many strange, silly and inane covers of this kind.
Finally, in some cases, it may result from using stuff that was never meant to be a cover. A classic example is concept art, which can end up way off-base from the final product, but still look nice enough and roughly similar enough to be pressed into service as such.
This has occasionally gotten lampshade hung on it, as evidenced here◊, here and here.
Many of these overlap with Sexy Packaging and Contemptible Cover, and often feature Lady Not-Appearing-in-This-Game. Compare with Never Trust a Trailer, Wolverine Publicity, Bait-and-Switch Credits and Super Dickery, and enjoy this i09 gallery.
For cover illustrations that whiten dark-skinned characters, see Race Lift. For in-book illustrations, see Unreliable Illustrator. For magazines that sometimes put a bit of skin on their cover even though the interior is about gaming, sports, or whatever, see Fanservice Cover.
Inverted Trope of Spoiler Cover, where the cover is so accurate that it gives away important points.
Note: Covers lie a LOT. It happens all the time, even if only to prevent spoilers. So only put really interesting examples here now, not every cover that tells a little fib."
t04651,CrapsackWorld,"A Crapsack World is a horrible setting where the jaded notion of ""anything that can go wrong will go horribly wrong"" almost always applies, and it corrupts its inhabitants into perpetuating that nastiness against each other. More succinctly, trying to survive in one of these places is gonna suck.
Although there are countless ways Crapsack Worlds can be depicted (often with Scenery Gorn), it is usually dark, and on the cynical end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism, so it will have either Grey and Gray Morality or Black and Gray Morality, if not outright Evil vs. Evil in the worst of cases (beware of Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy if you decide to go this route though). Settings like these are not kind at all to idealists, who usually get traumatized and/or die horribly when their attempts to change the world through idealism meet tragic ends.
Heroes in this setting are usually Anti Heroes, and often have at least a bit of the Deadpan Snarker about them. Being good will suck, and if there are genuinely good heroes in this setting, expect them to be Knights In Sour Armor and/or Hurting Heroes—more idealistic heroes such as the Knight in Shining Armor tend to not last long in this kind of setting. Any victories they manage to win over the forces of this world are likely to be Pyrrhic in nature.
Villains tend to run the gamut from sympathetic Anti Villains (on any level of the Sliding Scale of Anti-Villains) right down to the most horrific monsters to grace any kind of media. Truly awful villains are especially common in these kinds of settings, both to represent the misery of the setting in general and to give the Anti-Hero someone to whom he can look good in comparison. In truly extreme cases, even the most popular or powerful of these monsters suffer just as badly as everyone else. And Anyone Can Die.
From here, these worlds can be depicted by authors in various ways, whether it would be dramatic or comedic, immutable or mutable. Though most of the time immutable equals dramatic, it is possible to see combinations between these categories.
This kind of world often occurs After the End. Wretched Hive and City Noir are city-sized versions of the Crapsack World. A Dystopia is a speculative Crapsack World ruled by repressive forces modeled after real-life politics. A Teenage Wasteland is a Crapsack World run by kids. If the Crapsack World's continued misery is caused by supernatural forces, see Dark Fantasy, Hell on Earth and Cosmic Horror Story.
If a Sugar Bowl (usually the antithesis of this trope) turns out to be one of these under the surface, then you have yourself a Crapsaccharine World. If the people who live in the Crapsack World don't realise or pretend it isn't a horrible place to be in, it is a False Utopia. A Villain World or Death World is likely to be this, and Bad Future is a Sub-Trope. Someone who just thinks the world they inhabit is this is a Cynic or a Straw Nihilist (or a Grumpy Bear, if he lives in a pretty nice world).
For worlds that are almost literal sacks of crap see The Dung Ages. See You Would Not Want to Live in Dex for other crapsack environments. On a less negative note, the World of Badass will also be likely to have elements of the Crapsack World, to give justification on why kicking ass is very important to survival. Compare World of Jerkass, a world which is only unpleasant because all of the characters are horrible people.
This trope is also known as World Half Empty, for the expression of pessimism being a state of seeing a glass with half the amount of water in it as being ""half empty"". Also, a half-empty glass means it can only be emptied, and can't be refilled. It represents hopelessness and inevitable doom, fitting this trope perfectly. By definition, contrast A World Half Full. C.T. Phipps talks about some of the appeal to the concept here. The Appeal of Grimdark.
No Real Life Examples, Please! This is a metaphysical trope that's clearly defined by the writer, not an opinion by people complaining about the world as a whole (localized places that are very horrible in Real Life should perhaps go to Wretched Hive and other non-metaphysical tropes instead).
Also, do not use this page to complain about worlds you don't like. If you have to say ""This troper thinks"" or ""Arguably,"" it doesn't belong here."
t04723,CreepyChild,"They look sweet, innocent, even angelic, but there's something not quite right about them. They're too calm, too knowing. They aren't really children any longer, not at heart.
Children should be innocent and in need of adult protection. By inverting this, the trope arouses deep-rooted fears. The Creepy Child might not be physically dangerous, but their profound unnaturalness is just as chilling.
Creepy children are frequently female, and often Emotionless Girls. They can be, among other things, a Robot Girl, an Oracular Urchin, a changeling, a Waif Prophet, or Evil. As prophets, they emanate otherworldliness; as heroes, they may elicit distrust and contempt from the rest of The Team sans the one female who wants to be surrogate mother, and as villains they remain cute even while the bodies pile up around them. They usually have an Ironic Nursery Tune theme.
May be holding a Creepy Doll. A girl wearing an Ethereal White Dress is usually the Creepy Child. If a Creepy Child is shown drawing, it will usually be a Nightmare Fuel Coloring Book.
Compare and contrast Psychopathic Manchild and the usually much more proactive and physically dangerous Enfant Terrible. See also Undead Child and Ambiguous Innocence. Also compare Creepy Cute."
t04831,CruelAndUnusualDeath,"Some people die of old age, or gradually succumb to one of a number of illnesses. When death comes, the lucky among us will go out peacefully with dignity. Some of us might go out fighting the good fight, saving the lives of some unfortunate person whom our consciences cannot ignore and force us to help. They'll all die ""good deaths"" (and in some cases, heroic deaths).
This trope is not about those people.
Some deaths not only suck, they suck beyond the telling of it. The extremely painful and particularly gruesome, morbidly embarrassing deaths that leave the deceased absolutely no chance to retain any sort of dignity, forever. Deaths that transcend from being merely ""bad"" into the realm of being ""ugly.""
This trope isn't about just any unpleasant death. Sure, it's bad to get shot in the head...your blood spills all over the floor and you may void your bladder or your bowels. But compared to... oh, being eaten alive from the inside out, getting shot is a walk in the park. It is worth noting that for the most part, creators reserve these events for use as villainous karmic deaths (where the level of horror involved with the death is often part of the karmic punishment) and to get rid of unpleasant people who are Hoist by Their Own Petards... especially the embarrassing type. If this is done to a sympathetic character, on the other hand, it is usually the point where the killer crosses the Moral Event Horizon, if he or she is not on the other side of it already. If they do this on a regular basis, chances are they're a Complete Monster.
There isn't necessarily a correlation between the visible gruesomeness of the death and the actual nature of the character's death, some deaths that fall under this trope happen offscreen, and it's the very idea of it that makes it horrific. Deaths with a high horrible factor with less visible content can just as easily fall into scary, though.
Deaths like this tend to fall into two categories: The first one is where the victim is a rather sadistic villain who deserves it, who you really aren't going to feel sorry for (well, maybe a little...). The second one is where the killer fits that description, and the intent is to show the viewers how sadistic they are (more often than not, it's convincing). Occasionally, the two situations happen in the same work of fiction, with the killer in the second type becoming a victim in the first, which is very much a Karmic Death.
Warning: The following contains some serious Nightmare Fuel and Nausea Fuel, with a liberal dosage of Squick. Read at your own risk."
t04924,CurbStompBattle,"A fight that's extremely one-sided, where one side just absolutely trashes the other with little-to-no effort. Commonly used as a way of establishing a character as being very strong, especially if the person on the receiving end of the beating is known for being very rough and tough.
The name comes from the act of forcing someone to lie down in the street and bite the curb, then stomping on the back of his or her head. This could be very humiliating to him or her, especially if he or she were to die. Even if he or she were to survive, they may be missing some teeth and have a severely broken jaw.
Sometimes, this is played for humor; other times, it tends to be a Moment of Awesome.
Sometimes, it actually makes sense by the logic of the story, but writers use Third Act Stupidity to avert it.
Compare Pendulum War, which is where sides take turns to perform this trope upon each other. In Professional Wrestling this frequently overlaps with Squash Match. In video games, see Flawless Victory. Breather Bosses, Zero-Effort Bosses and Anticlimax Bosses are the types most likely to be on the receiving end of a Curb-Stomp Battle. If this is done to the heroes, on the other hand, it becomes a Hopeless Boss Fight, often from a Hero Killer. Compare No-Sell. Contrast Story-Breaker Team-Up. If the curbstompee manages to get a few good hits in to show that he or she is not totally helpless, it's a Curb Stomp Cushion. A No-Holds-Barred Beatdown is similar but much more realistic, brutal, and violent.
One-Hit Kill is a subtrope that's Exactly What It Says on the Tin. A subtrope for elections is Landslide Election. There Is No Kill Like Overkill is often the result of a Curb-Stomp Battle. Often paired with The Worf Effect, which it amplifies."
t05038,DaddysGirl,"The daughter adores the father-figure and at times the mother (if there is one) feels left out. The daughter is usually either a single child or the only girl in the family. Likewise she's often the father's favorite. In extreme instances, this can be Wife Husbandry or result in the daughter becoming obsessed with her father to the point of Electra Complex.
Due to their close contact to the male parent, Daddys' Girls can sometimes acquire boyish traits and interests at odds with expected female personality types like One of the Boys. On the opposite end of the spectrum, she might be especially girly like his sweet little princess. The third possible character is the socially awkward one who gets understanding and encouragement from her father. Naturally, any girl who looks up to her father this much wants to follow in his footsteps, thus Never a Self-Made Woman. At times, the girl can also end up as a Bratty Teenage Daughter (or Spoiled Brat if the father is rich).
In the likely chance that she has a younger brother, she is very protective of him. Daddy is typically very protective of his girl as well, ranging from Twerp Sweating potential suitors to going full Papa Wolf on men who wrong her.
If the family consists of a girl, a boy, a mother and a father, the girl will most likely be Daddy's Girl and the boy will be a Momma's Boy, causing conflict in the entire family. If the Daddy's Girl acquires a stepmother, there will most likely be tension between the two, as one (or each) will be jealous of the other and the woman will either become or be seen as a Wicked Stepmother.
It's the flip-side of Even Bad Men Love Their Mamas and Momma's Boy. Often associated with Lineage Comes from the Father.
Compare Daddy's Little Villain."
t05109,DarkAndTroubledPast,"Something terrible happened to a character; some tragic event in their past that shaped a fundamental level of their personality. Long after the event is over, it still has a powerful influence on the character's life.
Expect to see the above overlap for extra Angst or Wangst.
This is a stock Backstory for a character. Much like a Mysterious Past, except more tragic and troubled. Don't expect it to be revealed all at once, or sometimes at all. It usually gets revealed in small doses through a Troubled Backstory Flashback as the story progresses; possibly in a Flashback Nightmare where a happy memory transforms into a slaughter. Often used as a Freudian Excuse for an asocial character's Jerkass tendencies or quiet stoicism. Still, it is understandable that the character wants to keep it secret because They're Called ""Personal Issues"" for a Reason, after all.
This can lead to either becoming an Anti-Hero or Hurting Hero. For villains, this is a Start of Darkness. Especially blatant cases of this trope will result in the character being seen as a Sympathetic Sue.
Female characters with a Dark and Troubled Past include the Dark Magical Girl and the Broken Bird. Male characters with a Dark and Troubled Past are instant bait for the Estrogen Brigade who have bought him leather pants. Expect all nearby female characters to become afflicted with attraction to his Troubled, but Cute appeal, and try to help him heal his heart. Not happening. Or maybe it will?
The step-up of this trope is the Dysfunction Junction, where the whole cast will have one of these and suffer from it, too (and don't expect them to get better). If the afflicted character is in a law enforcement profession, see Standard Cop Backstory. When paired with a Nice Guy or gal with a happy upbringing, you can expect...interesting results. See Deus Angst Machina."
t05112,DarkerAndEdgier,"A Tone Shift that seeks to make a work of fiction more serious, cynical or gritty.
In theory, this means that archetypes which we are accustomed to see acting in a more noble setting will have to act in one where they must think and act grimly in order to make progress, thus forcing re-examination of the tropes involved, or the use of new tropes and expansion of the setting, utilizing different sorts of characters and stories. In practice, however, writers can be too lazy to realize all that potential and end up randomly ""spicing up"" a work with gratuitous gore, cursing, and sex to make it more ""adult"" — often overdoing it in the process. This is not to be confused with Tough Love.
When done right, Darker and Edgier works are a case of Tropes Are Not Bad. When a show uses this trope as a tagline, you can expect a mixture of: awful things happening to the characters, twisted backstories giving them a reason to angst, good and bad becoming less obvious, and the setting becoming much bleaker. However, this all works IF it's done right.
As one could predict, this is fairly easy to screw up and poor use of these tropes may just result in Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy if the setting gets too depressing or Narm if the edginess becomes just silly. This doesn't make it a bad trope though— when this is used subtly such as in the Harry Potter series it can create the effect of a series growing up with its audience.
In fact this is often the purpose of a Darker and Edgier turn. Just as a Lighter and Softer tone is typically part of an attempt to bring a fictional world to children or to younger children, a ""darker"" tone is often intended to make a setting appeal to older children or adults. But unlike its opposite, a Darker And Edgier shift is often intended not to reach a new audience, but rather to keep an existing audience as it grows up. It can also be a result of child fans growing up, Running the Asylum as Promoted Fanboys, and continuing to think of the setting as something aimed at themselves and their peers instead of the original target age group.
This trope became extremely popular in Comic Books as a rebellion against the Silver Age but also led to more than a decade of clumsy attempts to show that comics are ""not kid stuff anymore."" See the Bronze Age, the Dark Age, and '90s Anti-Hero for more details about how this worked.
The excessive version is often known as ""Grimdark"" (one word), derived from the tagline of Warhammer 40,000. (""In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war."") Sometimes justified with the phrase ""Silly Rabbit, Idealism Is for Kids!"". Usually shows up in Dark Fic. If a pre-existing show undergoes a Retool under the guise of making things Darker And Edgier, expect Jumping the Shark, especially if there was Executive Meddling involved. The United Federation of Charles wrote an essay called, What is Grimdark? which explains some of the history of the subject. ""Grimderp"" has in many parts of the Net become popular as a term for Grimdark that goes so far that it becomes Narm. When a specific character rather than the work as a whole is perceived as having become excessively Darker And Edgier, a popular term is ""Edgelord"". Which also gets applied to fanfic writers who produce exclusively Grimdark (or especially Grimderp) works. Future writers beware! Using this trope without knowing when to stop is a quick road to Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy.
As with Lighter and Softer, this practice tends to go better if the change was planned in advance to keep the tone from shifting too abruptly.
Note that this is not the same as a Deconstruction. A Deconstruction plays out the genre's conventions to their logical conclusions in order to criticize the initial genre conventions. This does not have to be dark (see for instance Deconstructive Parody) and it doesn't prevent things from turning out well. Darker And Edgier just adds ""dark"" elements to try and get the same effect. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but often a Deconstruction can cause a work to seem darker because it's calling attention to dark aspects already implied but previously glossed over; see also Ascended Fridge Horror.
Opposite of Lighter and Softer, Younger and Hipper, Denser and Wackier and Revisiting the Roots. Often found alongside Bloodier and Gorier, Hotter and Sexier, Obligatory Swearing, Sequel Logo in Ruins, and Real Is Brown. Often a by-product of the franchise growing bigger and more epic.
Compare Grimmification and Fractured Fairy Tale for when this is done with fairy tales and American Kirby Is Hardcore for when this is done with boxart. See also Sugar Apocalypse, and Cerebus Syndrome. For when it applies to a single episode, see Unexpectedly Dark Episode."
t05121,DarkIsNotEvil,"So, you have a race of people who all have black, leathery wings. They're born with the ability to shoot black, shadowy globs out of their hands. Also, they prefer the night, and let's not get started on their wardrobes. Surely, they're evil!
Well...no one actually mentioned them doing bad things; in fact, they may actually be pretty good guys. It's not like they keep pet dogs exclusively for kicking. Despite any images that may have been burned into our minds, creepy appearances and killing people actually don't have much to do with each other. Unfortunately, however, people can still judge them based on their looks. Expect some Van Helsing Hate Crimes to be committed, especially by dickish Knight Templars rambling about light who may be worse than those they persecute.
This trope can be a subversion or aversion of several other tropes depending on how it's played, including Beauty = Goodness, Always Chaotic Evil, and Colour-Coded for Your Convenience. A common use for it is for the ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" Aesop. It can also be used to promote Evil Is Cool and Evil Is Sexy, and sometimes Even Evil Has Standards, except without the, uh... evil. Even though with the subtle (or not so) undertone of Humans Are Bastards that this trope implies, using this does not automatically enforce Light Is Not Good; in fact, stories where Light Is Good and Dark Is Not Evil are quite common.
The extreme form of this is The Sacred Darkness, where Dark is not just not Evil, but is in fact equally holy and Good as Light (or even more so) is typically perceived to be. In situations where The Sacred Darkness exists, however, Dark Is Not Evil is not an absolute certainty, and the usual caveats about Light Is Not Good still apply.
Light Is Not Good, Good Powers, Bad People are sister tropes. For the inverse, see Dark Is Evil. A natural implication of the Yin-Yang Bomb. See also Good All Along, Bad Powers, Good People, Creepy Good, Face of a Thug, Terror Hero, Perky Goth, Our Monsters Are Different, Anti-Antichrist, Reluctant Monster, Good Is Not Nice, and Halloweentown. When vampires are involved, this trope generally puts them on the friendly end of the Sliding Scale of Vampire Friendliness, often resulting in a Friendly Neighbourhood Vampire. Gods of the underworld and death in particular can be this, since Everybody Hates Hades.
Contrast Evil Wears Black."
t05194,DeadGuyJunior,"If you need a name for your new baby, ask yourself, ""Have any of my loved ones died?"" If so, look no further: renew, reuse, recycle!
The concept of naming the next generation to honour the originals has a number of enticing benefits for writers. Firstly, it saves them the effort of thinking up a whole new name. Secondly, it pays lip service to dead characters, and thus has the valuable effect not only of creating a walking plot reminder but of making audiences go, ""Awwwwww! He remembered his dead [insert role here]!""
It can be done well, especially if the background culture is one in which it's a common practice (Victorian Britain, for example). In another case of Truth in Television, some people did and still do simply have a custom of naming new children after beloved deceased friends or relatives. If that context isn't there, though, it runs the high risk of coming off as corny. Especially if there's more than one namesake running around, and they had just the right number of kids...
For kids who are just like their parents, but not necessarily named the same, see Generation Xerox. A Bittersweet Ending may manifest this in Babies Ever After.
Often happens after Someone to Remember Him By. May also result from a Child Naming Request. The child may inquire about the dead person as in Tell Me About My Father.
Compare Birth/Death Juxtaposition, We Named the Monkey ""Jack"". Sister trope of Legacy Vessel Naming. This is one way of averting One Steve Limit."
t05235,DeadpanSnarker,"A character prone to gnomic, sarcastic, sometimes bitter, occasionally whimsical asides. They can vary wildly from rare, funny one-liners to complete obnoxiousness.
The Deadpan Snarker note ""Snark"" = portmanteau of ""snide"" and ""remark"" exists to deflate pomposity, point out the unlikelihood of certain plans, and deliver funny lines. Typically the most cynical supporting character. In most cases, it is implied that the snarker would make a good leader, strategist, or consultant given their ability to instantly see the flaws in a constructed plan. More often than not, their innate snarkiness is the only thing preventing the other characters from comprehending this for themselves. In other cases, the Deadpan Snarker resorts to sarcasm because they're the Only Sane Man. Tends to be shot a Death Glare when they go too far (and probably isn't without one of their own, either). Note that due to the definition evolving, the ""Deadpan"" part of the title has gradually become The Artifact and a deadpan delivery is no longer a necessary part of the trope.
Sometimes the Deadpan Snarker is shown to be incapable of avoiding sarcasm, due to his insecurity about expressing any genuine thought or feeling, and his fear of withdrawing from the cynical position and protection. This may turn him into a Stepford Snarker.
While the Snarker has existed (in both fiction and Real Life) since time immemorial, its most contemporary incarnation emerged in the early 1930s with the new popularity of sound cinema and the rise of ""zinger"" comedy. In fact, it was in 1933 that the word ""wisecrack"" (the Snarker's most trusted sidearm) entered English-language dictionaries. (And, in a stroke of genius, the word ""wisecrack"" is itself a wisecrack, carrying the sarcastic connotation of ""Oh, yeah, you're a real Socrates, smart guy."")
A sub-trope of this is Grade System Snark. Compare The Snark Knight, Little Miss Snarker, Cuckoosnarker, Weasel Mascot, The Mean Brit, First-Person Smartass, Servile Snarker, Gentleman Snarker, Silent Snarker, Disabled Snarker. See also Snark Bait, Non-Action Snarker, Snarky Nonhuman Sidekick, Cats Are Snarkers, Tall, Dark, and Snarky, Surrounded by Idiots, and Sarcastic Devotee. Sometimes overlaps with Genre Savvy and No Sense of Humor. A common role for a Straight Man. May wear Jade-Colored Glasses. Expect them to resort frequently to Brutal Honesty. If there are too many of these, you might be in a World of Snark. Overdoing it on one character may result in a Jerkass. Expect plenty of Snark-to-Snark Combat if and when two of these meet. May result in Offing the Mouth. Try not to confuse the dialogue with Buffy Speak. It's common among narrators, making them into a Lemony Narrator.
Now, as for real life examples...  Oh, yeah, right. Someone up there has got no sense of humour."
t05249,DealWithTheDevil,"You know how it works. Want to be a millionaire, Take Over the World, gain infinite power, or just to get back at that obnoxious Jerk Jock? Well, mosey on down to those crossroads and Mr. S will guarantee your wildest dreams, if you just sign on the dotted line with your own blood. This trope is Older Than Steam, and does not even require the Abrahamic Devil; any trickster, demon, or evil deity roughly equivalent to Satan can be used. It reached its current version in the 16th-century legend of Faust selling his soul to Mephistopheles (who technically isn't quite exactly Satan, but still a high-ranking demon).
This trope includes both literal Magically Binding Contracts with a literal devil, and crooked deals between any corrupt exploiter (the Mephistopheles role) and a desperate pawn (the Faust role). The exploiter can be offering anything from some shiny new Applied Phlebotinum to making a high school nerd popular, to saving your life moments before death. Sometimes it has no practical value whatsoever. But whatever the service, whatever the offer, there is always a price. This price can be anything — the Faust's soul, their conscience, their firstborn, their loved ones, their voice, their eternal servitude, or even something that seems completely innocent — but whatever the price, it's something that will render the Faust a lot worse off when it is paid, if not bring them to complete ruin.
Note that actual devils will always follow through with their end, even if their end is a sinister bastardization of the terms. Thus always remember to Read the Fine Print and have an experience in law with you if you try to do this. We never see Mephistopheles simply take the soul and run like an amateur scammer; he gave his word, narrated the fine print, put his name on the dotted line and made the wish come true. As icing on the cake, the Mephistopheles sometimes makes sure or just shows in reality that the gift is, in itself, detrimental to the life of the Faust and others around him in the first place — especially if there's a chance at irony, where lacking their ""soul"", the element they gave up as payment, ultimately makes the gift worthless. The character who offers the deal is often, though not always, The Corrupter (and not all Corrupters use this as a tactic).
An alternate form is a deal where the Mephistopheles offers the Faust exactly what he wants, if not more, but to get it, he has to undergo an Impossible Task that Mephistopheles obviously does not think the Faust can complete, with the Faust's soul as the penalty if he fails. In such occasions they can escape the Devil's trap. Alternately, the deal truly has no strings attached, as it's a Xanatos Gambit where the Faust's good fortune or success will deliver the soul of another to Mephistopheles.
Whether God or the equivalent would be interested in a soul that someone has gambled is the Elephant in the Living Room.
Deal With The Devil plots can overlap with What an Idiot!, as smart and rational people know to stay well the hell away from deals like these. Some writers try to defend the Faust by turning the deal into a Leonine Contract - either the deal was made when the Faust was in desperate straits or under some kind of duress, or the Mephistopheles made the offer when the victim had no time to think (e.g., offering to save him from the Death Trap in return for something nasty). Others make the contract so long, complex and filled with Latin-esque legal jargon that no one will Read the Fine Print (Sloth is a very undervalued sin). Also expect Exact Words and You Didn't Ask to be employed against the Faust.
If you should find yourself suckered into a Deal With The Devil, The Power of Love may be your best bet at defeating the infernal contract. Or you can try your luck (literally) with a Jury of the Damned. Some Guile Heroes can make it into a Meaningless Villain Victory. With enough power, a Faustian Rebellion is possible.
Common solutions (which often cause a Wishplosion) are:
Of course, the devil has been in this business since day seven. Therefore, the only way the villain of the piece can expect to get out of the ""accounts receivable"" column is by getting moved into the ""owner's equity"" column.
Power at a Price is the supertrope. Devil's Job Offer and Sold His Soul for a Donut are subtropes.
Compare Bargain with Heaven, the Inversion of this trope largely forgotten in the mainstream, but still very much in use in some contexts. Compare also Reasoning with God. For the occasions when the Devil comes out behind, see Did You Just Scam Cthulhu?. See also Evil Is Not a Toy, which this trope can overlap with."
t05262,DeathByChildbirth,"Parental Abandonment occurs with an overwhelming frequency in fiction. On top of that, an overwhelming number of victims lose their mothers during childbirth. So sad, so tragic, so heart-wrenching...such a goldmine of a plot device. Nothing impossible about it, but the statistics are ridiculously high, especially for any industrialized nations (although, as Jane Austen observed, it was used ridiculously often even before modern medicine).
May be used to set up a tense family situation where the father or older siblings unreasonably blame the youngest for ""murdering their mother"" and turn him/her into The Un-Favourite.
In fact, the use of it as a plot device might be Older Than Feudalism, since unless his mother died in childbirth, the protagonist could be burdened with at least six siblings.
Notably, in fiction the mother might not stand a chance of living through the childbirth owing to the nature of the child's father being something other than human — more so if the “gestation” involved a Face Full of Alien Wing-Wong and/or if the baby is a Fetus Terrible that follows a Chestburster-style of birth.
The dead mother may become The Lost Lenore for the father, the child her last gift to him. She may also be considered to be Too Good for This Sinful Earth or praised for strength and valor.
Can double as Death by Sex for a particularly Anvilicious Aesop. Often used in Fan Fiction for shows where Parental Abandonment is never explained. Very often a Truth in Television for at least 70% of the world's population (particularly those parts of the world where modern medicine is not readily accessible). According to the UNFPA in 2005, while the lifetime risk of maternal death for people in 'developed regions' is 1 in 7300, the average worldwide is 1 in 92, rising as high as 1 in 22 women for Sub-Saharan Africa (source). Note that the per pregnancy risk is lower since many of these cultures also have high birth rates since they also tend to have high infant mortality rates.
Incidentally, dying in childbirth is not pretty at all. Many such stories have a beautiful death that just results in the mother kissing her husband and baby goodbye. Writers often forget about the screaming, the bleeding, the fever, and the way that this agony could go on for days, and such writers either don't know this or just can't stomach it. It should be noted that some deaths in childbirth are pretty fast — a woman with uterine atony can hemorrhage to death in minutes without emergency medical intervention, but that's a lot of blood.
May be a set up for the Wicked Stepmother, Promotion to Parent or Missing Mom. If the baby dies in the womb, it's a Tragic Stillbirth. If someone other than the mother or baby dies, it's Birth/Death Juxtaposition.
This is far less common for stories set in modern times, as medical advancements make dying during childbirth extremely uncommon. However, this still may apply in stories with settings that lack such conveniences."
t05360,Deconstruction,"""Deconstruction"" literally means ""to take something apart"". When applied to tropes or other aspects of fiction, deconstruction means to take apart a trope so as to better understand its meaning and relevance to us in Real Life. This often means pursuing a trope's inherent contradictions and the difference between how the trope appears in this one work and how it compares to other relevant tropes or ideas both in fiction and Real Life. The simplest and most common method of applying Deconstruction to tropes in fiction among general audiences and fan bases, and the method most relevant to TV Tropes, takes the form of questioning ""How would this trope play out with Real Life consequences applied to it?"" or ""What would cause this trope to appear in Real Life?""
This doesn't mean magic and other fantastic or futuristic elements, or any other tropes must be removed or attacked for failing to match up with their own pretensions of self-consistent reality, of course. While sometimes perceived as an aggressive attack on the meaning or entertainment value of a work or text, deconstruction is not properly about passing judgment (and in fact, the term ""deconstruction"" was picked over the German term ""Dekonstruktion"" to suggest careful attention to the detail within a text over violently emptying the work of all meaning). It means that all existing elements of a work are played without the Rule of Cool, Rule of Drama, Rule of Funny, and so on, to see what hidden assumptions the work uses to make its point. Sometimes you will hear this referred to as ""played completely straight"", and it can be thought of as taking a work more seriously on its own terms than even the work itself does, for the purpose of laying bare hidden meanings in the text.
For example, in Dungeons  Dragons, when a cleric reaches fifth level, he gains the ability to cast create food and water. Normally, the impact this would have on a society (especially a medieval or pseudo-medieval one) is completely ignored. A Deconstruction would explore how a society would react to that ability.
Note that while deconstructions often end up darker, edgier, sadder and more cynical than the normal version, there is no reason they have to be. While the Deconstruction process can reveal things we weren't thinking about for a reason — a major contributing factor in why it tends to be depressing — Deconstructions are free to exist anywhere on the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism. Expanding on the Dungeons  Dragons example above, a cynical deconstruction would involve the food-creating clerics either being enslaved for their powers or becoming the ruling class in a Dystopia, while an idealistic deconstruction would involve the alleviation of scarcities and hardships based on class. Either one is perfectly valid.
And while it is true that dystopian settings and outcomes carry a far greater amount of conflict and thus make for far better story fodder than positive ones, giving a Deconstruction a cynical outlook just for the sake of there being a plot is not necessary; a story can be absolutely rife with conflict and still have an idealistic worldview overall.note For example, the post-scarcity DD society just described might not sound like an interesting place to set a story, but a writer could still prominently include it by having the story build up to that outcome, say, by showing the medieval society struggle with scarcity and/or following the cleric as he progressively learns the art of food creation magic over the majority of the plot, with the struggle over scarcity being purged from the setting at or near the story's climax as post-scarcity becomes a reality in-universe.
Sometimes the best fodder for deconstruction in a story or setting is not its major themes, but the aspects that are discussed the least, if at all. For instance, a work in which gender, sexuality, poverty, race, politics, etc. should have been important but were never dealt with adequately is ripe for a deconstruction.
Also note that Darker and Edgier, Rule of Drama and Cynicism Tropes do not by themselves turn works into Deconstructions, even if it means showing how dark and edgy something can be made. There are plenty of dark, edgy and dramatic tropes that are used without ever exploring the meaning behind them, or their realistic implications. While some of the most acclaimed works in their respective genres are deconstructions, and many deconstructions do utilize dark, cynical and dramatic tropes in the setting, it is the careful use and analysis of them that makes them acclaimed, not because they just have those tropes in them. See Not a Deconstruction.
Reconstruction is when the trope admits its flaws and then gets put back together, usually in a way that strengthens the trope. Think of Deconstruction as taking apart your broken car engine, and Reconstruction as putting it back together so it runs again. Deconstruction and reconstruction can become Cyclic Tropes. A set of conventions is established (the initial ""construction"" of the genre or ideas that are used in the story), this set of conventions is played straight until some author gets bored or frustrated with the implications the fantasy brings and decides to show us the unworkability of these conventions via a deconstruction of them. Atop the ruins, a more realistic narrative (i.e. one that accepts the criticisms of the earlier deconstruction) is then built via reconstruction, and in the future, this narrative gets deconstructed, etc. Cycles of deconstruction and reconstruction are a major element in how genres and tropes evolve. In philosophy, this evolution is also known as thesis-antithesis-synthesis.
Reminder: Before labeling something as a deconstruction, doublecheck that it's actually realistic.
See also Reality Ensues for when this happens temporarily, usually for humor rather than deconstruction, and Fridge Horror, which is what people often think of deconstruction: revealing how really terrifying and dark something is by thoroughly thinking about it."
t05412,DefiantCaptive,"A character who has been captured but certainly not cowed.
Let's say Alice has been captured, but instead of docilely doing what she's told, she resists attempts to control her. She may attempt to reason with her captor or play mindgames from her cell. If they explain The Plan behind her kidnapping, she'll point out everything wrong with it. At most passive, she'll engage in Passive-Aggressive Kombat or a hunger strike. At her most active, she'll try to escape. Whether or not she succeeds is irrelevant; the point is that she's doing all she can to make life difficult for her captor in spite of the situation.
The Badass in Distress will usually be defiant. This can overlap with Defiant to the End if not even the prospect of death can break her. If she is resilient to the point it causes more abuse for whoever tried to capture her, you may be inclined to Pity the Kidnapper. It has been said that the duty of any Prisoner of War is to force their captors to dedicate as many resources as possible to holding them rather than fighting their still free and fighting comrades.
Contrast Damsel in Distress, who generally is too frightened, inexperienced, or helpless to put up a fight; compare Damsel out of Distress, who rescues herself.
Despite the female pronouns used in the description, this is a gender neutral trope."
t05453,DeliberateValuesDissonance,"Sometimes, morals don't travel well. Often, what is appropriate to one culture at a given time can be repugnant to the same culture at another, or vice versa. Thus, when depicting other cultures, a creator has to choose whether to portray them accurately or not. Many just use their own contemporary culture for everyone in the story for narrative reasons or just to make writing it easier, resulting in an inaccurate and/or anachronistic story. Some, however, research the culture and make an effort to reproduce the attitudes of the time and place accurately, even when they are wildly different to what the author knows or might consider sensible. Thus one ends up with a case of Deliberate Values Dissonance.
In Historical Fiction and Historical Fantasy, this is an obvious necessity to avoid anachronisms; indeed readers may criticize works for failure to reflect the actual historically accurate views as an Anachronism Stew. This may result in an Author Tract, the story condemning or praising certain values or societal norms that are no longer relevant. Be wary, though, for sometimes Reality Is Unrealistic and the deliberately different values end up just as inaccurate, but in the opposite direction—a story could present some value as being a relic of the past even if it's still widespread at the time of its writing, or present a value as common in a specific place or time period even if it wasn't (in fact, the page quote is an example of this; murdering one's unfaithful wife with a fireplace poker was hardly universally accepted as appropriate behavior even in the Renaissance).
For Speculative Fiction this is also often a necessity, as it would make no sense for radically different societies—even if they are presented as a future version of the ""present"" society—to adopt exactly the same values. This can result in an Author Tract of a different kind, presenting values the author believes could or should arise in certain situations. Conversely, this could simply be a tool for World Building, especially in stories involving extraterrestrials or otherwise completely ""alien"" civilizations. When moral systems are so different from a reader's culture that they are almost incomprehensible, Blue and Orange Morality is the result.
Another way to sidestep this problem is to write a family-friendly story set in a small community with a near-homogeneous population, where controversial social or political issues never come up and in fact, can scarcely be imagined.
Often a meditation on or argument against Good Flaws, Bad Flaws. In its most exaggerated form you may get Bad is Good and Good is Bad.

t05481,DemonicPossession,"Why hello there! Shelvek the Seducer welcomes you to her den of decadence. What? Of course Shelvek the Seducer is a woman! Are these Femme Fatalons not proof enough? The male body I currently inhabit is but a meat-dress for my demonic essence.
You see, my dear, Shelvek the Seducer has taken possession of this fragile and handsome body from its rightful owner. How did I do this? Oh, there are so many delectable ways!
A Puppeteer Parasite can do this with science, but it lacks a certain je ne sais quoi. The Virus on the other hand simply cores out the host's mind like an apple, effectively ""killing"" the original personality and soul of the host immediately. And the Living Doll Collector uses People Puppets, how ingenious! What amazes Shelvek the Seducer is that you humans do it to each other, not that it isn't deliciously kinky. Also, though it shames Shelvek the Seducer to admit it, this trope is not solely restricted to demons. Angelic Possession works in precisely the same way, except that those feathery hypocrites don't know how to have fun with it.
You may notice that I tend to appear slightly obscured behind the possessed in artful depictions. This pleasantly subtle fact emphasizes that Shelvek the Seducer is ""in charge"". Sadly, mirrors will reveal Shelvek's true nature, making social outings... problematic.
Oh, don't worry. I assure you, Shelvek the Seducer is the only one here. If my ten brothers were with me, we would be Many Spirits Inside of One. But then it would be cramped in this body and I don't like lack of space. And don't think about trying to get chummy with me; some may like a Symbiotic Possession, where the host and the guest are on good terms with each other, but I'm not a very sociable person. That said, you can rest assured I take good care of my meat-dresses, no sense taking over a body only to burn it out like a lightbulb.
Hmm, you aren't bad looking yourself. Would you mind terribly if I ""change clothes""...? Don't worry, you won't remember a thing afterwards. More's the pity."
t05491,DemotedToExtra,"We have a member of the supporting cast. They're important to the plot. Sure, they fall Out of Focus at times, but they're still pretty relevant to the proceedings for the most part. But then comes the sequel, or an adaptation, or The Movie, and... hey, where'd they go? They weren't completely written out, but they just weren't good enough to keep what importance they had in the original. The character's fanbase will complain, while everyone else may just accept it as the new status quo.
Opposite of the Ascended Extra; instead of a background or one-off character becoming a key member of the supporting cast, a key member of the supporting cast becomes a background or one-off character. Also contrast Spotlight-Stealing Squad, which can also cause this to happen; that said, there may not be anyone in particular that takes these characters' screentime, and the presence of a Spotlight Stealing Squad doesn't mean no one else is plot-important anymore. In works where Anyone Can Die, supporting characters fated to die may end up demoted to extra before their deaths.
This trope is for characters who become unimportant to the story, but are still seen or mentioned occasionally; for characters who disappear completely from the story as if they had never existed, see Chuck Cunningham Syndrome for when they disappear from the original work and Adapted Out for when they never appear in the adaptation.
Compare Shoo Out the Clowns, Sir Not-Appearing-in-This-Trailer, Not as You Know Them, The Artifact, Out of Focus, What Happened to the Mouse?, Chuck Cunningham Syndrome, and Commuting on a Bus. Contrast Ascended Extra, Breakout Character, and Ensemble Dark Horse."
t05512,DepravedBisexual,"In most series, either Everyone Is Bi or there are No Bisexuals; there's usually not much room in between. However, there is one group of bisexuals who seem all too well represented in the mainstream: the cold-blooded murderous sociopaths.
This is a very different phenomenon from the Psycho Lesbian trope. Whereas the Psycho Lesbian is usually violent or deranged out of unrequited love and/or jealousy, the typical Depraved Bisexual is bi because, well, why not? Their willingness to sleep with everyone they can is just one facet of their Ax-Craziness — i.e. they don't consider certain relationships taboo, because they don't consider anything taboo. A slightly less pathological version of the trope depicts the Depraved Bisexual as ""simply"" supremely manipulative; recognizing the effectiveness of sex as a control mechanism, they resort to it at every opportunity — reasoning that successful seductions gain new thralls, while even unsuccessful ones tend to increase others' fear of you. Male instances are disproportionately likely to be Sissy Villains, but not as often as you might think.
Interestingly enough, though, many if not most Lesbian Vampires are in fact bisexual. Fanservice, you know.
More common in film than on TV, where LGBT+ folk of any sort, and especially bisexuals, were originally a rarity (this changed over time). Of the TV instances, several are Mirror Universe duplicates, to show just how evil and different they are from the originals. At one time this was practically the only way an explicitly bisexual character could appear in any film, anywhere; in his book Bisexual Characters in Film, Wayne Bryant is able to fill a whole chapter of examples of this, as well as another book about bisexual murder victims. In more pleasant examples, bisexual characters simply don't follow Cast Speciation as much as a solidly gay character does and are less likely to be used. An exception is in a mystery plot, where a potential ex-lover being a suspect suddenly becomes much harder to pin down.
Contrast Bi the Way, where the character just happens to be attracted to both men and women without being portrayed as depraved; and Anything That Moves, where the bisexual/pansexual character just happens to be also hypersexual, or Extreme Omnisexual, where the character is willing to bang anything. See also the older, far more discredited trope of the Depraved Homosexual, which this trope has largely replaced in modern works."
t05563,DespairEventHorizon,"The line that, once crossed, destroys any last remaining sense of hope. It could be for a cause, a person, a situation, or simple survival. A character has given up on it, and there is no going back. It can lead soldiers to despair — or even suicide, if they don't simply lose the will to live. It can turn an Ideal Hero into an Anti-Hero or an outright villain, or even, in some cases, vice versa. It is a vital element of Tragedy.
Coming near this line is quite common in fiction; frequently, at the end of the second act or the 45 minute mark of a drama or the first hour of a film, the protagonist comes dangerously close to the edge before a Rousing Speech or Deus ex Machina or the like comes along. It makes for a Downer Ending if the protagonist does fall over the edge. Frequently, this is when the What You Are in the Dark test hits him. Alternatively, many stories have a hero ""Fighting the Good Fight"" and meeting someone who'd been at it longer and lost all hope.
This is often a goal of some wars. Break the enemy's morale, and you can achieve victory even without military success.
Related to Heroic BSoD and Heroic Safe Mode, except the hero usually comes back from those. A Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds is often a character who crossed this line long ago. It can result in the character entering an Angst Coma, being Dumb Struck or suffering Death by Despair (and subsequently crossing the Moral Event Horizon or Jumping Off the Slippery Slope). Often a result of We Used to Be Friends or some variants of Personal Horror. This is often the final stage of the Break the Cutie process. In a video game, often happens during a Bleak Level, and it may be relevant if the game has a Morale Mechanic.
May be preceded with a Hope Spot, just to really twist the knife. And a Downer Ending might follow in really dark stories.
Often a factor in Pater Familicide. May be feigned by critics engaged in a Critic Breakdown.
Compare Safety in Indifference, Hope Is Scary (the reason nobody ever crosses the horizon back again), Hope Crusher (someone who delights seeing characters crossing this horizon, or even worse, pushing other people to cross the horizon).
Contrast Heroic Spirit.
IMPORTANT: This is about a character losing all hope, not merely getting depressed, upset, or bored."
t05598,Determinator,"A character — good or evil, male or female, young or old — who never gives up. Ever. No matter what.
There is no stopping the Determinator. They do not understand tact. They do not Know When to Fold 'Em, and it's a waste of time to tell them the odds. No one can reason with them. They'll do whatever they have to without question. No price is too great to pay for success, up to and including their own life. Do not expect them to realize they might be better off letting it go, even if they can barely stand. If you're ever kidnapped or lost with no hope of rescue, they'll be the one who will find you. Their adversaries will shout, in exasperated rage, ""Why Won't You Die?!"". For them, there is no line between ""perseverance"" and ""insanity.""
The nobility of their goal is not necessarily proportionate to their persistence. This is just as often an obsessive rival with a grudge as it is a hero on a chivalrous quest, and where their willpower ultimately leads them will depend both on their role and on where the work stands on the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism. Heroes — especially Badass Normals with a Screw Destiny attitude — will defeat villains by virtue of being too stubborn to stay down. Anti Heroes will Jump Off The Slippery Slope, forsake The Powers of Love and Friendship, become like that which they fight, and walk the thin line between victory and tragedy. Villains will refuse to admit defeat, resist seemingly fatal punishment, hunt their prey tirelessly and relentlessly, and let the heroes know that We Will Meet Again. And mailmen will always get your mail to you.
Shōnen anime and manga love this trope, such that it is quite rare to find a protagonist of these works who isn't a Determinator and is guaranteed where super-heated blood is involved.
Compare and contrast with Implacable Man (or woman)— while a Determinator pursues their goal through sheer willpower, the Implacable Man is driven by artificial, unnatural, or magical means, and often suffers no apparent damage at all.
Compare Suicidal Overconfidence, a common feature of many Video Game genres where enemies will always, blindly, and relentlessly be at your throat with no regard for how horribly you are massacring them (though this is more due to genre requirements than characterization). Compare Tragic Dream, where becoming a Determinator can only end in tears. Can be identified by their trademark Determined Expression.

t05612,DeusExMachina,"A Deus ex Machina (pron: /diːəs ɛks mækɪnə/ for Britons, /deɪuːs ɛks mɑːkɪnə/ for Americans; /deus eks maːkʰinaː/ in the orginal Latin) is when some new event, character, ability, or object solves a seemingly unsolvable problem in a sudden, unexpected way. It's often used as the solution to what is called ""writing yourself into a corner,"" where the problem is so extreme that nothing in the established setting suggests that there is a logical way for the characters to escape. If a bomb is about to go off, someone finds a convenient bomb-proof bunker in easy reach. If a protagonist falls off a cliff, a flying robot will suddenly appear to catch them. A Million-to-One Chance of something occurring is accomplished by a bystander who didn't know what they were doing.
The term is Latin for ""god out of the machine"" and originates in ancient Greek theater.note the original classical Greek ""theos ek mekhanikos"" became ""deus ex machina"" through Latin translations of Greek literary criticism in the Renaissance. It referred to scenes in which a crane (machine) was used to lower actors or statues playing a god or gods (deus) onto the stage to set things right, often near the end of the play. In its most literal interpretation, this is when a godlike figure or power, with all the convenient power that comes with that, arrives to solve the problem. A Divine Intervention need not always be a Deus ex Machina or the sole way this trope plays out however.
Note that there are a number of requirements for a sudden plot development to be a Deus ex Machina:
The concept eventually came back into vogue during the early years of the film industry thanks to The Hays Code. Villains, and anyone else who didn't toe the moral line, were absolutely not allowed to get away with their crimes. But, more often than not Evil Is Cool. The solution was to let the bad guy be awesome for the duration of the movie, then drop a bridge on them in the last five minutes.
Remember, even the notorious Deus ex Machina can be pulled off. Sudden resolutions are perfectly capable of leading to satisfying conclusions - see the entire ""Rule Of X"" series of tropes: Rule of Cool, Rule of Cute, Rule of Empathy, Rule of Fun, Rule of Funny, Rule of Romantic, Rule of Scary, Rule of Sexy (for those ever-so-fun Deus Sex Machinas), Rule of Symbolism, and especially Rule of Drama. Apparent Deus ex Machina also happen plenty in real life, given reality is far more complex and random than most fictionalized versions of it.
Compare to the Reset Button, Non-Protagonist Resolver, Diabolus ex Machina, Coincidental Broadcast, You Didn't Ask, Eureka Moment and Suspiciously Specific Sermon. Not to be confused with the tropes Deus Est Machina, Deus Exit Machina or Ave Machina. Nor the works Deus Ex, Deus Ex: Invisible War, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Deus ex Machina, Ex Machina or Ex Machina.
Please make sure an example meets the criteria before submitting. This is not a place to Complain About Plot Twists You Don't Like."
t05657,DidNotGetTheGirl,"This trope is when The Protagonist — who is clearly not celibate — doesn't end up with the Love Interest. Someone else wins her heart or she has no choice but to marry someone to save her family or something. For whatever reason the hero ends the story alone. It can be played either for comedy or tragedy. It isn't always a Downer Ending or a Bittersweet Ending, but it sure does tend to be that way.
Despite the name, this trope can just as easily apply to not getting the guy.
It is related to No Romantic Resolution (resolution here is: it didn't work out). Compare to Better as Friends and Romantic Runner-Up. Contrast Everything but the Girl, where the protagonist usually does get the girl eventually. Not to be confused with two leads not ending up together because one of them dies — that is a different trope, Death of the Hypotenuse when one of the leads is the hypotenuse of someone else, and Platonic Life-Partners where neither of them wanted each other in the first place. See also Dump Them All, where the protagonist rejects all of his Love Interests instead of them leaving him.
Spoileriffic, obviously."
t05730,DinosaursAreDragons,"What could be more dangerous (or more awesome) than a T. rex? A T. rex that flies and breathes fire.
This is a good example of a trope that appears to be changing from one thing to another. Basically, some people just can't get over how similar some dinosaurs are to dragons.
Both are big lizardy things, right? They're already so similar, why not have all dinosaurs be fearsome carnivores? Because hey — big lizard things just have to eat meat, just like dragons! And if they ever meet with humans, they must messily devour them all! Just like dragons!
And while we're at it, why not associate dinosaurs with lava-spewing volcanoes? Or even give them the ability to breathe fire? It'd be a shame not to, right?
This is especially prevalent in pulp adventure novels, B-movies, and video games set in prehistoric worlds where Everything's Trying To Kill You.
There is a bit more justification for this confusion in Eastern media; it's largely due to a long-standing translation mixup. When people discovered fossil bones in ancient China, they figured they were dragon bones (to be more precise, bones shed by dragons who have achieved their final, fully airborne forms). Many crushed dinosaur fossils were sold over the years as ""dragon bone powder."" No one knows how many important discoveries were lost due to the superstition. In any case, the words for ""dragon"" and ""prehistoric creature"" in most Asian languages are very similar, and sometimes it's simply used to refer to both dinosaurs and dragons. This goes a longnote ""Long"" is Mandarin for dragon, ""Kong Long"" for dinosaur way to explain why many Chinese dinosaurs have dragon-derived names. Not to mention why, especially in video games, dinosaur-like creatures have fire-breathing abilities and dragon-like creatures are identified as dinosaurs.
The Western origins of this trope are a bit more complicated. It may have something to do with the popular notion that associates ancient times with loads and loads of flame-spewing volcanoes. There was a lot of volcanic activity during the Cretaceous, but it certainly was nowhere near as violent as depicted in fiction, and it had more to do with poison gas than rivers of lava and hellfire raining down everywhere. But take a look at early paleo-art and you'll not only see tons of lava, but also many dinosaurs who look suspiciously like dragons wandering in this hellish, primeval, pre-human landscape. Some art critics, like W. J. T. Mitchell, have wondered if the older ""tripod stance"" seen in early depictions of bipedal dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex is meant to at least subconsciously bring to mind images of the Biblical ""upright serpent"". Speaking of, this trope probably has some relationship with the belief, held by both certain creationists and some cryptozoologists, that some dinosaurs survived the mass extinction and inspired the stories of dragons. One Kent Hovind goes so far as to say that some species ""must"" have breathed fire (because The Bible — or at least the King James Version, which was made and named for a man who literally wrote a book on witch hunting — mentions dragons) and may still exist in some Lost World in The Amazon or somewhere. Other creationists even think literal dragons and other mythical creatures actually existed and met humans (along with dinosaurs).
The older version of the trope is gradually becoming more and more discredited as it filters into the pop-culture consciousness that dinosaurs, really, were just another kind of animal. The newer version comes at the issue from a different angle: now it's more like Dragons Are Dinosaurs. Quite a few anthropologists are now suggesting that many of the legends of fantastic beasts were based upon misinterpreted fossils. This may also tie into recent depictions of Feathered Dragons — as it's a well-established fact by now that most carnivorous dinosaurs were birdlike, feathered animals, dragons associated with them may be given feathers of their own as a result.
In any case, look for fantasy worlds where wizards are finding dragon fossils and local legendary dragons who turn out to be surviving dinosaurs.
Dinosaurs are Dragons may be considered a subtrope of Prehistoric Monster, which talks about the pop-portraits of general prehistoric life. See also Our Dragons Are Different, Fiery Salamander, Here There Were Dragons, Giant Flyer, Reptiles Are Abhorrent, Ptero Soarer, and (naturally) Artistic License – Paleontology.
Note that this is not limited to dinosaurs, and can apply to other prehistoric reptiles like pterosaurs, too."
t05738,DirectLineToTheAuthor,"Sometimes, ""this is a true story"" is part of the fiction.
Once in a while a really well written story can feel so real that you begin to wonder if it might not be based on a true story. Occasionally this is actually the case, or supposedly so, but there are times when an author (etc) will go right out of their way to create greater immersion in their work by claiming that their very obviously fictional and fantastic world is in some way real. Usually they claim that they didn't come up with the story, rather it was recounted to them by the actual main characters (or some other witness), often physically, but sometimes by phone or magic. Other times they will claim that they found the account in the form of a diary and novelised it, or, if it is a film, that it comprises found footage or a mixture of found footage and Dramatisation.
Another common method is to claim that the book was written as a testimony (or confession) to actual events - possibly the most notable example of this is The Guild of Specialists trilogy, which takes the love that boys' annuals have for intricate diagrams and maps to its absolute extreme and fabricates not only a plethora of large diagrams, maps, and sketches, but photos and objects. In this version the author pretends they are simply publishing something that someone else has written - this often takes the form of a novelization of a diary or a set of notebooks. Other methods include accounts by secondary characters and so on. This trope, a staple of children's books and fantastic tales, often features an Author Avatar or even instances of From Beyond the Fourth Wall or other strangeness and may be said to be translated from accounts of what happened or books written by the characters and never actually communicated in person.
In all these cases, however, it is considered canon that the author is repeating a story that is in fact true, if only to a certain degree. One of the people the story is about may even be the author themselves.
Compare ...And That Little Girl Was Me, and Based on a Great Big Lie.
Absolutely not to be confused with Literary Agent Hypothesis, when fans think that maybe the story is actually real, or like to think it is, but don't have any support from canon or Word of God. Also not to be confused with A True Story in My Universe, for In-Universe examples. Often ties in with Author Avatar and may involve an admitted Unreliable Narrator.
Note: This trope only applies to canon and Word of God examples in fictional works. In-Universe examples go in A True Story in My Universe. Pure Fanon examples go in Literary Agent Hypothesis."
t05745,DirtyCoward,"The Dirty Coward is the slime of the earth, working exclusively for themselves and shamelessly retreating from harm's way even if that harm is about to hit the All-Loving Hero that just saved his or her life two seconds ago. They'll take every advantage and are not above using dishonorable tactics and dirty tricks, but they'll cry and moan every time the tables are turned and someone uses the same tactics against them, asks for a volunteer, or reminds them of that promise they made. Often full of vicious plans for anyone they dislike, as long as they aren't in need of that person's skills at the moment.
Though the Dirty Coward may be a sociopath (or a Social Darwinist), they're certainly not heroic or comedic. And if they're a bastard, they're certainly not meant to be magnificent. They're usually only marginally competent to start with, and even the cleverest of them tends to be short-sighted. Even when they know that breaking ranks will leave a hole in the defenses that will let the enemy in, leading to far more danger for them in the long term, they will generally run for it anyway (and get shot In the Back). Their allegiance almost always lies with whoever can cause them the most immediate harm, even if that threat isn't likely to last. They'll be happy to badmouth people to their faces when they can not immediately hurt them, only to attempt to curry favor when the roles reverse. Dirty Cowards are especially prone to suffering a Karmic Death, usually at the hands of whatever they were trying to run from, and are similarly likely to suffer a Villainous Breakdown.
Usually a villain unless used comically, although they may sometimes be a certain type of civilian that gets in the way. When used as a villain, this is a cheap way to make the heroes look good in comparison, even if they're not everything they should be. Villainous Dirty Cowards tend to fall squarely into Neutral Evil, since they are first and foremost out for their own hides at the expense of others. One of the best ways to demean the Big Bad is by making them out to be a coward. It's doubly ironic if the one who brings fear into the hearts of others turns out to be a pathetic scaramouch who hypocritically makes others feel weak because they are really the weak one and try to hide it. After all, only The Bully can bring the ""dirty"" into the Dirty Coward trope.
It's tough to make a main character into one of these without them coming off as more slimy and irritating than funny. Unlike most villains, the dirty coward doesn't even have finesse, which can make them extremely annoying. The dirty coward may or may not have a horrific past to explain their actions, but it doesn't usually redeem them, at least not in the minds of the audience. When their backstory doesn't seem all that convincing, but convinces The Hero, it can be seen as a major cop-out.
The best way to make this character tolerable is to make them at least somewhat clever. Some enlightened self-interest can occasionally be mixed in, although too much of any trait other than cravenness tends to change the character into something else.
May Level Grind in courage if they realize ""My God, What Have I Done?"".
The Dirty Coward is pretty much almost Always Male, for the dubious reason that women aren't expected to be brave in the first place, and are allowed to sacrifice others to save themselves. Fridge Logic may lead to the Neutral Female coming off as a Distaff Counterpart to the Dirty Coward.
May be the Miles Gloriosus, and even believe his own brags when out of danger. The Fearless Fool may invoke this to persuade his companions to act like idiots. The Bully is often a Dirty Coward, brave enough when tormenting those weaker than they are, but showing their true colors in the face of those equal to or stronger than they are. Also similar is the Original Position Fallacy, in which one holds a moral position on the assumption they will receive the benefits, without considering that they may be among the ones to suffer from said beliefs. Not to be confused with the Combat Pragmatist, who may employ tactics that can be considered dirty and cowardly but does so out of cold calculation rather than fear. Contrast the Lovable Coward, who numbers among the good guys and has foibles portrayed far more sympathetically, generally due to their not trying to pose as anything but a coward, and even then will often face their fears and ultimately still risk their lives if the chips are really down. The So-Called Coward is by definition mistaken for one of these; if they don't want to be, they'll say ""Nobody Calls Me ""Chicken""!."" Also see Sore Loser, for when someone isn't afraid of death so much as they are of losing, though many Dirty Cowards are also Sore Losers. See also Opportunistic Bastard.
This Trope might apply to a Cowardly Boss, but it more often applies to a ""Get Back Here!"" Boss. Compare Villains Want Mercy."
t05765,DisappearedDad,"A subtrope of Parental Abandonment: The father of a character or characters is missing or absent.
Perhaps he's dead, or maybe he was murdered. Perhaps he's left and there's bitterness involved. Perhaps he's off fighting evil. Or maybe it's psychological absence — he's physically there, but is completely negligent in his fatherly duties. Regardless of what happened — and regardless of whether or not the viewers find out what happened — Mom seems to have raised her children on her own, or with the help of a father substitute.
There's a bit of a Double Standard in fiction regarding single parents. A Disappeared Dad is far less likely to have his absence explained than a Missing Mom. When he's not in the picture, it's often taken for granted that he's either dead or a deadbeat and the story just keeps moving along with no thought to his whereabouts. But if he is alive, he is more likely to return and reconcile, or be a non-entity who sporadically appears just to remind the hero that Daddy doesn't care about them. note The flipside is that if both parents are absent, the character is far more likely to be obsessed with his or her lost father. Characters who have lost both parents often do not mention the lost mother at all, or she doesn't play nearly as large a role in the backstory. It is also possible for the Disappeared Dad to not know he's a dad at all. Unlike the Missing Mom, he doesn't actually have to be present during childbirth. The mother could very well be justified in keeping the father out of the loop. When this type of Disappeared Dad is actually an established character, you get Luke, You Are My Father.
Compare and contrast this with Missing Mom. Combine the two, and you get Parental Abandonment. Sometimes, though, Daddy Had a Good Reason for Abandoning You. If Dad is dead, we may see a Happier Home Movie. If he is simply too busy to be with his child, it's When You Coming Home, Dad?. If he doesn't have a lot of time but is willing to spend money on gifts and trips for the kids, it's Disneyland Dad. If he's wanted by the authorities, then he's a Notorious Parent. See also Tell Me About My Father, So Proud of You, Turn Out Like His Father, Glorified Sperm Donor, and Ambiguously Absent Parent. Contrast ""Well Done, Son!"" Guy."
t05847,DisproportionateRetribution,"In some situations, it makes sense to let the opponent know that if they so much as sneeze on someone you protect, it will cost them a limb. If you have tried an eye for an eye and it really didn't do anything except help sell eyepatches, the only way to stay alive is to be drastic. Pay back any offense tenfold, or even a hundredfold if necessary, until the survivors learn to stay away. It's a common tactic of militaries the world over, with some regimes (such as Nazi Germany) being infamous for it.
That said, the ""Justice"" these rivals have in mind is more akin to a brutal beatdown... well, most of the time it is an actual brutal No-Holds-Barred Beatdown, supposed to culminate in the receiver's humiliation or death. Any attempt to get them to see the (all too obvious) truth, show mercy, or realize they're a step away from utterly ruining the receiver's life/committing murder will never succeed. It invariably takes the hero beating the rival, be it in a Cooking Duel or Good Old Fisticuffs, and proving Right Makes Might for the poor deluded soul to realize they were wrong all along, sometimes even coming around and realizing that Defeat Means Friendship.
Villains who claim that their bad past/circumstances led them to do this will likely make you realize that Freudian Excuse Is No Excuse.
All too often, these guys refuse to see reason. They promise that they'll come back to kill the hero, and shove his ""mercy"" and offer of friendship down his wind pipe. It might take the arrival of a plot significant character to clear things up and hand out some Epiphany Therapy to all involved.
This is not limited to the antagonist's side. God help you if that hero you've harmed has a Poisonous Friend. And all parties to a masquerade, good or bad, are often required to kill any poor schmuck who accidentally sees something he's not supposed to.
This could be what stops something from being an ""act of justice"" instead of an ""act of vengeance "". May be used as part of Cruel Mercy. A common habit for Lawful Stupid characters.
Intriguingly, while disproportionate can possibly mean underdoing it, you'll almost never see that happen.
A Sister Trope to
Compare:
If the retribution is played for laughs, compare Comedic Sociopathy.
Contrast with Unishment (a punishment that isn't a punishment at all) and Restrained Revenge (paying back a slight with retribution that is less severe than what was intended before rather than forgive the person in question). Expect the character dishing this out to justify this no matter what anyone speaks against it. Expect someone (doesn't needs be the Only Sane Man) to be Disappointed by the Motive if the retribution is just that absurdly disproportional to the reason.
See also Pay Evil unto Evil, which is what this trope can result from when done wrong, and for more proportionate responses, Laser-Guided Karma.
Any real life examples, and we put your fingers through a meat grinder."
t05943,DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything,"Any situation which is made, sometimes for comic effect, sometimes for dramatic effect, to look like another situation — not in the sense that it is mistaken for that other situation by any of the characters, just in the sense that we the audience see the resemblance. The characters do not. Alternatively it can refer to an ersatz of something more familiar that the audience would immediately recognize in subtext, in order to make it look less Anvilicious, but it doesn't always succeed in fulfilling the latter. The situation doesn't always have to mean anything sexual, however it is the most common use of the trope.
This sort of situation can lead to a Mistaken for Index plot if some other character hears it out of context. If unintentionally done, this is Looks Like She Is Enjoying It. May result in Getting Crap Past the Radar if it alludes to something that would normally get censored. Similar to Innocent Innuendo/Visual Innuendo in that each of these tropes attempts to draw suggestive ideas from the audience; however Innocent Innuendo/Visual Innuendo attempt to trick the audience into thinking the situation is different from what it really is, whereas this trope is upfront about the situation and merely draws parallels to those suggestive ideas. Not to be confused with Ironic Echo, which can easily use this trope's title as a Lampshade Hanging.
Sub Tropes include:
See also Freud Was Right, which posits that characters can apply this to everything thanks to psychological subtext, and Freudian Slip, when the symbolism reveals what the character is really thinking."
t05968,DomesticAbuse,"Domestic abuse, defined as physical or emotional abuse between members of a romantic or familial relationship, was once a recurring comedy trope throughout history. After all, physical and verbal abuse between characters is often considered funny, and romantic relationships were no exceptions. Lately, however, the Unfortunate Implications of Domestic Abuse have gotten more attention, at least for one side of the equation: male-on-female Domestic Abuse.
In modern times this type of domestic abuse is most often used as the impetus for more dramatic plot developments, such as a wife having to face the fear of domestic violence and gain the courage to leave her marriage. In these cases a Dude, Not Funny! may be uttered if someone tries to make light of the situation. Still, female-on-male domestic abuse is still almost always played for laughs.
May also be an element of a Destructive Romance or a Big, Screwed-Up Family, making it an extreme case of Love Hurts. On another hand, Romanticized Abuse occurs when mistreatment is presented as a form of Fanservice. Sometimes, another man will take exception to this behavior. Expect stories revolving around this to involve a lot of Victim Blaming.
Compare Abusive Parents. Also see The Bluebeard and Black Widow.
See also Values Dissonance and Double Standard: Abuse, Female on Male."
t06016,DonutMessWithACop,"In fiction, it's much more probable that you'll see a cop eating a donut than anyone else, except for Homer Simpson. The cop guarding your jail cell is often seen dunking their donut with pink frosting or similar in their cup of coffee. The cop in the stakeout may have a half-empty box of donuts in their car. When taking a break from driving, they commonly hang out at the donut shop.
In more humorous displays, the cop might react to a donut as Scooby-Doo would to a scooby snack. Donuts may be the defining motivation for them to have joined the force. In fact, ""Officer Donut"" is a casual insult for a cop. A police character might be so obsessed that they could be bribed to do anything for donuts.
In actuality, the association between police officers and donuts is less insulting and more practical. Cops will usually consume lots of coffee, because it's necessary for them to stay awake during the night, and the donut pairs well as a sweet to dunk in coffee or to remove its bitter aftertaste — all of which Makes Sense In Context. Donuts are also ready-made, boxed for easy storage, and do not melt or get inedible when old (depending on the recipe, some may only be edible for a few hours). They also tend to be both filling and cheap, and as donut shops tend to open early, for a while they were among the few places open for someone working the graveyard shift. Donut shops also tend to give out free donuts to law enforcement, partly as a public service and partly to encourage cops to hang around (and robbers to stay away).note This is illegal in some jurisdictions, as it is considered a form of bribery.
As donuts are fattening sweets, the cop munching them is commonly portrayed as a fat, lazy, moustached Obstructive Bureaucrat. Strangely, they never get glaze or frosting in their mustache.
As for corrupt cops, just remember that Evil Tastes Good - as do donuts. But if this trope brought into positive portrayals, especially as cowboy cops, the cops who munch donuts or other deserts frequently can be sometimes portrayed as smart guys.
While this might be Truth in Television, it could probably be seen today as an Evolving Trope. If anything, a cop might be hesitant in buying donuts because of the inevitable stigma associated with them. On the other hand, The Red Stapler effect comes into play. On their first round, a rookie might buy some donuts for the station, believing that all cops love them. But then, everyone does, so it's fair.
It should be noted that this is primarily an American/Canadian based trope, as donuts are nowhere near as popular with the police in many other countries. British Coppers, for example, tend to go for chips - which is to say in American, french fries - instead, and Filipino cops have a thing for pancit, the name given to several, Chinese-inspired, but locally-cooked, noodle dishes."
t06050,Doorstopper,"A common literary term that refers to a book being so thick and heavy that it can be used as a doorstopper. Or a literary weapon. Or a substitute for barbells. Or a method with which to give an orthopedist a job. While it is likely to be used in a spirit of derision, as it evokes the idea of Padding in spades, there are also many fine books that could technically stop a door or kill a man in a pinch.
Proper Doorstoppers (also known as Tree Killers) should be over 500 pages. If one book is over 1,000 pages, it is probably a Doorstopper. This goes double if the typeface is smaller than 10 point.
When talking about a ""doorstopper series"", the series in question is likely to involve great battles between good and evil, a Chosen One and mysterious jewelry. It is a doorstopper series if, and only if, every actual book in the series is a Doorstopper.
Oftentimes, publishers will turn an ordinary trilogy, tetralogy, or series into one huge book. The result is not always a Doorstopper but it is an ""Omnibus"", and the biggest ones can still be used to stop doors, press flowers, act as fake gold in a bank robbery, or crush small children. These are sometimes for the convenience of fans of the series. Other times, with very long series or ones where the order almost doesn't matter, it's to sell volumes that don't sell anywhere near as well as the most popular books in the series. Conversely, a publisher might avoid releasing an intimidating doorstopper by having the book Divided for Publication.
If there's any chance that a doorstopper can be adapted into film, they could either be condensed or split if the content could not be fitted into two or three hours.
Can and will cause massive muscle fatigue when reading while holding the book in your hands. Can also cause the written text to disappear into the centerfold — or the book itself to rip apart halfway through reading!
Technology Marches On, and these days, a doorstopper can still be really, really long, but all fits neatly on your comparatively light and small smartphone or favorite e-reader. Keep in mind how lucky we are today compared to the 20th century and before, when bookworms had to decide if they really wanted to lug the doorstopper of a book they were really enjoying with them on the bus to work.
The Visual Novel genre of Video Games and any video games that use this trope has taken this to an art form. These games can have upwards of 70+ straight hours of reading (around double the length of an average game, which is 25–40 hours) being unusually common for the high-profile games.
When a character takes this trope a little too literally, see Useful Book. Extremely useful if one wishes to Throw the Book at Them.
And what's a doorstopper without Loads and Loads of Characters? Of both types.
A doorstopper can incite a case of Archive Panic with one single volume."
t06175,DramaticIrony,"Some tropes, such as the Unreliable Narrator, ensure that the audience is never quite as well informed of the truth as the characters are (or, at least, one particular character). Dramatic Irony, or Suspense as it is also known, turns that on its head, letting the audience see the whole picture when The Protagonist, or even the entire cast, is kept largely in the dark. You, the viewer, are actually ahead of the characters.
Fat lot of good it does us though. When dramatic irony crops up, it's usually not to let us feel smugly superior; instead it's to toy with our fragile little emotions. If we're lucky, the emotion being manipulated will be amusement. In serious situations, dramatic irony will be present to make us squirm and bite our fingernails in anxiety, since we can see the danger coming but cannot communicate this knowledge to the characters in order to save them.
To really fit the definition though, one of the characters must make a statement, or perform an action, to fully illustrate that they are unaware of the situation. To the character, what they're saying or doing is perfectly sensible based on the knowledge they have. To the audience though, the statement or action is ludicrous or dangerously uninformed.
There are three main uses of Dramatic Irony (quite apart from the unintentional result of making things more spoilerproof):
This trope is a staple of theatre, thanks largely in part to the mechanics of that particular medium. Characters move on and off stage, but the audience stays in place. They're the only ones who stick around long enough to hear the ""whole story."" In the theatre, however, there's usually one other party who knows what's going on, especially if it's a Tragedy — and that is the villain.
Classic theatre usually favours tense or comedic use of dramatic irony. Modern media is more likely to employ the ""cringe factor"" variation, which walks the line between tragedy and comedy.
A character's Hidden Depths are often a source of Dramatic Irony. A favorite trick of time-travel or historical works; see It Will Never Catch On. Foregone Conclusion or Doomed by Canon may crank it Up to Eleven. May end with an Internal Reveal. The opposite is Tomato Surprise, when the characters know something that the audience doesn't know.
A type of Irony.
Compare Dramatically Missing the Point. Contrast ""Could Have Avoided This!"" Plot, where the drama come from them catching on to the Dramatic Irony too late. This trope is not ""general irony, Played for Drama""."
t06208,DreamingOfThingsToCome,"Dreams get omitted from fiction unless they are significant. When they are not Bad Dreams about the past, the dreamer will often be Dreaming of Things to Come.
These dreams can be symbolic, and are often obscure. They are always, of course, true, but nevertheless can blindside the character with their significance. Symbolic dreams, or ones that merely show elements of the future, may even be taken for dreams of the past. The Hero dreams of the villain and does not realize that this is a warning that he will pop up again soon; he thinks it is just Bad Dreams of the past villainy.
This can also be mistaken for Anxiety Dreams of something the character dreads in the future.
Dreams of Things to Come can be sent — by a god, by an oracle, by someone with magical or psychic ability other than the dreamer. This may shade into Talking in Your Dreams.
Often a way of Foreshadowing. Can be a Portent of Doom.
If the character merely pieces together everything he knows but had not connected, he is Dreaming the Truth; Dreaming of Things to Come requires that he gain new knowledge that he could not acquire outside the dream.
If the events are at the same time (approximately) as the dream, see Dream Spying; if before, see Dreaming of Times Gone By.
Psychic Dreams for Everyone are a subtrope where anyone can have them, and they are literal.
Not to be confused with dreams about other things that come."
t06260,DrivenToSuicide,"Whatever the reason, (a guilty conscience, the world is simply too much to bear, self-hatred, whether reasonable or unreasonable, or simply having seen some really weird shit,) a character may be driven to commit suicide. This may be as little as pondering their existence or as much as holding a gun to one's head. Most times, the character will have second thoughts, or will be talked down by a friend, but in shows where Anyone Can Die, the character may go through with it. In any case, this is a powerful way to underscore the desperation of the character. In a backstory, being Driven To Suicide can illuminate the character's Dark and Troubled Past. On desperate occasions, this can be a happy ending, but only if a majority of the viewers agree, and this is very rare.
In some cases, the reason for suicide may not be depression, but honor, as with ritual suicide. This is obviously more common in Japanese works (as in Japanese culture, traditionally suicide can be done to cleanse one's honor) than in Western ones (as in most Christian sects, suicide traditionally is a shameful act — but classical settings allow it to be presented as honourable, e.g. in Shakespeare). It was also accepted by various ancient Greek philosophies, particularly that of the Stoics, as well as the ancient Romans and Egyptians, both of whom lauded it as a dignified and timely alternative to illness, dementia, or disgrace. Some Proud Warrior Races, such as the nomadic Scythians, preferred suicide as an alternative to dying in bed, thus making this trope Older Than Feudalism. By contrast, Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, et al.) abhor suicide, believing that only God is permitted to say when a life may be ended — however, there is considerable debate over issues like euthanasia, capital punishment, and killing in war.
Sometimes this is done to deliver An Aesop about teen suicide by having Long-Lost Uncle Aesop show up in a Very Special Episode.
At the other extreme, victims of The Corruption, Compelling Voice, or other forms of compulsion may resort to this to prevent the monster they are about to become from being unleashed on the world. This may allow Dying as Yourself.
This is regularly played for laughs, despite the risk of falling into ""Dude, Not Funny!"" territory. Also incidentally, deliberately pushing someone into suicide is treated the same as premeditated first-degree murder in many countries. Unfortunately, minors can be total monsters to each other, and grave bullying at school or elsewhere often can have very sad consequences (the bully more often than not also gets off with a simple slap on the wrist, too).
Subtrope of Murder by Suicide. Super-Trope of Leave Behind a Pistol. Sister Trope to Psychic-Assisted Suicide, Ordered to Die, Tricked to Death, and Suicidal Sadistic Choice.
See also: I Cannot Self-Terminate, Suicide by Cop, Suicide by Sea, Ate His Gun, Bath Suicide, Better to Die than Be Killed, Goodbye, Cruel World!, Gayngst-Induced Suicide, Suicide by Sunlight and Murder-Suicide.
Contrast Face Death with Dignity, where one chooses to face the music (and the bullets); Bungled Suicide and Interrupted Suicide, where the character's attempt fails or is stopped by somebody else; Happily Failed Suicide, where the character is grateful to be alive after all, Mistaken for Suicidal, where a character is mistakingly thought to be suicidal when they're not, and Suicide Is Painless, where the character has no reason to commit suicide, but does so anyway. Also contrast Seppuku, a form of suicide usually associated with Samurai, which is done to retain honor if all other choices mean violating it.
Tragically, this is an all too common occurrence in Real Life, but due to the extremely sensitive and personal nature of this trope, please do not add real life examples.
This is a Death Trope, so expect spoilers, marked and unmarked."
t06293,DrowningMySorrows,"When characters get frustrated, they need a freaking drink. But when they are depressed, they get drunk.
A well-known Truth in Television. It is often played for sympathetic laughs, but it can also be dramatic, embarrassing or angsty, especially if it goes with Off the Wagon or in Real Life cases of alcoholism. A character who is usually very stoic or tough but turns into a pathetic drunk can be very pitiable, showing just how much they miss somebody, but be careful not to keep it going for too long or they may lose characterisation as a tough guy.
Characters who do this may also suffer from Bad Dreams and are prone to not eating enough, and it might lead to spending the night with somebody as the next step in ""healing"".
Men who undergo this for a period often grow a Beard of Sorrow during the time. Their residences often show the Mess of Woe. If he never recovers, then he's definitely hopeless.
If a friend shows up, the Power of Friendship can convert this to To Absent Friends. If the depressed character recovers, it will probably lead to a He’s Back moment. Sometimes. If not? Time to throw him into a solitary confinement chamber.
The Alcoholic is an extreme consequence of this trope played straight for long periods of time. The Hard-Drinking Party Girl does this from time to time. Characters in a Sugar Bowl replicate this in a family-friendly way by getting Drunk on Milk And Ice Cream. See Drunken Montage, an older trope that pictures the character stumbling through the big city night. A nicotine addict reaches for the Cigarette of Anxiety.
For characters who can't do this, see Never Gets Drunk."
t06358,DuelToTheDeath,"An affront has been committed!
The hero has been affronted. Or the villain has. Or someone has dragged the Damsel in Distress into some dangerous situation against her will. Or someone in the cast hasn't realized that they're in Cloudcuckooland and that it's a serious crime to offer Cheesy Poofs to the daughter of the mayor. Or it's a rival situation and ""this town ain't big enough for the both of us.""
Whatever the situation, sitting down rationally and talking out the differences is just not going to settle things. No, the only way the offended party feels they can have satisfaction is with a Duel to the Death — nothing else will do! So, after striking the offending person upside the head with a glove [horseshoe, brick, or rock optional] to announce your intent, possibly doing so in public, it's time to choose your weapons!
Weapon types can include:
...and it usually is considered bad form to use your superpowers if either or both parties has them. Villains, of course, will try to do so anyway. If one character lacks a weapon, Give Me a Sword may ensue — and other characters may use this to try to stop the duel. Generally, it is the right of the challenged to choose the manner of combat, and it is considered highly improper for the challenger to object to the choice.
Sometimes it's a formal ""pistols at dawn"" duel. Sometimes it's something dictated by The Government of the city, town, planet or dimension in which the scene takes place. Sometimes it's just a fight where there's an unspoken certainty that the loser will not be getting up again. Sometimes the location and circumstances of the duel are quite outrageous.
When the hero wins, he will almost always show mercy to his opponent, much to the opponent's humiliation (unless he's an Anti-Hero out for revenge, in which case all bets are off). In such cases, the villain may taunt the hero for cowardice or weakness; or he may try to take his own death blow after the duel has officially ended and the hero is walking away, in which case, fifty-fifty, the result will often be the villain getting killed in self defense (a form of Karmic Death) or the hero or one of his friends stopping the villain Just in Time.
When the villain wins, you can count on the villain to strike mercilessly. The other party will die or may have to be rushed to whatever works for first aid/resurrection in this instance. On the other hand, this may be the point of which you learn the other character is not a villain (Get It Over With is common).
And several duels in media end with the loser having to get out of town.
Honor may (theoretically) be satisfied with first blood, or first serious injury. However, because it will be fought with real weapons, any duel can end in death.
Commonplace in westerns, naturally, with the Quick Draw shoot out Showdown at High Noon as the duel type. Jidai Geki or chanbara movies also tend to end this way, with two samurai engaging in a Single-Stroke Battle over a matter of honor, and the outcome of this is usually the death of one or both of the samurai involved.
May overlap with Fight Clubbing, where the duel is, arguably, for fun. At least the spectator's fun. Compare Ten Paces and Turn. Often enforced in Gladiator Games and a Deadly Game. A situation where the combatants don't have a choice in the matter is an Involuntary Battle to the Death.
There are lesser variations, and greater ones beyond simply ""to the death.""
A lot of Card Game Anime actually end up with duels for The Fate Of The World rather than just the lives of the two involved. Serious Business, you know.
See Wizard Duel for the magical equivalent. Compare Combat by Champion, and Trial by Combat. Sniper duels are a subtrope, though they usually just occur in the normal course of warfare rather than being explicitly agreed upon beforehand.
The video game version of this, of course, is the Duel Boss.
Since this trope frequently involves death, fair warning: Spoilers beyond this point."
t06361,DueToTheDead,"One mark that distinguishes humans from nonhumans is that humans have funeral rites; they regard something as due to the dead and have for a long time. Indeed, since burials leave archeological evidence, we know that they occurred as long as 300,000 years ago, as a practice among the Neanderthals.
Unsurprisingly, this has been incorporated in art as a trope, as a mark of character, and is Older Than Dirt, with funeral rites in art from ancient civilizations. Evil characters will violate proper treatment of a corpse by mutilating, reanimating, or even eating the dead, though Due To The Dead is one of the most common standards villains maintain. Good characters will (rarely!) do the same to a dead Complete Monster or the like, but usually are marked by their proper respect for the dead, down to even letting Revenge end when the villain is dead; if they have to destroy bodies to contain a plague, or display it to prove that he is really dead, they will often find it Dirty Business.
Even when you put The ""Fun"" in ""Funeral"", and Hilarity Ensues, the humor tends to be dark and the characters nasty.
A wide variety of practices are possible, as in Real Life. Cremation and burial are the most common, but such practices as exposing to the dead to vultures and other unusual methods can be done in fiction as in life. Even slicing up the body — usually regarded as mutilation and proof of evil — has been done in Real Life as a means to free the soul from the body and has featured so in fiction. Preserving parts (usually bones) of the dead can be the mark of a Necromancer or of respect, depending on how used; see the Sub-Trope of Dead Guy on Display.
One funeral practice, however, will put the characters on the evil side, no matter how respectfully they carry it out: Human Sacrifice.
Note that some dead are due more than others. The Heroic Sacrifice calls for a well-attended funeral, making The Hero Famed In-Story, and perhaps even a monument. Sometimes to mitigate the effect of Dying Alone; What You Are in the Dark may threaten that the hero will die unmourned. Conversely, some are due less than most; the Complete Monster, the Dirty Coward, etc. may be dumped in an unmarked grave with minimal ceremony.
On the other hand, some of the living owe the dead more than others. Family and friends have a duty to carry this out, often through a Shrine to the Fallen. Strangers who perform such things for the dead are acting out of generosity; a Good Shepherd may perform such rites. Indeed, some ghosts manifest in order to properly reward a total stranger who arranged for the burial.
Other ways in which this trope might present itself: closing the eyes of someone who Dies Wide Open; sorting through the deceased's belongings (may result in Personal Effects Reveal); responding with Manly Tears or Tender Tears; a Meaningful Funeral, when most characters show due respect; a Lonely Funeral, when few; Libation for the Dead; Hats Off to the Dead; Dead Guy Junior; a Morality Chain continuing to bind postmortem; a determination to carry on the deceased character's work; people wearing The Poppy; and Never Speak Ill of the Dead.
However, no matter how beloved the dead, Excessive Mourning may be decried. Ghosts may complain that it is keeping them from peace, or characters may be criticized for neglecting their duties to the living.
Observing this may be necessary to prevent the deceased from being Barred from the Afterlife and coming back as a ghost or other form of The Undead — which may take the form of an Indian Burial Ground.
To discuss actual funeral practices, see Funerals. See also In Memoriam.
Of course, this being a Death Trope, expect massive SPOILERS."
t06452,EarlyInstallmentWeirdness,"Long running series often have to experiment a little before they find their niche: sometimes there are concepts abandoned early on that were fascinating, either because they were potentially good ideas back then, or they just clash so much with the later tone of the series. In short, the first installment is a ""prototype"", like a pilot of a first episode.
This is particularly common in television, where the pilot episode is usually filmed long in advance of a show's actual debut. This gives the studio and creative team a chance to evaluate what worked and what didn't and make significant changes, including replacing cast members. In particularly dramatic cases, a series can undergo something of a Retool between its pilot and its second episode.
If the series improves after abandoning these elements, it often leads to a Growing the Beard moment. For something similar applied to individual character personality, see Characterization Marches On. A specific sub-trope of this dealing with early installments resembling the real world is Earth Drift. When early characters disappear entirely with no explanations, that's Chuck Cunningham Syndrome (or even Dropped After the Pilot, if it happens in the very first episode). Might be the result of Plot Tumors, Art Evolution and/or Early Installment Character-Design Difference and Continuity Drift.
There will always be some fans who view the current incarnation of a series as They Changed It, Now It Sucks!, but it also must be said that weirdness in this case isn't necessarily a bad thing. Plenty of ideas get scrapped in the natural course of a series, some of them perfectly good. Early Installment Weirdness might be synonymous with a time when a plot was more laid back, experimental, pre-Executive Meddling, pre-Flanderization, or any number of other things. As always, YMMV.
When this happens to themes that become popular after the fact because of a work, and are only actually codified elsewhere, it is a subtrope of Unbuilt Trope.
Compare New First Comics, Lost in Imitation, Early Installment Character-Design Difference, Breaking Old Trends, Adaptation Displacement, and Early Adaptation Weirdness. Contrast First Installment Wins and Later Installment Weirdness. When a character displays this, it's Characterization Marches On (or Flanderization, when it essentially happens in reverse). May be the Oddball in the Series. Often the cause of an Artifact Title. See also Meet Your Early Installment Weirdness.
A special note: In video games, this is often the counterpart to Spiritual Successor. A series may evolve in a drastically different direction from its first installment in a technical sense, abandoning core gameplay mechanics or changing them in drastic ways, while retaining the setting (general background lore, characters, etc.), although elements can be added or retconned. This can happen if the developer for an intellectual property held by a publisher changes or merely if a developer wishes to keep a recognizable, established IP, but adapt to a new player demographic or emulate gameplay seen in another revolutionary title. Such changes result in an early installment weirdness when the sequels are compared with the first installment. In contrast, a game which tries to imitate a forerunner title mostly in gameplay terms (copying/refining particular ""revolutionary"" aspects, the entire gameplay or just the general ""feeling"" of the game), but is not part of the forerunners' IP, e.g. if the rights to the IP are held by a different publisher, and so uses a different setting, it's usually a Spiritual Successor."
t06458,EarnYourHappyEnding,"The basic idea of this trope is that a cast of characters in a story go through a lot more hardship, anguish and grief than is really necessary. In the end, however, you see them get their happily-ever-after. Though humans may act bad and the world may seem like it's a crapsack, that doesn't mean that the worst villain is beyond redemption, or that things can't be improved with hard work or even The Power of Love.
Not to be confused with the Golden Ending in video games, where players actually have to earn their happy ending. It is possible for both tropes to be in play at the same time, however. This trope is a specific example of positive Laser-Guided Karma.
There may be some overlap with Bittersweet Ending or Surprisingly Happy Ending. Compare Earn Your Bad Ending, the polar opposite, and Happily Ever After, a Super-Trope to this.
As this is an ending trope, assume examples will be spoilertastic."
t06490,EasterEgg,"Originally, ""Easter  Congratulations! You found an Easter egg on this page! Eggs"" was the term for little bits of stuff programmers left behind in the software. They're secrets, intended to tickle the fancy of those who discover them. Programs far too numerous to mention have included Easter eggs — everything from Microsoft Office to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.
But Easter Eggs aren't just found in software any more: the term is also used for a variety of hidden content, such as Hidden Tracks on albums and unadvertised DVD Bonus Content, and at one time, for people who sat through the credits (now referred to as The Stinger).
The first Easter Eggs were inserted by programmers for companies whose policy forbade them from receiving individual credit for their work. The earliest Easter Eggs were mostly credits pages, possibly to allow the programmers themselves to prove authorship to friends. For security reasons (and concerns about malicious programmers inserting undocumented and destructive code), most companies don't allow Easter Eggs to appear in their software anymore, but as individual programmers now receive full credit for their work, it's a moot point.note This hasn't stopped programmers from adding them.note Sometimes with negative results.    And… …the problem of software bugs that can come with black box code.
An article on why Easter Eggs exist (focusing on Magic: The Gathering, but applicable to all games) is available here.
In Video Games, Easter Eggs can sometimes be found with a Rocket Jump or a well-timed Double Jump. You can also find some if you use the bunny hop trick. . See? Here's an example of one! Why did you click this anyway? Maybe you should look at the above quote…
For time-sensitive Easter Eggs, see Holiday Mode. For in-story Easter Egg dates that reference original air/release dates, see Significant Reference Date.
Subtropes include Bilingual Bonus (when the audience member must know a language other than the main one of the work to get the extra information) and Freeze-Frame Bonus (an Easter Egg that only appears onscreen for a very brief moment), subtler forms of Foreshadowing (when you go back and discover that minor events or Freeze-Frame Bonus moments tie into events to come), and What the Hell, Player? (an Easter Egg you get for doing something odd in a game).
For many, part of the fun of Easter Eggs is discovering them on one's own, so if you're one of those, beware of spoilers.
See also Shout Outs, which are basically Easter Eggs that are very easy to find."
t06512,EatingOptional,"This trope is a trait of some supernatural beings. These beings are not bound by the natural limitation of needing to feed to survive, yet for one reason or another, they do so anyway.
The being in question might have once been human and eats because they still enjoy the taste of food. Or they might eat because they are among Muggles and need to maintain the Masquerade.
In stranger cases, the being has no need to eat but still hungers. If this is the case, then they can be vulnerable to a Fate Worse than Death. They can be trapped or imprisoned without food indefinitely, forever starving, yet never starving to death.
Such beings also vary in intelligence and in their choice of food. Some are as sentient as any human and enjoy the same foods normal humans do, while others are mindless man-eaters.
If a story has man-eating monsters, then having this trait makes them even more monstrous. Most natural beings eat so they can survive. These guys don't even have that excuse.
A Sub-Trope of The Needless. See also Eating Machine and Perpetual-Motion Monster."
t06593,EldritchAbomination,"The Alien. The Other. The Inconceivable. The Eldritch Abomination is a type of creature defined by its disregard for the natural laws of the universe as we understand them. They are grotesque mockeries of reality beyond comprehension whose disturbing otherness cannot be encompassed in any mortal tongue. Humans suffer Brown Note or Go Mad from the Revelation effects just from witnessing their Alien Geometries. Reality itself warps around them. Any rules that they do follow are beyond our understanding, as are what motives they might have for any of their actions.
Native to the Cosmic Horror Story genre popularized by H. P. Lovecraft, the Eldritch Abomination has become a mainstay of horror and fantasy works, along with numerous others that derive inspiration from Lovecraft. They are often used as a Greater-Scope Villain, Outside-Context Problem, Mad God, Evil God or Sealed Evil in a Can. If it's truely a faithful alien however, it shouldn't even be ""evil"" in the typical sense. As they are defined by existing outside reality as we conceive it, most also come from somewhere beyond the stars or before the dawn of time or outside our universe.
Physically, the Eldritch Abomination is only defined by seeming somehow “off”, hinting at their incomprehensible nature. They can range from humanoid to animalistic to physically impossible to inconceivably bizarre. However, common physical characteristics include similarities to internal organs, genitalia, animals with tentacles, or celestial bodies.
The power of these beings can greatly vary. Some of which can be defeated by mortals, usually via a special weapon specifically meant to kill them, some of which are more powerful than gods, but are often still able to be defeated. In the Cosmic Horror Story genre, however, these beings are usually unbeatable, or are technically beatable, but will result in a Pyrrhic Victory with an incredible cost.
Subtrope of Our Monsters Are Different and Our Monsters Are Weird. Though note that a monster being really powerful, weird or ugly is not, in and of itself, an example of this trope. The monster must break the established internal logic of the work, possibly causing Go Mad from the Revelation.
For specific storylines involving Eldritch Abominations, see the Did You Just Index Cthulhu? page. Compare with God of Evil, The Old Gods, Paradox Person, and Starfish Aliens. When humans are Eldritch Abominations, that's Humans Are Cthulhu. Sub-Trope of Brown Note Being, since eldritch or abomination doesn't describe every creature which causes a Brown Note, nor does every Eldritch Abomination cause one (though it is common for them).
Do not confuse this with Complete Monster, which is more about evil than (physical) monstrousness, especially since a Complete Monster isn't necessarily a literal monster. However, an Eldritch Abomination who has clear agency and is sufficiently heinous by the standards of the story can qualify as a Complete Monster.
Thanks to the nature of this trope, potential Real Life examples are very vague and questionable at best. So No Real Life Examples, Please!"
t06687,EmbarrassingFirstName,"Similar to Embarrassing Middle Name and Embarrassing Last Name, this trope covers instances when a character has a first name that they don't like to be called by. Such characters use a variety of tactics to avoid their real first name:
If the first name is just the beginning in terms of embarrassment, then you might want to file the whole thing under Unfortunate Names. A Giver of Lame Names causes this. If people continue to call the character by that first name anyway, it may lead to a Do Not Call Me ""Paul"" scenario.
Compare Real Joke Name, and Fluffy the Terrible. Contrast ""Awesome McCool"" Name."
t06692,EmbarrassingNickname,"It may be a nickname with a horribly embarrassing story behind it or something family members or lovers use only when they're alone (in which case it overlaps with Affectionate Nickname). It often describes a character's appearance or lack of ability in one area or another. Sexual prowess (or endowment) is a common one. Because it is embarrassing it can be a Berserk Button.
This is not always a comedy trope; the backstory behind the nickname can also apply to a harrowing event from the character's past like a tragic mistake they made - they simply need to be ashamed of the nickname they are now burdened with.
Sub-Trope of In-Series Nickname. Appropriated Appellation is this trope defied. May overlap with Do Not Call Me ""Paul"". See also Accidental Misnaming, Atrocious Alias, Malicious Misnaming, Nobody Calls Me ""Chicken""!, Embarrassing First Name, Insistent Terminology, and Outgrowing the Childish Name."
t06800,EnemyMine,"A shorter form of the Sanskrit proverb ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend."" Another phrase used to describe this is ""War makes for strange bedfellows."" This results in a scenario where foes must work together to achieve a common goal. Note that this is different from Villain Team-Up or Legion of Doom: although all three involve two parties working together to achieve a common goal, this trope usually involves two rivals that have opposing views (such as being good vs being evil) while the latter two involves characters that share similar views (such as both of them are evil), though they don't necessarily like each other.
This type of team-up usually starts with the villain coming to the hero's aid, usually saying that a certain threat is a danger to them both, or ""No one kills you but me!"" when they save the hero from certain doom. May arise from a Mexican Standoff. After the team-up, the villain will usually let the hero live for now because they were so useful, so everything can return to status quo.
Frequently, if it is a goodie-baddie partnership, the baddie will look for opportunities to pull something that gets them a profit (or, in the case of really bad baddies, allows them to stab the goodie in the back). If the villain doesn't betray the hero right away, but there is still animosity between them while they are working together, then you have Teeth-Clenched Teamwork. If the Status Quo is not maintained there could be a creep towards Friendly Enemy status. Can become a Heel–Face Revolving Door if it happens more than once.
Sometimes the baddie is more the hero's Worthy Opponent than a villain and the external threat will be truly evil. In this case, the hero will recognize that the third party is the bigger/more dangerous threat and the Worthy Opponent will be offended that the third party intruded on a 'private game'. Afterwards it's a pity to see them go back to their old rivalry, because together they're an unstoppable fighting force. (If they don't, they've become Fire-Forged Friends.)
A good source of Foe Yay, whether because the villain secretly does harbor feelings for the hero (a direct example) or simply realizes how boring and/or aimless his life would be without them. Compare Embarrassing Rescue, Gondor Calls for Aid. See also Enemy Civil War or Elves vs. Dwarves (with which it often overlaps). Anti-villains are more prone to this trope than most, and less likely to backstab the goodies afterwards.
Finally, this is an opportunity to show the villains as being more competent than they typically are. While they're defeated by the heroes week after week, the bad guys can actually contribute to the defeat of whatever threat they're teaming up with the heroes against.
More short-term deals fall under Cooperation Gambit. When there's no common enemy per se, it's Go-Karting with Bowser. If the villain saves the day without the hero's help, then Bad Guys Do the Dirty Work. If the villain in question is possessing the hero, but there's a greater threat the two must conquer together, this can result in a Symbiotic Possession.
Compare Nominal Hero, a character who fights for good even though their intentions are not heroic at all. Contrast with We ARE Struggling Together, where you have putative allies who end up backstabbing and/or infighting with each other. When this trope is averted completely, one has a Mêlée à Trois or Mexican Standoff. See also An Offer You Can't Refuse, Colliding Criminal Conspiracies, Do Well, but Not Perfect, Genghis Gambit, Inevitable Mutual Betrayal, and Tall Poppy Syndrome. A defining feature of the Standard Sci Fi Setting. May be a result of the Good and the Bad teaming up in a The Good, the Bad, and the Evil scenario. It can be caused by The Horseshoe Effect.
Not to be confused with the Dennis Quaid movie/Barry Longyear story Enemy Mine. We also sincerely hope that you did not have a slip of the finger and ended up here instead of at Enemy Mime. For an enemy that is a mine, see Action Bomb, and for a different kind of mine which is filled with enemies, see Dug Too Deep. As might be gathered by this point, this article is also unrelated to passive defensive weapons planted by one's foes. Also not related to mines of the underground type; for that, see Underground Level or Minecart Madness. Wholly unrelated to Quote Mine, which refers to the propaganda tactic of being very particular in quoting someone the propagandist disagrees with to convey an inaccurate conception of their actual opinion and/or why they said that.
Compare Mediation Backfire, where someone tries to get between two quarreling characters, only for them to put aside their differences to abuse the peacemaker.
Obviously, beware spoilers."
t06811,EnergyBeings,"Creatures that dispense with the need to have a body altogether.
Energy Beings are frequently Sufficiently Advanced or Precursors; in fact, non-physicality is a common prerequisite, though they may take on A Form You Are Comfortable With. Often times this means that when they ""Touch"" a corporeal being it has interesting side effects. Other times they are the result of when a species Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence.
Even cheaper and simpler to pull off than Rubber-Forehead Aliens — they're usually just a blurry blob of light superimposed onto the screen, or maybe a cloud of colored smoke, or they may be outright invisible – which explains why Energy Beings and Human Aliens so often dominate the demographics of the Final Frontier. The Angelic Aliens and Starfish Aliens especially may appear in this form.
Never mind that being ""made of energy"" makes as much sense as being ""made of weight"". This shows that many still don't know what the word ""energy"" really means.
It is also considered nonsensical because ""energy"" beings usually act more like floating clouds of luminescent gas. So a better term to use here might be ""gaseous beings"". Or, they might just plain be made of stars.
They may often be used as a way to represent gods, angels, the afterlife, and similar subjects without dealing with the religious connotations normally attached to them.
Of course, Energy Beings share many characteristics usually ascribed to concepts such as spirits and souls, often making them an example of Sufficiently Analyzed Magic.
See Made of Magic for a more fantastic version.

t06857,EnthrallingSiren,"Sirens are enthralling creatures who lure victims to them through supernatural means. They lure these people to their doom, though not necessarily immediate death. In some versions, their powers only work on men. This detail is entirely Newer Than They Think (for example, Princess Ariadne is killed by sirens in some versions of the myth) and has no basis in the original myths.
They have enthralling voices, while their appearance ranges from very attractive, to very attractive after you've been at sea for a long time, to Glamour or Mind Control covering up a very unsavory reality. If they'll actually change their form to something ideally perfect in the eyes of their victims or at least project a vision of the same, they'll either have some form of Glamour or be a Shapeshifting Seducer. The method they typically also use is Mind-Control Music.
They are at least humanoid, though the lower half is flexible. In Classical Mythology, sirens were women-faced birds, not split up in a manner remotely similar to a centaur. In most modern depictions of sirens the bird characteristics will be dropped and they'll be just beautiful women with beautiful voices, if they aren't mermaids, as bird-women nowadays are usually harpies."
t06883,Epigraph,"An epigraph is the quotation of a line, excerpt or poetry done at the beginning or (more rarely) at the ending of a work, segment or chapter. Frequent in literature, shows up occasionally otherwise.
In written works, epigraphs are often used to make the reader look in a certain direction while reading, or as instructions on how to receive the work. In Speculative Fiction, it is often used to do an Encyclopedia Exposita. Can also be used for an As the Good Book Says... effect.
Super-Trope to Dictionary Opening. See also Pretentious Latin Motto."
t06980,EvenEvilHasStandards,"One of the easiest ways to highlight just how bad something or someone evil is: have an otherwise-remorseless villain reject it.
It's often to show that a new villain is really bad if even Doctor Annihilation is appalled by them. Another way that it's used is to keep a villain safely on the ""still sympathetic"" side of the Moral Event Horizon; give him something that he simply will not do. It may be specifically invoked to prove that it's OK for our hero to work with villains who have standards when the need is great enough. This can be strange if handled badly, with one character objecting to someone's crossing a line even if they have crossed many, many others, leading to confusion and possibly an unintentional edge into Blue and Orange Morality. Why, after all, should a criminal think shooting a particular single orphan be worse than killing every single orphan in the Throwaway Country, or a serial killer be upset by petty theft, or...? This might be deliberate however, in order to show the Moral Myopia of the villains and make the viewers question what is right, what is wrong, and if there even is such a thing as “more wrong”. Also to show how complex human beings can be, what is acceptable for them and what drives them to make different choices in different scenarios. It is particularly ironic when two characters display this and their different understanding of morality by objecting to each other's crossing.
The most common taboos of this type in contemporary Western works involve sexual violence or ill-treatment of children. Or both at once. Common gangster-story examples are to have the Neighbourhood-Friendly Gangsters, by contrast with the Ruthless Foreign Gangsters, refuse to sell illegal drugs or to be disrespectful and abusive in their treatment of the women who they pimp. If your story takes place in a Mob War where one side is slightly better than the other, it's most likely because the ""good"" side has standards. In older works, or historical fiction with authentic moral attitudes, common examples are breaches of Sacred Hospitality, treachery against one's leader, or general breaches of oaths.
The trope title is frequently spouted by the Noble Demon, in order to justify his evil self-identification. The typical format of their declaration is usually along the lines of ""I may be Y, but I am/am not an X Y!""
The Complete Monster in particular has a tendency to provoke invocations of this trope on the part of other villains, due to having zero moral standards and generally being the absolute worst when it comes to villainy.
I Gave My Word is another common variant, which may let the heroes agree to Combat by Champion. Some villains may maintain their standards through use of a Villainous Vow.
Can lead to an Enemy Mine if the evil is another villain. Can also lead to a Pet the Dog moment. Can contribute to making an Anti-Hero or Villain Protagonist A Lighter Shade of Grey than their enemies. Can also make it so that a conflict where both major factions are malicious has someone for the audience to root for. In rare cases, a Heel–Face Turn can even develop from the villain taking a Redemption Quest as a direct result of the conflict (most likely from Heel Realization).
In comedy, it's often used to frame a Take That! against a real-life action (such as digital piracy) or profession (such as lawyer) that the villain is ""too good"" to associate with (or alternatively making fun of those who treat it as a crime); it's sometimes also played for laughs with Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking, where the one thing that the villain objects to is something comically minor compared to their usual crimes. Contrast Moral Myopia and Even Evil Has Loved Ones, where the 'standards' apply only to the villain's allies and Arson, Murder, and Admiration where the eviler one is the better. This trope is one of the distinguishing differences between most villains and The Unfettered.
Compare and contrast Pragmatic Villainy, when the villain's refusal to partake in the abhorrent act is far more selfish (or in the case of a group of villains against a single one, group-beneficial); Eviler Than Thou, where the villain is dismissive of another villain for not being evil enough; Even Mooks Have Loved Ones, where minions defect to protect a loved one from their boss; Do Wrong, Right for cases where it's not what is done but rather how it's done that the villain has standards for; Evil Versus Oblivion, where one villain is trying to defend the world (himself included) against another villain who wants to destroy everything; and Family Values Villain for where the standards are very . . . old fashioned. Often the deal with many Lawful Evil villains, but sometimes not. Can occasionally be the cause of a Break the Badass moment, when the badass in question is the bad guy. As said above it may be used by a character who also crossed the Moral Event Horizon and so he may be, in theory (if not wholly) just as evil as the target of this trope. The Politically Correct Villain always considers themself part of this trope, though whether the writer and audience agree tends to vary.
See also Hitman with a Heart, where this Trope may apply. (Not all characters who fit the Professional Killer Trope are evil depending on their choice of targets, but most are, and a lot do have some scruples. They're particularly likely to have the Even Evil Has Standards variant Selective Slaughter.)
Can even involve Conscience Makes You Go Back, Sudden Principled Stand. See also Evil Virtues and Villainous Valour, for good traits and virtues that villains commonly practice. The inversions of this trope are Well-Intentioned Extremist and Utopia Justifies the Means, when it turns out that goodness is willingly crossing the Moral Event Horizon. This trope is a common trait in Affably Evil characters. On the other hand, while Faux Affably Evil villains do not possess much sincerity, even they could conceivably have their limits. A subtrope of Everyone Has Standards.
No real life examples, please."
t07016,EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep,"A Sub-Trope of No Name Given in which a character is not just a ""victim"" of Only One Name, but is only known by his job title or some other descriptive moniker, or an obscure or odd word that functions as an unusual nickname.
Different from Only Known by Their Nickname, in that it is actually describing what they do. If the character initiates it, it's Spell My Name with a ""The"". May be the result of a Nameless Narrative or Featureless Protagonist. For parents, see Unnamed Parent. Related to They Call Him ""Sword"". Compare/Contrast Race Name Basis when race is used for this and the character may or may not have a name and A Dog Named ""Dog"".
When it's not just a moniker but their actual name, it's the subtrope His Name Really Is ""Barkeep""."
t07139,EvilMatriarch,"A mother is one of the most central figures that a character can have growing up, and her influence can have an impact on that character even as an adult. If the character is lucky, that mother will be a loving one, and if he or she is really lucky, she'll be an Action Mom who can kick ass and take names if the character is ever threatened.
But if the character is really unlucky and isn't suffering from Parental Abandonment, the character's mother will be an Evil Matriarch and chances are, she will make that character's life a living hell.
The Evil Matriarch comes in two forms:
Comedic: Usually used in the Dom Com, this variety is usually the mother of one of the two parents on the show who comes to visit every so often, and someone on the cast dreads it. Usually (though not always) this variety of Evil Matriarch is a meddling parent, often to an irrational extreme. Classically, this is a Mother-in-Law situation, but from time to time, the kids themselves, or even the child of the mother is the one that dreads it. In some cases, everyone hates the Evil Matriarch, like in Malcolm in the Middle where everyone dreads Lois's mother coming to visit. In other cases, her visit is appreciated by everyone but the daughter or son of the Evil Matriarch, like in Family Ties, where the matriarch is evil because her daughter feels she can't live up to mom's perfection. Expect this variety of Evil Matriarch to have Power Hair and other Fashionable Evil.
Dramatic: This variety, which shows up in more dramatic media, is truly evil in a traditional sense, and is one of the worst villains one can face, especially if one of the Heroes or Love Interests is one of her children (or if she's married into his or her family as a stepmother). Many such Evil Matriarchs are completely convinced that they, and only they, know what's best for their children, and can be very controlling, manipulative, and perfectly willing to do anything they deem necessary for their children's sake, no matter how evil or destructive it may be. The most vicious examples of this variety of Evil Matriarch despise their children (or at least the one they've singled out as The Unfavorite) and are often physically or emotionally abusive towards them, and many of them are not above Offing the Offspring.
If she's not entirely human, then expect her to be a Hive Queen. If she is also the Queen, expect God Save Us from the Queen!. If she is just a wanted criminal, then she's just a Notorious Parent.
The Spear Counterpart of this character type is Archnemesis Dad. The inversion is Antagonistic Offspring. See Abusive Parents and Parental Neglect for the more mundane versions. See Offing the Offspring and/or Matricide for what this might lead to if the kids fight back. If it's not your mother but her replacement who's making your life a living Hell, see Wicked Stepmother. If the evil mother in question actually has the word ""mother"" in her villain title, see One Bad Mother."
t07151,EvilParentsWantGoodKids,"Raising children is one of the most daunting challenges a parent can face. You have to supply material needs like food and shelter, as well as providing a moral education by teaching through example. You can see where this would be problematic when a parent supplies the latter by breaking kneecaps or threatening global annihilation.
Some parents make ends meet through frowned-upon trades like prostitution, others turn to crime, some master crime and become The Don, and there's more than a few Super Villains who start families... unintentionally. The thing is, not every villain turned parent is a sociopath who chastises Overlord Jr. for not being evil enough. Quite a few realize the choices they have made, that the life they lead is a fundamentally destructive one, and don't want their child to mimic them as a family legacy.
What ends up happening is that the dad (and it's usually the dad who's the villain) hides his villainy one way or another. The easiest and hardest is to give the child up for adoption or abandon the mother. Non-deadbeats create a Secret Identity where they have a mundane, even boring job. If he doesn't bother hiding his nasty day job, he will either whitewash it to not seem villainous (replace ""mob hit"" with ""rat infestation"", for example) or say ""do what daddy says, not what daddy does"" without a trace of shame. If he's possessive and/or overprotective and has the means to, his children may become a Lonely Rich Kid Mafia Princess who is trapped in a Gilded Cage.
Of course, their kid is going to find out the truth and either be horrified at the Double Standard, or naively eager to become their dad's sidekick. Sometimes, to Dad's dismay, they will prove that villainy is In the Blood despite his best intentions. The realization (and some heroic coercion over revealing the truth to his kids) may lead to pulling a Heel–Face Turn.
Compare White Sheep, Mad Scientist's Beautiful Daughter, Turn Out Like His Father, Give Him a Normal Life, and Little Brother Is Watching. Contrast Daddy's Little Villain and Upbringing Makes the Hero.

t07156,EvilPowerVacuum,"The mindset is this: you see a world without fear, without anger, hate, or war. And then you go and conquer that world, because they'd never expect it.
So, the Big Bad is done for. Maybe they Never Found the Body, or maybe s/he's finally been Killed Off for Real. But for some reason, the series of events hasn't ended yet.
The Evil Power Vacuum occurs when a Big Bad is, at long last, seemingly taken down by the good guys or an outside group. The result is usually a sort of ""power scramble"" amongst the good guys, the bad guys, and every allegiance in between, as each group tries to come out on top. Tyrant Takes the Helm is when a revolution or a coup dethrones an old evil leader, only for a new — possibly worse — evil to take its place.
This is sometimes the result of Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!, especially if the chaos following the Big Bad's fall is worse than anything he ever did.
See also Balance Between Good and Evil, Enemy Civil War, Asskicking Equals Authority, Dragon Ascendant, and The Starscream. Preventing this trope is often a reason for Better the Devil You Know and Vetinari Job Security. See also Cosmic Keystone if the new evil that takes the villain's place was kept contained by said villain's existence."
t07200,ExactWords,"When the exact wording of a rule, promise, prophecy, etc. matters more than the spirit of the wording, it's an Exact Words situation.
The Knight Templar, the Anti-Hero, and those with even looser standards (but some standards) will often stick to Exact Words even as they declare I Gave My Word. A common trait of Lawful Evil characters. Also a common (and not always evil) way to play with Just Following Orders or the Leonine Contract. Undercover heroes often tell the Big Bad that ""Your operation is very impressive, and you deserve everything that's coming to you"" — both of which are true, without specifying what exactly is coming their way.
The Obstructive Bureaucrat will insist on them as if the Vast Bureaucracy would fall apart if exceptions were made. The Beleaguered Bureaucrat will often insist on them, when the exceptions really would be a problem.
For magical enforcement, see Literal Genie. Often the cause of Prophecy Twist. Literal-Minded characters just do it because that's how they think. Can be defended against with Legalese, though might be used (and horribly abused) by a Rules Lawyer. If someone follows established rules to annoy someone else, it becomes Bothering by the Book. If this trope is related to or defines a superpower, it's called a Semantic Superpower.
Subtrope of Double Meaning. Compare Heroic Vow, I Would Say If I Could Say, and Ironic Echo. Unhand Them, Villain! is a specific variant. Threat Backfire is a common result. It's very commonly used in False Reassurance. The actual interpretation of the words is often Not Hyperbole. When used in response to a question can often result in a Mathematician's Answer. Can also lead to a Literal Metaphor and to Literalist Snarking, as well as Loophole Abuse. Also see No Man of Woman Born. Contrast with I Lied, for when the opposing party makes no effort to hide the fact that they were not holding to their end. Not to be confused with Literal-Minded.
The Exact Words are also the difference between a riddle and a mere common question.
Spoilers ahead."
t07317,Expy,"An expy (short ""exported character"") is a character from one series who is unambiguously and deliberately based on a character in another, older series. A few minor traits, such as age or hair color, may change, but there's no doubt that they are almost one and the same. They often turn up in different works by the same writer(s) or production team.
This can simply be the tendency of writers to prefer certain characterizations for important characters (or knowing which ones are most marketable/popular), or the influence of the design process. On the other hand, it may just be a bad attempt to try to revive a character who the writer liked, but nobody else did and had to get rid of it. When by a different author, it may be an homage to the original creator and/or character or because the author did not have the rights to use the work and wanted to avoid copyright or trademark infringement issues. In the negative sense, an expy can be seen as just a bloated, gimmicky version of a perfectly serviceable past character. In a positive sense, it can refer to an ""upgrade"" of a two-dimensional or otherwise limited character to one more appreciably complex.
Remember that Tropes Are Not Bad; an expy can give an old character concept a new lease on life, take it in a different direction, adapt it to a new medium, or simply do something with it that's as good or better than the original. Iconic characters like Yogi Bear and Mickey Mouse are obvious clones of Art Carney and Felix the Cat respectively, but that hasn't stopped them from being among the most acclaimed cartoon characters of all time.
Theory: any Characters as Device trope, if taken to the extreme, can result in the character appearing to be a mere expy of the Trope Codifiers for that trope. Especially if the character is Flanderized to the point of having few defining characteristics outside of the trope they represent. See Fountain of Expies.
Most often seen in animation and video games, where it's much easier to make a newer character resemble an older one. Occasionally happens when characters from different stories end up sharing voice actors, making or even forcing their personalities to look even more similar, which often leads to jokes based on the voice actor's former role.
When the character appears in the same series as the previous character, they're often a Suspiciously Similar Substitute.
The key difference between this and Captain Ersatz is that an Expy uses the other character as a starting point before going in their own direction, while Captain Ersatz is obviously the same character but with the Serial Numbers Filed Off. Please keep this distinction in mind before adding an example here. Also note that a fictional counterpart to a real-life person would be either No Celebrities Were Harmed or a Shout-Out, depending on the intent. A quick glance around TV Tropes will reveal just how often these mistakes are made on this very wiki.
Remember that an Expy must be a clearly deliberate reference on the part of the author; superficial or random coincidental similarities (even very striking ones) do not qualify, so if you aren't certain, they probably are not an Expy. Because many character archetypes and tropes that compose characters are universal, it is easy for readers to fall into thinking that a particular character in the same general archetype resembles someone from their favorite show or novel, especially when Small Reference Pools lead readers to overestimate the cultural impact of their favorite characters.
Spiritual Successor is a similar trope scaled up to an entire work, and thus as a result often features Expies of characters from the original work.
Compare to Bleached Underpants, Alternate Company Equivalent, Name's the Same, Roman à Clef, Similar Squad, Same Story, Different Names, Suspiciously Similar Song, Distaff Counterpart, Surprisingly Similar Stories, Evil Counterpart, Whole Plot Reference. Not to be confused with XP, nor XP.
Compare Fantastic Fauna Counterpart, which is sort of the animal equivalent: a fictional (or extinct) species of animal is clearly meant to be the counterpart of a real-life species, but at the same time is clearly not the same species.
Contrast In Name Only, Transplanted Character Fic.
For specific characters that tend to inspire expies, see Fountain of Expies. For a series with numerous different expies in its cast, see Cast of Expies. When an expy and the character that inspired are both found in the same universe, then you have Expy Coexistence."
t07348,ExtremeDoormat,"Humble, quiet, obedient, stoic; the Extreme Doormat is all of these virtues...and that's all they are. A doormat, for those who do not know the slang expression, is someone who lets other people walk all over them. They lack drive, ambition, and even opinions. Something about them just drives them to make everyone happy even at the expense of their own happiness and kowtow to every order and insult they're given, no matter how ridiculous or unfair it may be to them.
Naturally, such a narratively-empty character won't start drama, so they're usually a Satellite Character, Battle Butler, trusty companion, or part of a love harem for the more active hero. Part of being the Extreme Doormat is they will obey just about any command from their love/hero/superior officer short of the suicidal ones (and sometimes even those). Sometimes, this can result from an Empty Shell with combat training under Mind Control.
A common plot for the Extreme Doormat is the discovery or growth of their own personality and backbone. Be it by having a true friend Teach Him Anger, confronting their (ab)user or being the subject of Character Development or even a Mook–Face Turn when the hero who treats them nicely encourages them to abandon a boss who doesn't, or a ""lover"" who keeps them dependent. Frequently Apologises a Lot.
Often the victim of those Taking Advantage of Generosity.
Contrast Yamato Nadeshiko and Silk Hiding Steel, both of which appear to be this trope but have a hidden, ironclad backbone, and Hair-Trigger Temper, who will overreact about anything. Compare and contrast Love Martyr, which is, mostly, not this trope."
t07399,EyeScream,"The more squeamish members of our audience may not wish to read further. We recommend you go here for a while instead. Thank you, and have a nice day.
The eyes are our window to the world. We rely mostly on our sight to tell us about the world — its wonders, its dangers, and its beauty (unless you're blind). At the same time, our eyes are mostly made of water and nerve tissue. Which means that most direct attacks on the eyes, especially with a sharp, pointy object, will destroy them.
Ah. Made you wince, didn't it?
The Eye Scream is when the creator of a work takes advantage of our Primal Fear of having something utterly horrible happen to our eyes, usually involving the invasion of the eye sockets by a foreign body, and plays it up for all its worth; all its squishy, bloody, traumatic worth. Academically, this is known as the Injury to the Eye Motif.
An interesting commonality in these examples is that one of the best ways to quickly show a character has gone completely off the deep end is to show them mutilating their own eyes.
Usually accompanied with Reflective Eyes, so we can get a nice and nasty glimpse of the incoming foreign object. See also Go for the Eye, A Handful for an Eye, Moe Greene Special, Forced to Watch, and Eye Poke. Likewise, a Groin Attack can invoke the same primal reaction. Compare Fingore, Agony of the Feet and Ear Ache. Contrast Eyes Are Unbreakable. If the character survives it often results in an Eyepatch of Power.
In Real Life, this will usually kill you unless you can get immediate medical attention, due to blood loss and shock.
Has nothing to do with Eyed Screen, apart from both being Eye Tropes."
t07414,FaceHeelTurn,"A good guy turns bad, the opposite of the Heel–Face Turn. The ways in which this happens are many:
This is the Evil Counterpart to the more common Heel–Face Turn and is generally found in a story with Black and White Morality. The many reasons and the probability for a turn are listed in the Sorting Algorithm of Face-Heel Turning.
In a world full of Brainwashed victims, they may be the one who appears to be but really is Not Brainwashed.
The term ""Face Heel Turn"" comes from Professional Wrestling, in which a ""good"" wrestler (a face) is occasionally tempted by The Dark Side, or just gets fed up, and becomes a heel. Magazines and other promotional material from the various wrestling ""leagues"" frequently comment on various wrestlers' changes in ""alignment"" (in wrestling's fictional plotline known as kayfabe) nearly as frequently as they actually cover events in the ring themselves. (They even use phrases like ""Face Heel Turn"", though the shorter ""Heel Turn"" is more common.)
A wrestler's heel turn is often a sign that he or she is about to see his or her popularity skyrocket. Indeed, it is very common, once they have turned, to remain heels for their entire careers. Heels that become really popular may end up ""naturally"" becoming faces again, but it is just as likely for heels to be beloved because they are heels. In fact, as paradoxical as it might seem, a heel turn can help an otherwise despised wrestler become likable: fans may well resent a face character, and may be better able to relate to a character who is profoundly flawed in one way or another. (After all, that's what satire is all about.)
Note that a Face–Heel Turn is harder to pull off than a Heel–Face Turn - at least convincingly. If a character is introduced as likable and heroic, it takes some good writing to properly take them through the Character Development required to become the villain. Simply Foreshadowing that a character could turn evil is not enough. The work has to be put in to get the character to that destination; there are plenty of wrestling examples where this hasn't been done, or the reasons for the turn are so badly thought out that the fans reject it, and the wrestler turns back face shortly after.
Contrast:
Compare Protagonist Journey to Villain, a plot which utilizes this trope as the entire character and story arc. Big Bad Slippage, where the Big Bad does this over the course of the story, is a Sub-Trope.
See also Heel–Face Revolving Door, Neutral No Longer, Deal with the Devil, We Used to Be Friends, Start of Darkness and Et Tu, Brute?. If the turn takes place extremely abruptly, it may include Jumping Off the Slippery Slope.
Not to be confused with Evil All Along, in which a character that was thought to be good was evil all along. This trope describes a legitimate hero going to the darkside, not a Double Agent.
Due to the nature of this trope, MAJOR UNMARKED SPOILERS ahead!
In real-life the nature of Heel–Face Turn and Face-Heel Turn is subjective (one person's ""seeing the light"" is another person's ""heartless betrayal"" depending on what group the individual is going to or leaving). Therefore, No Real Life Examples, Please!"
t07437,FacialMarkings,"Gods, demons, high priestesses and almost any other variety of being more powerful than the usual schmoe in the street will be indicated by convenient facial markings, usually in the center of their forehead, on their cheeks, or both. These will often tell the perceptive viewer the owner's moral and ethical alignment (or lack thereof), their team affiliation, and maybe even their tax bracket. If their markings change when they use powers (or more power than they should), it's a Marked Change.
In many series, androids may have an obvious mark that allows humans to instantly identify them as a robot. Sometimes this is a functional item, as in Chobits (see Unusual Ears).
Sometimes, they might simply be tattoos that are rarely commented on, maybe hinted to be clan/regional markers.

That's all well and good for ordinary disasters, but when a Third Eye gets smacked with a half-brick of the end of all things, getting the gravitas across takes a fit. Screams, spasms, visible exhaustion, malfunctioning seer's tools, it's all good. Fainting is not required but makes for a suitably dramatic finish.
Sometimes the interruption means that the prophecy in question is incomplete — in some cases when the seer dies or the props are destroyed, it's because an interested third party is trying to hide the outcome. What all this amounts to is a psychic version of The Worf Effect, and is equally popular with telepaths and empaths. You know shit's serious when the team psi keels over in the middle of a scan.
A Fainting Seer clearly has some actual power: fakes value customer satisfaction. Nothing spoils a date at the fair like a fortune-teller who starts screaming about death, DEATH, oblivion shrouding the land with its brimstone veil, yea, the very HEAVENS dripping with human gore, aaaiiiigh... etc.
A variation on My Significance Sense Is Tingling. Frequently paired with The Force Is Strong with This One and Poke in the Third Eye. Can be related to or cause even be the cause of Mad Oracle. Can overlap with Power-Strain Blackout. If trouble happens a lot — compare The Ophelia.
Historically, this was an Invoked Trope in many ancient traditions due to the common view that narcolepsy or epilepsy (both commonly referred to as ""the falling/sleeping sickness"") were signs that one was gifted with prophesy.
See Post-Victory Collapse when the hero breaks down due to physical or mental exhaustion. Subtrope of Fainting."
t07554,FakingTheDead,"A character's death is faked, for one or more of the following purposes:
Often the audience will think the character is genuinely dead. Extra points if a fake crime scene photo or Staged Shooting is used. Sometimes a John Doe's remains are substituted and destroyed beyond recognition, or everyone is simply told 'They Never Found the Body.' The person faking his death might attend his own funeral. Of course, when this happens to main characters in a series, the audience should not be fooled.
When the method of faking temporarily turns the character into a realistic-seeming corpse, this is Faux Death.
Death Faked for You, Playing Possum, and Fake Kill Scare are subtropes. The inverse is Of Corpse He's Alive (a ""live"" person is actually dead) and El Cid Ploy (a faction pretending their leader is alive).
A play on the common turn of phrase ""waking the dead"". Contrast He's Just Hiding!. Not to be confused with Fake Weakness. See also Reports of My Death Were Greatly Exaggerated.
For what (usually) happens next, see Starting a New Life.
Remember that faking the dead may seem fun, but it is a criminal act in most countries and may cause legal trouble. Don't Try This at Home.
BEWARE OF UNMARKED SPOILERS. You Have Been Warned."
t07680,FantasticDrug,"If you need an addictive or psychedelic substance for a storyline, there's always one old standby: make one up. This meshes perfectly with Speculative Fiction, but would seem completely out of place in a realistic series. After all, the planet ""Yalic 4"" might not have the same plants or minerals etc. that a fictional analogue of Earth would. Alternatively, if it's a comedy, you could get away with I Can't Believe It's Not Heroin! instead. Otherwise you can resort to the potentially narmy G-Rated Drug.
Aside from a writer's hesitancy to show a beloved character using drugs, Media Watchdogs often cracked down on any depiction of drugs (even if they were negative) for many years. Lately it's been reduced to ""heavily sanctioned"" at best, creating the unfortunate irony that incorrect portrayal of the effect of drugs has made audiences more liable to dismiss the true effects of drugs as propaganda.
In Real Life, these are known as ""designer drugs"", for people who want to get high without using technically illegal street drugs.
Often can be the Spice of Life. Compare Super Serum. Not to be confused (usually) with Psycho Serum. Addictive Magic is closely related. Compare Alien Catnip when a mundane substance proves a drug to aliens."
t07717,FantasyCounterpartCulture,"Creating a completely new culture from scratch can be a daunting task. Think about everything the word culture encompasses—music, food, clothing, etiquette, dance, religion, and combative traditions, to name a few, and even if one manages to pull it off, one runs the risk of ruining audience's Suspension of Disbelief by having one's creation seem too strange. To lighten the burden of creating a believable fictional culture creators often base one or more of their creations off of real human cultures from various times or places. The countries may have significant names resembling the place they are based on.
This is especially common in fantasy settings, but by no means exclusive to it. It's also often found in satire, as a means of indirectly poking fun at the culture in question.
There are also sound literary reasons for using this trope. Making the Shire an idealized England transplanted to Middle-Earth makes it easier for readers to identify with the point of view characters, since they probably have much more in common with Bilbo than with Thorin. Guy Gavriel Kay's The Lions of Al-Rassan is a thinly disguised historical novel, but changing the names of the countries and religions means the readers don't know how the story will end, helping to maintain dramatic tension.
It's also more easily justified in works containing humans: the Real Life counterparts of the fictional cultures have all actually come into existence and are the results of real groups of people coming together to build something over time. Basing a new society on one that's already had a turn at some point in human history can both help the audience relate and provide a creative framework to twist and turn said society into an interesting variant of its former self. However this approach still has its risks — if the Fantasy Counterpart Culture is based on a too simplistic view of a particular region of the world, it ends up lacking both in depth and originality.
Compare with Istanbul (Not Constantinople), when a real place is referred to with a more archaic or obscure name (e.g. ""Columbia"" instead of ""USA""). Compare also with Days of Future Past, where a futuristic society duplicates (often explicitly and intentionally) the culture and styles of a historical period. Compare with No Communities Were Harmed, which is this applied to a locality, and Fantasy Counterpart Religion for when is applied to a religious group. Compare Fantastic Fauna Counterpart for a similar concept applied to animals, i.e. an animal species being used as a substitute for another.
See also Culture Chop Suey, Space Romans (and the more offensive version, Space Jews). A Nazi by Any Other Name, Medieval European Fantasy and Wutai are frequently-occurring specific types of fantasy counterpart culture."
t07789,FateWorseThanDeath,"Think death is the cruelest fate? Think again. There are several things much worse: torture, taxes, and tofu, to name but a few. And more often than not, some unfortunate soul will experience it. Originally, this phrase meant rape, but now there's even worse than that.
This phrase is usually used in a Just Between You and Me moment by the Evil Overlord as they boast about the agony-inducing Death Trap that awaits the hero for delaying their plans. It's also fairly commonly used as a warning to the hero against seeking forbidden power or knowledge, and consequently to foreshadow the particular Karmic Death the villain will suffer because of meddling with the universe's Cosmic Keystone.
If the victim is immortal, this fate may even replace death, which might suck royally.
Mercy Killings are common when heroes find anyone in this state. If the character can beg for help, I Cannot Self-Terminate occurs; if they can act on their own, they are often Driven to Suicide. Indeed, since all involve choosing death over a given fate, the characters often conclude that that fate is worse than death. Contrast Cruel and Unusual Death, for when the victim instead gets a gruesome death that sucks beyond telling.
Compare Cruel Mercy, Empty Shell, To the Pain, The Punishment, Room 101, Tailor-Made Prison, and Cool and Unusual Punishment. For extreme examples of this trope, see And I Must Scream. Not to be confused with A Fête Worse Than Death, though the two can occasionally overlap."
t07804,FauxAffablyEvil,"A villain whose politeness is an act that only serves to enhance their evil. Unlike Affably Evil characters, whose niceness is genuine despite their malice, these villains adopt this pleasant persona. They lack a villainous demeanor, yet they are truly, wholly, and unrepentantly evil regardless. This kind of villain maintains a friendly, courteous mask even as they commit incredibly heinous acts. An Affably Evil villain will treat The Hero like a friend, genuinely regret having to fight them, and seriously try to win them over. A Faux Affably Evil villain will say, ""You know, I always look forward to our little meetings"" while gruesomely torturing them for fun.
At heart, they're utterly soulless, but they mask it with a pleasant, polite, ""normal"" attitude, perhaps because they have social standards to live up to or because their pleasantness reflects their sheer enjoyment of evil. Maybe it's a sign of their severely warped morality, or a form of deception or psychological warfare. Or maybe they're just unbearably full of themselves. It's anyone's guess what this kind of villain will do if they suffer a Villainous Breakdown; maybe they will drop all pretenses and find that they are Not So Above It All or maybe they will fall into a state of Dissonant Serenity, blabbering off-kilter pseudo-mannerisms as they lapse into their final and greatest puppy-murdering spree.
Do not confuse with Laughably Evil, which is a villain who is funny rather than polite. While many Faux Affably Evil villains are also Laughably Evil, many other villains are one but not the other. Compare and contrast Affably Evil (whose niceness is sincere) and this Trope's opposite, Noble Demon (whose demeanor is evil in contrast to their actions). For the Evulz is a common motivation, though using this trope as a form of Obfuscating Stupidity is also possible. Also see its (possibly) downplayed counterpart Bitch in Sheep's Clothing, where a Jerkass at the best of times, is hiding behind a Nice Guy facade in order to trick people and doesn't necessarily keep it after showing his real face, and Stepford Smiler, when a miserable and/or mentally unstable person is hiding behind a cheery and sweet facade. May also overlap with Soft-Spoken Sadist, Sugary Malice, Wise Old Folk Facade.
Contrast with Good Is Not Nice, which is a good character that just isn't polite. Not to be confused with Wicked Cultured where a cultured façade hides unpleasant behavior. This trope is also one of the defining traits of a sociopath."
t07939,FieryRedhead,"A Fiery Redhead is a red-haired character who is strong, Hot-Blooded, outgoing, usually outspoken, and (if a love interest) often female. She has a big personality and she's not afraid to use it. Whatever you do, don't get on her bad side, or there will be hell to pay. (Especially if powers of personality and/or elements are present: she likes Playing with Fire. Thus, in a Four-Temperament Ensemble, expect her to be Choleric.) She will be unladylike unless it's the case of a redheaded Spirited Young Lady. She might be One of the Boys, a tomboy, or a lad-ette. Heroes do like redheads after all.
This hair-color stereotype probably developed since red hair was associated with the Irish and Scottish (and before this, Horny Vikings) for a long time, and they ended up being stereotyped as loud, strong, and passionate (see the Fighting Irish and Violent Glaswegian tropes for more info on that). On the other hand, it's even found in Eastern Europe where any association would have been with Russians or Swedes, and these are nationalities not generally stereotyped as hotheaded.
In addition to this, it extends even into ancient texts from Babylonian and Scandinavian Oral Historian. In the Prose Edda, Odin is depicted as blonde, green-eyed, cool, and calculating — while his son, Thor, is a redheaded, blue-eyed (something of an omen of war/perfection in Scandinavian culture) fire-breathing stereotypical Viking (the raiding kind) who treats Earth as a giant freshman mixer. Gilgamesh is also a Fiery Redhead with blue eyes whose duties include being a good precursor to Thor, for the most part — though with more reservation and a cooling trend near the end of his life (this makes both an eerie paradigm of Fiery Redheads at the creation of their respective people's writings). The whole ""red-haired, blue-eyed"" thing is usually split in Japan between two people.
Although real redheads can have tempers like everyone else, this trait is exaggerated in fiction. Also, they can have green eyes and this association is also exaggerated in fiction.
Compare Heroes Want Redheads, Dark-Skinned Redhead, Evil Redhead, Rose-Haired Sweetie, Red-Headed Stepchild, Redheads Are Uncool, Red Is Heroic. In anime, could be a Shana Clone. If you have a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead in close proximity (i.e. in the main cast), it's Blonde, Brunette, Redhead. Contrast Shy Blue-Haired Girl for Red Oni, Blue Oni and Eerie Pale-Skinned Brunette for the realistic opposite hair color and personality.
Please do not confuse this with a redhead being literally fiery, or having literal fiery head, although these tropes may overlap. And a red who's literally firey does have their hair color fit their elemental powers. See also Red Is Violent (in this case, the hair color)."
t08044,Fingore,"Eyes, teeth, tongues, throats, feet and genitalia are not the only human body parts that are extremely sensitive and fragile. Our fingers are, too. This trope includes all the nasty things that can happen to them:
What makes fingers so attractive for horror writers is that unlike the eyes, we generally have ten of them. The fun lasts five times longer! And that's not counting the toes.
Also, most people can relate to finger and toe injuries, since they tend to be very common in everyday life. This makes finger severing and other injuries a lot more cringe-inducing than something as over the top as limb dismemberment or decapitation. Most people have no idea how something like that would feel, but we pretty much all can imagine what a having a section of your finger cut off would feel like, and it seems very unpleasant.
There's also the fact that in humans, fingers have the highest number of touch receptors of any part of the body, primarily as an evolutionary consequence to the human species' tool biased survival strategy that required the use of the hands. As a result, fingers are so sensitive they could even be considered to be sensory organs on par with the eyes. The loss of hands can also be extremely disabling for the same reasons above, just as the loss of an eye can be.
The same thing can also happen to the toes. This is nastier than people may assume, as losing even minor toes can cause serious damage to people's ability to walk and balance.
See Mutilation Interrogation for Cold-Blooded Torture that often involves this. For this done as a ritual, see Yubitsume. Fingers are a fairly common Creepy Souvenir.
Compare An Arm and a Leg, where an entire limb is lost; and Impaled Palm, where the handpalm is pierced by some object.
Contrast, among other things, Intertwined Fingers."
t08047,FinishingEachOthersSentences,"We've all heard it before... literally. Some people know each other so well, they finish each other's sentences. The effect is usually a demonstration of how close the two people are — they're so familiar with one another, they even think alike. (That purpose is the last in the following list of purposes.)
Generally comes in two forms— the single line and the complex dialogue. The single line goes something like,
The complex dialogue is more elaborate:
Closeness and familiarity aren't the only reason for this trope. Others include:
This trait is often found in Creepy Twins, Single-Minded Twins, and Sickeningly Sweethearts, but hardly restricted to them— lovers, parents, siblings, friends, co-workers, enemies, even strangers can do this. And while we're at it, it doesn't have to be only two— loads of people can get in on the act, although it might start to stretch credibility. Also present as a way of showing that two characters are telepathic or are parts of a Hive Mind.
If the characters are built around this trope, it's a sign of a big problem when they don't finish each other's sentences. If one character is a psychic, expect the other to shout something like, ""Get out of my head!"" Or even if they aren't psychic, if it happens often enough.
A similar effect is having characters Finish Dialogue in Unison. Two Scenes, One Dialogue and Distant Duet have characters finishing each other's sentences without even being in the same scene. Compare Strange Minds Think Alike, Catchphrase Interruptus, Speak in Unison."
t08100,FirstPersonSmartass,"So it turns out we need to have an article about the First-Person Smartass, and now I have to tell you everything about the type of narrator who's a first-person narrator (because you obviously didn't get that from the name) and describes events in the tone of a Deadpan Snarker. He does this since he knows that, contrary to the popular misconception, narration isn't about, y’know, letting the reader in on the plot; it's about sharing with them every remotely entertaining half-of-a-train of thought you have.
This guy sometimes shows up in the Private Eye Monologue sort of work, but Urban Fantasy is where you really can't turn a corner without bumping into a dozen of them. If you want to find one, just cast a fireball in some otherwise normal city and before you're halfway done, some wannabe-protagonist will jump at you from behind a corner and start throwing pithy remarks at you about how you're being cliché and violating the laws of thermodynamics or some shit like that.
Well, fine, that's...hyperbole, I suppose...but you have to admit the guy is an awfully convenient proxy to have around if you're a clever author who wants to show the world how clever you are. Not to mention he can also function as an Audience Surrogate, incorporating and defusing a reader's skepticism with endless Lampshade Hanging of whatever bits of the story don't make sense. You can almost feel the enormous weight of the entire story's Willing Suspension of Disbelief crushing this poor bastard’s shoulders.
You can expect this guy to be intellectual and well-acquainted with pop culture (or at least works with which the author is familiar), so he can make all the right clever references at the right time. Naturally, this won't prevent them from being described as uneducated, bad at school, or just plain Book Dumb; these traits are apparently all the fucking rage for Audience Surrogates nowadays as people can't identify with someone who might possibly be a better person than they are. Unfortunately the character may end up being too smart, because the writer is afraid of looking stupid. In the case of Fan Fiction, a character of only moderate intelligence may end up being given uncharacteristically intelligent thoughts, and leaving the readers with a sense of OOC-ness.
Anyways, the Trope Namer was a review of Steven Brust's Dragaera series by The Library of Babel. And of course you're going to click that, because the ""click hither and educate thyself"" tone of that sentence just screams ""fun.""
Compare Lemony Narrator. Or don’t, I don’t care how lazy you are.
...I don’t like my job."
t08132,FiveManBand,"The Five-Man Band is a group of characters whose members fall into archetypes which all complement one another. They are a very specific team with skills that contribute to the group in a way oddly analogous to the members of a rock band. It can sometimes literally be a musical group, but much more often is not.
The group traditionally includes:


The five-man rock band phenomenon, four guys and a girl singer, is no longer as current as it once was. It was very hard to escape in the 60's and 70's. However, the group structure, as you will see in the examples, turns up in a lot of storytelling. Like a whole lot of storytelling.
See also ¡Three Amigos!, Power Trio, and Cast Calculus. Fighting ability is usually determined by Fixed Relative Strength. Compare the Command Roster, for military-esque teams. The Psycho Rangers are the collective Evil Counterpart of a given Five-Man Band. See also Four-Temperament Ensemble.
These are examples of teams that fit all five of the character tropes. Remember that they form a team dynamic; it's always tempting to match two of the characters in a show, then try to convince yourself and others that the other characters can be squeezed/wedged/stuffed into the description of the other character types, but that's not the point of the Five-Man Band trope. The individual character types exist outside of the band. The Five-Man Band only occurs when the team as a whole fits, not just a few characters.
As a rule of thumb, if your band example has to justify more than two types, or a single trope with more than two sentences of qualifiers, you're trying to fool yourself. If it isn't a Five-Man Band, it isn't a Five-Man Band."
t08299,Foil,"Jewelers often put shiny metal foil underneath a gem to make the stone shine brighter. A literary foil serves a similar purpose. This character highlights someone else's trait, usually by contrast.
Sidekicks often serve as foils to the hero by being something the hero himself is not. A calm and pragmatic sidekick when the hero is hotheaded, for example. In the classic good-guy versus bad guy scenario, both the hero and villain can each be considered the other's foil, in that each acts to show how the other behaves in certain situations.
These are far from the only possible pairings, however, as virtually any story with multiple characters can contrast the characters to show greater depths to them, regardless of what side they are on in the good versus evil equation. Good versus evil doesn't have to come into the picture at all.
Interaction between the characters is key for a pair of characters to qualify as an example. A pair of foils need not have an established relationship before the story begins, but they need to come together at some point in the story and let their opposed personalities contrast one another. Otherwise, we'd just have a list of characters who have opposed personality traits.
If you've got a series where a hero from a later installment is the opposite of a hero from earlier on, they've got to interact with each other somewhere in the series for them to count as foils. Otherwise, you've got a Contrasting Sequel Main Character. The same goes for the baddies: Unless the contrasting villain from the earlier installment interacts with the villain from the later installment, you're looking at a Contrasting Sequel Antagonist.
Sometimes a foil is a flat or Bit Character, a secondary character that comes on stage, sparks a response, then fades from the story. More often, though, the foil is a recurring character that has a personality, or an opinion of things, that is different from another recurring character. This character can be the opposite of the character in many ways — or perhaps very, very, very similar, except for a crucial difference.
Many intentional foils are depicted as physical contrasts to the main character, though a contrasting appearance alone isn't sufficient for a character to be a foil. Thin vs. fat and tall vs. short are among the most common ways of setting up a contrast. Similarly, when the heroine's hair is blonde or white, the villain tends to have dark or red hair; when the villain is blond or white haired, the hero tends to be dark or red haired. Opposing genders and races are common even in modern media, but often tend to be handled more delicately due to these types of differences being an Unfortunate Implications minefield.
As implied earlier, virtually any two characters or character types can serve as foils to each other if they're put together properly and a little good writing goes into them. However, there is a surprisingly large number of character types that exist primarily for the purpose of being a foil, usually to the main character, or in the case of a set of characters, to each other.
If you're feeling a little poetic and look around at your surroundings enough, you'll probably discover that this trope is a bit of Truth in Television.
Nothing to do with fencing or the preferred headgear of (or preferred insult against) a Conspiracy Theorist. See also Duo Tropes.
Compare Shadowland, which applies to settings, and Spiritual Antithesis, which applies to works."
t08330,FoodPorn,"Food porn is two things:
The second has probably existed forever, but the first is a trope primarily popularized by the modern Cooking Show, advertising, and other visual media where the food is the main focus. In visual media, the presentation goes beyond edutainment or straightforward depictions of the food and tantalizes the viewer with careful close-up shots of artfully arranged dishes or the pristine appearance of their raw ingredients, choreographed action shots of its preparation and accompanying moans of pleasure produced by the people eating them. In written media, the same can be accomplished by writing at great length about the food in a similar manner.
The production of professional, high-octane food porn is an involved process. These articles go into detail of the technique and principles. The camera operators borrow a lot of techniques from the conventions of actual porn: ""pornographic gaze"", extreme close-ups with shallow depth of field, careful cropping and lighting, soft focus, even shapes and arrangement vaguely resembling parts of anatomy. Erotic Eating isn't this trope, but may be employed in it. The fact that the perfect food presented to the camera will be unobtainable to most people only adds to the porn appeal. Like real porn, there are also thousands of amateur examples, as plugging the term into a Flickr search will quickly illustrate.
Alas, as in real porn, many of these orgasmic delights are photo shopped or faked. This is especially true in commercialsnote though by law they have to show the actual food being sold; the cereal may be real but the milk is white glue, the lettuce in the burger is protected by a hidden piece of cardboard..., but it is also necessary: under hot studio lights, frozen foods will melt, hot foods go cold, cereal gets soggy, veggies wilt. Cooking shows, cookbooks and food magazines, on the other hand, will generally show you the real deal, even though it has been gone over by a stylist to look as good as it can. If you've ever puzzled over the term ""food stylist"" in credits, that's what this person does.
While food porn may be decadent, exotic or sinful, food porn by itself isn't Not Safe for Work (Not Safe For Diets, on the other hand...), and doesn't involve sex. This is not to say it can't be combined or used in ways with actual sex appeal. Also no relation to aphrodisiacs.
Compare Impossibly Delicious Food, Supreme Chef, Erotic Eating (where the act of eating the food is a blatant Visual Innuendo), Delicious Distraction or Orgasmically Delicious (In-Universe versions), Nutritional Nightmare (where you take unhealthy foods and make them even more unhealthy). See also Costume Porn and Scenery Porn.
Contrast Alien Lunch, Nausea Fuel, and Poverty Food."
t08350,ForbiddenZone,"In Speculative Fiction, there is always at least one area with a foreboding name that nobody goes to. Ever. Whether it's an impassable swamp, an asteroid field, a city rumored to be haunted, a monster-infested mountain passage or simply a place the elders have declared off limits, this is the place everybody knows you only go to when you're insane. The mundane examples may simply be a Wretched Hive brimming with thugs and cut-throats. At the most extreme cases it is an outright Eldritch Location.
So, naturally, the heroes will inevitably wind up going there — whether by choice or circumstance. What good is having something that's mysteriously off limits if we can't go there and see why it's off limits? Chances are the dangers are completely exaggerated anyway, right?
It will either turn out that the Forbidden Zone is indeed incredibly dangerous, or that there's no danger at all, and the heroes were supposed to keep out because it contains forbidden knowledge. Or both. In either case, the heroes will pass through more or less unscathed, and they may even figure out a way to make the zone less forbidden.
Compare Forbidden Fruit, Schmuck Bait. The dangerous kind of Forbidden Zone overlaps with Death World.
Not to be confused with Forbidden Zone, a Danny Elfman film."
t08369,ForegoneConclusion,"Most dramatic tension in story-telling comes from the audience being ignorant of the work's ending. Audience members invest in characters and plots and want to know how they are treated and resolved, respectively.
Sometimes, however, authors choose to go a different route. They will make known to the audience how their story ends before they even begin telling it. Sometimes they'll do so with an explicit statement (such as in a Spoiler Opening or How We Got Here), sometimes by writing a prequel that ends right where the original work begins. Whatever the case may be, the author has given himself quite a task. He must find some way to establish tension and doubt when everyone knows how the story is going to end.
This can be easily confused with several tropes. It Was His Sled deals with twists or endings that, thanks to their assimilation into popular culture, no longer surprise us although the author originally did not intend for everyone to know the ending. How We Got Here and In Medias Res are related, but not identical. And movies or shows which, by their predictable nature, indicate how the work ends don't count either: the audience already knows that the good guys will win, that Batman will survive to fight another day, same-bat-time-same-bat-channel, yes. But the ending isn't canonically established; theoretically, Adam West could die at the end of an episode, although realistically we know he won't.
Authors might cheat with this a bit (or a lot), either by having the ""ending"" shown be context-sensitive and open to an entirely different interpretation as the audience gets to know the set up, or with an outright Twist Ending by having the ""end"" shown in a How We Got Here like fashion be only the first 10 of 15 minutes, and ending much differently than is likely.
Or the whole thing isn't about what happens at the end, but how it happens. The Whodunnit becomes a Howdunnit, and so on.
Can also be used to crank Dramatic Irony Up to Eleven.
Historical Fiction is tied to this trope, since history ain't changing (unless the author pulls a Written by the Winners and claim that the events as portrayed in his work is what ""really"" happened).
Compare External Retcon, where the audience is expected to be familiar with an entire existing story.
Doomed by Canon is a subtrope of this, and deals with prequel characters and their attempts to either take out the main cast of the original story or survive to the end, attempts which we know are doomed because of the original story. Framing Device entails this to a certain extent, as any character alive to tell or hear the tale must have survived, and the setting may also hint.
In almost any story that has a narrator, you can safely assume the narrator will live. For similar reasons, in any Scrapbook Story, you can safely assume that somebody must have been able to put together the scrapbook. There are some deliberate subversions, of course, including ones where a ghost is narrating or scrapbooking.
Oh, and X Dies and Did You Die? are also subtropes.
This is Older Than Feudalism. Everyone who heard Homer sing already knew that Troy falls and Achilles and Hector both die; nobody walked out of Sophocles's play saying, ""Dude, he married his mom?"" There's a long, long tradition of retelling the story everyone knows.
Historical In-Joke is sometimes like this, but sometimes subverts it.
As a warning, this entry contains spoilers both marked and unmarked. Since several tropes can twist into a Subverted example, tread carefully."
t08393,Foreshadowing,"A clue or allusion embedded in the narrative that predicts some later event or revelation. It could be a wayward comment or action, an event that doesn't make sense until later, a Meaningful Name, a rare blood type... so many things can warn us of the future. The foreshadowing may be ominous, or mildly suggestive, or it could merely be obvious in hindsight.
Good foreshadowing doesn't spoil the surprise, yet seems an obvious clue in retrospect. Bad foreshadowing either deflates the suspense or is too obfuscated (such as an Ice-Cream Koan) to predict anything, and capable of being overused. Foreshadowing may establish something to avoid an Ass Pull. Or it may put a viewer off as introducing a needless supernatural element to the story.
In literature, foreshadowing is commonly done when a possibility is mentioned, but almost immediately dismissed or disproved. Some readers will dismiss the suggested possibility just as the unsuspecting characters do. More experienced readers will immediately call the author's bluff and know what to expect.
Dreaming of Things to Come often foreshadows. Chekhov's Gun is often used as a foreshadowing tool. If it makes no sense, it may be Strange Minds Think Alike. If this is done in a Prequel (such as in the page image), it's a Call-Forward.
Two specific variants are Futureshadowing, where the shadowing comes after the actual event chronologically but is still seen before it, and Foreseeing My Death, where a character has foreseen, prophesied or predicted his/her own demise.
When there's only a tiny gap between the foreshadowing and the actual foreshadowed event, that's Five-Second Foreshadowing.
Contrast Plot Point. Compare AND contrast ""Funny Aneurysm"" Moment (where what was meant as a joke now comes off as an unfortunate foreseeing of a real-life tragedy) and Hilarious in Hindsight (where something becomes funnier or more relevant due to appearing to be prescient to more recent events). Contrast Fauxshadow and Tempting Fate. Production Foreshadowing is this trope's meta version. This Index Will Be Important Later covers foreshadowing tropes. This trope is a good Rewatch Bonus.
Please do not misuse this trope to refer to a series installment having something that appears to reference franchise installments that couldn't have been planned until years after the fact. The more recent event is more likely to be an Internal Homage.
See also Trope Telegraphing.
Not to be confused with The Shadow Knows, which the picture to the right uses to do this trope.

t08502,FracturedFairyTale,"Once Upon a Time, there was a beautiful Damsel in Distress, a handsome prince on an epic quest, his magical sidekick, and a spell they needed to break before the stroke of midnight.
But wait! The damsel's not so distressed after all! The hero's a buffoon! The prince is charmless! The heroine falls for the homely comic relief sidekick instead of the Knight in Shining Armor! The Wicked Stepmother is an angel with a bratty stepdaughter! The sweet little girl in the red cloak is a Heroic Comedic Sociopath! And just about everyone's ridiculously Genre Savvy! And that's before you get to the ending, which may be pointedly different from the familiar version.
What you have here is an example of a Fractured Fairy Tale, a story with all the basic elements of a classic Fairy Tale, but all of them broken, rearranged and re-presented with modern-day sensibilities and morals. It may also be a parody of fairy tales, a Deconstruction of these tales' settings, morals and sensibilities, or a Perspective Flip (for instance, retelling it from the villain's point of view, often suggesting that the better-known version had an Unreliable Narrator). In all these instances, mundane aspects of the real world can pop up to further subvert tropes related to the genre.
Virtually every Fractured Fairy Tale features (at least) one of perhaps a dozen fairy tales that are considered common knowledge in the culture. This is because they don't work without the audience recognizing the original and so being able to appreciate the divergences. When the Fractured Fairy Tale sticks to, and warps, one specific tale, it is a form of the Twice-Told Tale. Combining stories into a Fairy Tale Free-for-All is also possible, though it, too, sticks mostly to the best known tales — perhaps even more so, since the characters have shorter periods to make their character known.
These are a lot more common than the naive observer would be led to believe. In fact, just about any myth or folktale presented to anyone over the age of 12 is bound to contain subversions of some sort, to the point that a completely non-ironic fairy tale itself feels like an irony.
It's somewhat common for these to overlap with Feminist Fantasy, satirizing the original story's gender politics. For instance, a popular twist is to have the brave princess rescue a knight in distress, or object to the idea of the suitor being awarded her hand in marriage. On the other hand, they've also frequently been used to satirize Political Correctness Gone Mad.
May contain elements of Grimmification. Nursery Rhyme elements and characters frequently also appear. Aesop's Fables are somewhat rarer but not unknown.
The Trope Namer comes from a Rocky and Bullwinkle segment of the same title and overall premise.
Compare and contrast Ironic Nursery Tune and Derailed Fairy Tale (when the listener or the teller takes the story Off the Rails). Subtrope of External Retcon. Super-Trope to Dystopian Oz."
t08511,FramingDevice,"""Man, do you remember that article we wrote about framing devices?"" ""That was a damn good article. How did it go again?"" ""Well, I believe it went something like this...""
The Framing Device is a narrative technique in which a story is surrounded (""framed"") by a secondary story, creating a story within a story, often through Separate Scene Storytelling. The inner story is usually the bulk of the work. The framing device places the inside story within a different context.
Framing devices typically involve outer-story characters as the audience of the inner story, such as a parent reading a bedtime story to a child. Other times, the outer-story character is the author of, or a performer in, the inner story. Occasionally, the inner story is a hallucination or delusion experienced by one of the outer-story characters.
The inner story does not need to be a work of fiction from an frame-story character's point of view: letters, journals, and memoirs can also be used as framing devices, often in the form of Day in the Life.
Anthologies and Clip Shows often use framing devices to connect the unrelated elements into a unified whole. The earlier ""Treehouse of Horror"" specials of The Simpsons use a framing device in this way, though the practice was eventually abandoned.
Occasionally, an entire series can use a persistent Framing Device, such as Cro, which was framed by a recently thawed mammoth, who was telling the stories which composed the bulk of each episode. A noteworthy example from the days of radio is Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar, whose stories were told in the form of explanations to a private detective's expense account. To a lesser extent, devices such as the Captain's Log can be viewed as a Framing Device, especially when (as in many Star Trek: The Original Series episodes) they appear to have been written after the fact.
The Framing Device is Older Than Dirt: It goes right back to the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt with the ""Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor"", c. 2300-2100 BC. Sometimes the trope is written using nested framing devices that are several layers deep, as in the Arabian Nights. Frankenstein is framed by a story of an arctic expedition coming across the dying Dr. Frankenstein; The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is framed by the mariner foisting his story on an unwilling wedding guest. One of the first (if not the first) examples in film is from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, which (on a suggestion from Fritz Lang) framed the original story as a flashback in an asylum.
The technique sometimes seems to be a byproduct of an ancient notion that it was improper to waste people's time with lengthy fabrications.
This is frequently used as a technique to highlight that the narrator of the framed story is not the actual author, and so draw attention to the possibility of an Unreliable Narrator.
See Whole Episode Flashback, Storybook Opening, How We Got Here, Interrogation Flashback and Nostalgic Narrator for more specific examples. When framing devices are stacked on top of each other, they create a Nested Story. If a framing device is set up and is later forgotten by the end of the story, it becomes a Forgotten Framing Device. If the existence of a framing device is used as a Plot Twist, we're dealing with a Nested Story Reveal. If the framing story is ""I came across this story and decided to publish it"", the author is invoking the Literary Agent Hypothesis. If done badly, you might find Expo Speak.

t08562,FreudianExcuse,"The writers have a villain, and they want to give that character some depth. The obvious solution is to Pet the Dog. Unfortunately, that tends to make the character less scary, causing Badass Decay and Villain Decay.
Instead, writers may keep the villain (especially The Sociopath) just as vile as before, but reveal that they have a reason for being that way. The most popular one is the Freudian Excuse: the villain had an abusive and particularly violent childhood (such as Abusive Parents, being bullied by peers, etc.), making them insane and warping their perception on the universe, and that's why they're sociopathic Serial Killers going on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge, or why they want to destroy everything out of their misery, or why they're Straw Nihilists who adhere to The Social Darwinist philosophy that it's a Crapsack World where Might Makes Right. Sometimes, this is done for deliberate Badass Decay, but usually it isn't. The villain is as horrible as ever, only now the audience can look at them in a new way.
Unfortunately, just like a Pet the Dog moment, the Freudian Excuse sometimes fails to give a villain any depth at all. If the villain is particularly evil, it can come across as an illogical and lame Non Sequitur: ""his father beat him, and that's why he's an Omnicidal Maniac."" Even if the villain's crimes are proportionate, the writers have to strike a hard balance. Too much emphasis on the excuse, and it looks like they're attorneys justifying the villain. Too little, and it is a fallacious Appeal to Pity that looks like a ridiculously gratuitous scene of Wangst. However, this can in turn be highlighted in-story if the other characters point out that Freudian Excuse Is No Excuse. In cases of Complete Monsters, it fails to justify anything, merely explaining their origins and nothing more. It could even be used to make the character worse, since they reject the possibility of ever getting over their trauma and changing their ways.
Most importantly, the Freudian Excuse does not involve the character growing or changing; it explains why they haven't changed, and in fact, often serves as a signal that they cannot and never will. Bad writers often think that the excuse can substitute for Character Development, but it does the exact opposite. Good writers know the excuse has limits, and watch them. If done shrewdly enough, it may lead the audience to Cry for the Devil. A Freudian Excuse is often invoked to explain how someone who Used to Be a Sweet Kid became such a monster instead - again, much writerly skill is generally needed to pull this off and make it poignant rather than pathetic.
The excuse can be played with in many ways. One way is to use it to show how pathetic a villain is — after the villain gives a Breaking Speech, a hero's classic rebuttal is ""says the guy who became a hit man to work out his daddy issues."" The second way is for the villain to sneer at the hero's pity for them, even exploiting it in a fight. (Further, the villain is protesting far too much.) A third way is to simply present it as an explanation rather than a full excuse. Sometimes the author simply shows what warped the character into what they became without expecting the audience to feel any more sympathetic toward the character- a sort of psychological How We Got Here. And a fourth way is to use the Freudian Excuse as a justification for a Heel–Face Turn; if the villain gets treatment he no longer has any reason to be evil and may pay the heroes back out of gratitude.
Many Crime and Punishment Series (and Darker and Edgier superhero comics) are notorious for Writer on Board stories deconstructing the Freudian Excuse. At least once per storyline, there will be a slimy psychiatrist or defense attorney who declares that the Neck-Chopping Killer is merely a victim of circumstances, and it's the hero who should be locked away. These stories tend to end with said psychiatrist or defense attorney getting murdered by the killer, which is depicted as poetic Irony.
However, not all examples of Freudian Excuses have to involve evil or villainous characters. It can also be used to explain the neurotic behaviors of even heroic or otherwise neutral characters.
See Freudian Excuse Is No Excuse for deconstructions of this trope. See also Dark and Troubled Past, Start of Darkness, Monster Sob Story, Jerkass Woobie, Abusive Parents, Parental Neglect, Parental Abandonment, ""Well Done, Son!"" Guy, Single-Issue Psychology, Tragic Bigot, Being Tortured Makes You Evil, Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds, You Are What You Hate, He Who Fights Monsters, and Who's Laughing Now?. Takes the ""It's Nurture"" position of the ""Nature vs. Nurture"" argument; for the Nature position, see In the Blood. Contrast Upbringing Makes the Hero.
Not to be confused with Freud Was Right, All Psychology Is Freudian (or any of the other five or so Tropes that Sigmund Freud was the Trope Namer for, actually.)
Please note that the trope deals only with traumatic experiences in childhood or adolescence. Being raped, losing one's job or family as a fully formed adult is not a Freudian Excuse."
t08611,FriendToAllLivingThings,"A character, often but not Always Female and The Hero(ine) of the piece, is shown to be almost supernaturally innocent, sweet, altruistic, or any combination thereof, by the way that all manner of wild forest creatures flock to her. Deer will shyly eat out of her hand, chipmunks will frolic at her feet, and birds will alight on her finger, shoulder or head (and not void their bowels while doing so). If the character is male (usually in reference to St. Francis of Assisi being the patron saint of animals) he will instead be shown as wise, calm and kind-hearted. Any other person approaching will break the spell and send the timid woodland animals fleeing, but not before they witness the supernatural wonder of his or her loving heart in action.
As for the animals, they will all be cute in most examples. This usually does not extend to Always Chaotic Evil species, and virtually never towards the Big Bad. Sometimes it does, though, developing some very interesting hero-villain interactions. Sometimes the heroine has such influence over the wild creatures that they will perform small tasks for her. In the case of gods or saints, flowers will spring up at their feet.
Some works acknowledge that the ability to befriend any living thing could be a LOT more impressive than it seems. It's easy to forget that the same princess whose singing summons an entire forest full of animals could, if she so chooses, send her animal friends to beat the tar out of you. Being Friend To All Living Things will sometimes also mean the person is a Fluffy Tamer, in which case they're even friends to snarling, terrifying living things.
This is often parodied. If the parody is clearly referencing the Disney Animated Canon examples, it falls under Disney Creatures of the Farce, and the examples should go there.
A frequent attribute of the All-Loving Hero and Princess Classic. Although a Common Mary Sue Trait it does not necessarily make a character such. With females, this may be related to the myth that only a virgin girl may approach a unicorn. While Friend to All Children sounds similar, it isn't necessarily the same thing—and, unlike this, is about just as likely to be a male trait as a female one.
A Sub-Trope of Nature Lover. A Sister Trope to Green Thumb, Fluffy Tamer (a friend to dangerous living things), Nature Hero (especially a female one) and Nature Loving Robot (When the character is a robot). Compare Cloud Cuckoo Lander, Licked by the Dog, and Good Taming, Evil Taming. Contrast Evil-Detecting Dog, Enemy to All Living Things, Not Good with People, Animals Hate Him, Cruella to Animals."
t08673,FunctionalMagic,"Magic that works. Maybe not exactly the way anyone wanted it to work, but it is not imaginary in the story and you may rely on it to do something. This style of phlebotinum is sometimes subject to magibabble, its own flavor of technobabble. Depending on the story, it may leave the Willing Suspension of Disbelief somewhat unstable.
Some flavors of Functional Magic:
In many settings, whatever sort of magic is present, not everyone can work it, or some people can work it much better than others — so any of the other types can overlap with Inherent Gift magic. If such a gift only works, or works much better, if the gifted individual is properly trained, that's Training the Gift of Magic.
While some magical systems allow it to do practically anything, restricted only by the user's power and imagination, in other systems the magic user is restricted to only one capability, one that fits a specific theme. Some classic themes are:
Related tropes: Whatevermancy is a common naming convention for fantasy magical styles. See Magic A Is Magic A. With all this wonderful diversity, you can expect some snobbish magicians to consider there are Unequal Rites. If practicing magic has a spiritual component, it may cross over with Enlightenment Superpowers. This Wiki has an article on writing Functional Magic systems.
See also Our Mages Are Different; this trope is Our Magic Is Different."
t08676,FunetikAksent,"A Funetik Aksent (Phonetic Accent) is dialogue spelled phonetically so that it looks the way the character sounds to someone with another accent. Since accents are one of the major ways of providing characterization, this is an easy shortcut to force the reader to act out the character correctly (admittedly at the cost of confusing those reading outside their language, and slowing those who aren't).
Though typically used now to highlight an exaggerated, clichéd and/or hammy character, this trope is famous for its somewhat bad-taste perpetuating of stereotypes in the past, portraying various cultures as less educated/intelligent/literate; a classic example is Gone with the Wind, where the black slaves' and poor whites' accents are given phonetically but the white owners' accent (which is every bit as thick) isn't.
Not all examples are bigoted, particularly if race or class-consciousness is a deliberate theme or issue in the work in question, such as George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion. Accents in real life are notoriously used to pigeonhole people, so reproducing a foreign or nonstandard accent may be a way of realistically or critically highlighting this social gap.
One of many subtropes under Accent Tropes and Language Tropes. Littering the text with apostrophes is optional. See also Speech Bubbles, for alternative ways of conveying information about the characters' voices, and Psmith Psyndrome, in which characters insist that someone else is using the wrong Funetik Aksent. And to read this article in a Funetik Aksent itself, see here.
To some more phonetic-savvy people, the accent might not be phonetic at all. ""Funetik"", using default phonetic rules, would be pronounced ""few-nitt-ick"".
Not to confuse with Xtreme Kool Letterz, which is about deliberately switching letters to make a word fancy.
The Other Wiki refers to Funetik Aksents as ""literary dialects""."
t08765,GaiasLament,"(Note: Empathic Music for an Empathic Environment!)
On a futuristic Earth, or similar location, plants, animals, and naturally clean water are things of the past. Something terrible has happened - civilization's negligence of the environment, a strange natural disaster, or even a combination of both - to turn the world into a wasteland. This isn't (usually) the Earth That Was, as the planet is still populated (usually overpopulated), but it's on its way there.
Real food is a luxury for only the rich while the general populace lives off of synthetic food, Food Pills, or a new kind of meat. Forests are gone, replaced by concrete and steel jungles, more commonly known as cities, which are dark and dirty. If there is any undeveloped land still left, it's a desert wasteland, spoiled beyond recovery. What was once coastline is now underwater. If the story takes place/has a scene in a coastal city, expect to see the tops of skyscrapers sticking out of the water. Sometimes this is reversed: seas become salt deserts, with the remains of beached ships scattered about. The problem of overpopulation may be solved with the legalization of suicide, or special clinics.
The general populace is detached from the natural world, having had no experience with it. However, if a character has the chance to see what is left of the green, or what the world once was, expect it to be a powerful moment. If the world is really far gone, they may simply see it as strange or alien.
A Sub-Trope of Dystopia and Crapsack World. Sister Trope to Just Before the End, Earth That Used to Be Better, and Green Aesop. ""Cousin"" Trope to After the End, as society is usually still hanging on, if barely, although it can go with it, (usually, this trope is either the reason why the world ended or whatever ended the world causes this trope). Frequently seen in Cyberpunk settings.
Compare to Gaia's Vengeance, when the world fights back. Extinct in the Future is a Sub-Trope that deals specifically with species that have gone extinct."
t08905,GenderBlenderName,"Most of the time, one can guess somebody's gender by reading their first name. Most first names have a well-defined gender, such as Alice or Robert.note In many countries you have to give a child at least one first name which makes clear the child's sex (since assigning a child male or female at birth is the only thing that matters for this).
...Well, most.
Sometimes the only name you get is an ambiguous abbreviation, such as Sam. Or a gender-neutral name, such as Dominique or Claude in French. Or worse, a name whose ""default gender"" changes from one country to another (or even over time in the same country!), like ""Andrea"" which is typically female in the U.S. and other Anglophone countries, in Spanish-speaking countries, and most European countries but typically male in Italy (in Greek it means ""manly""). And let's not forget the names that must be written down to determine the gender, such as Tony/Toni, Adrian/Adrienne or Francis/Frances.
Titles and initials can be misleading too, since many are assumed to be male. Expect Samus Is a Girl reaction when the actual gender of the title bearer is revealed. note This seems to be even worse in German as well: Most nouns are gender specific (A ""Polizist"" is a male police officer (""Polizisten"" is the plural form), a ""Polizistin"" is a female police officer (""Polizistinnen"" as a plural)) but when you don't clearly mean a woman or women (and sometimes even then) often the male form is used. e.g. A group of nine female and one male police officer would be referred to with the term that grammatically means many male police officers (""Polizisten"").
... And last, there are names which have no cultural ambiguity, but were chosen for the sole purpose of being the opposite gender. Usually played for laughs, but not always.
A frequent variation occurs when writers who skimped on research of a foreign culture's naming conventions inadvertently give a woman a masculine name or (less commonly) a man a feminine name. Russian characters are particularly vulnerable to this. (Confusingly, ""Sonya"" and ""Tanya"" are female names but ""Sasha"" and ""Valya"", being diminutives of Alexander/Alexandra and Valentin/Valentina respectively, are gender-neutral and ""Nikita"" is a male name, even though they all end with the same vowels — ""я"" (""ya"") being a separate letter from ""а"", which matches its Latin lookalike — which, in most Russian names and words, take the feminine grammatical gender.)
If a character is fated to become a permanent Wholesome Crossdresser or the victim of a Gender Bender accident they will typically have had names like this, because Fate is just funny like that.
Can sometimes be considered the Embarrassing First Name or the Embarrassing Middle Name.
Tomboyish Name is a Sub-Trope. Moustache de Plume is a similar trope, where a female author goes by a male pen name or uses an ambiguous form of her real name. Sobriquet Sex Switch is a related trope where someone's name is feminized/masculinized when they come out as trans, undergo genderbending, or crossdress."
t08911,GenderFlip,"Here's a quick spin on an old story: flip the male roles to the women and the female roles to the men. If you are in a hurry, you only need to change the casting, a few honorifics, pronouns, and maybe a first name or two. If you are able to give it a little more thought, though, you can take this opportunity to explore how there might be a difference in the way things play out with the genders reversed. It's a very old technique of retelling a story; many folk Fairy Tales have Gender Flip variants.
Sometimes the remake or reimagining of a work may involve Gender Flips due to societal changes on the Sliding Scale of Gender Inequality that, for example, would allow a formerly-male Number Two to be an Action Girl instead. Occasionally, the Gender Flip occurs with a work that's already in development, or even in production (due to, for example, an actor's sudden unavailability or simply a last-minute casting idea.) The results can be particularly interesting in these cases, as the written role may be almost completely unchanged from its original opposite-gender version.
Fanfics that use this trope are fairly common. Rule 63 is closely related, but executed differently. A good general rule of thumb is that a Rule 63 character looks like exactly the same character, as if subjected to Gender Bender. Gender Flip characters will often differ from their originals in a great many ways other than the character's sex.
Supertrope of She's a Man in Japan, which is specifically about localizations changing a character's gender. Distinguished from Crosscast Role, in which the actor is the opposite sex of the character. For example, a production of Hamlet that (as in Shakespeare's own day) had Ophelia played by a boy would be a Crosscast Role, but a production with a male actor playing a male character named ""Ophelius"" and referred to in the text with male pronouns would be a Gender Flip.
Not to be confused with Gender Bender, though the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.note On this wiki, Gender Bender is when a character's sex is changed In-Universe through Applied Phlebotinum or the like. A Gender Flip is when a character's sex is changed through an adaptation, e.g. if a character is a dude in the book but is made female in the movie. When a song gets this treatment in a Cover Version, that's The Cover Changes the Gender.
Also note that this trope is not about ""gender roles"" in the generic sense. Those are covered (for examples involving couples, anyway) by Masculine Girl, Feminine Boy. See also Distaff Counterpart and Historical Gender Flip. See also Race Lift when it's the ethnicity that changes."
t08931,GenerationXerox,"Yes, we know Lamarck Was Right. But this is getting silly.
You see, not only has our hero discovered his Secret Legacy and realized that, due to his Superpowerful Genetics, he has inherited all of Mom and Dad's abilities (including the ones courtesy of Charles Atlas)... he's found out that he's destined/doomed to live out a replay of their lives.
This trope takes ""following in your parent's footsteps"" to a whole new level. The character hasn't just inherited their parents' character traits and superpowers — they've inherited their entire life story.
They will meet the same people their parents met, or, if this isn't possible, they will have an equivalent. If Mandy's best friend when she was a child was Polly the Soap Box Sadie, her daughter Mindy will befriend Paula the Soap Box Sadie on her first day of school. Sometimes it's just a coincidence, where the child seems to gravitate towards the same type of people as their mom and dad were drawn to, but often the new associate will have some direct tie to the parent's past (e.g. is the daughter of someone that knew the character's mom).
Often, certain key events will happen exactly as they did in the past. Turn Out Like His Father is most likely to fail when crossed with this trope. In many plotlines, however, the outcome will change at the last moment since the hero(ine) has heard the story from their parents and has had the time to work out what went wrong and worked up the guts to change it. For example, if the hero's dad fell out with his best friend because neither would apologize to the other, the hero will figure out that saying sorry is the best way to keep his own friendship going.
To a certain point, this trope can be a Justified Trope. If the parents send the kid to the same school as they themselves went to, then it's not such a stretch to believe that the son or daughter will encounter the same people. If the parents kept in touch with their old friends, it's not unlikely that the child will befriend the children of those friends. However, if the parents moved to a different country, assumed secret identities and tried to forget the past, only to have Junior come home from his first day of school announcing that his dad's right-hand man is his English teacher... that's a bit more of a stretch.
Mentors who become parental figures will also tend to pass on their life story, although karma rather than genetics will be held responsible for the resulting deja vu.
Love Interests and relationships tend to get copied whole cloth as well, whether it's the descendants of two Star-Crossed Lovers or the child of the Official Couple from a Love Dodecahedron finding out they have their parent's stable's children gunning for them with Cupid's arrows.
And heaven help you if your parents/mentors made a mess of their lives because guess what? Yup, that Fatal Flaw was hereditary too. Better get to work figuring out just how they screwed things up because if you don't, chances are the same tragedy's going to happen again. And it'll be your fault this time around, in which case you'll have no choice but to pass the entire scenario on to your son or daughter and hope that they can Set Right What Once Went Wrong — a kind of generational ""Groundhog Day"" Loop.
See also In the Blood, Secret Legacy, Superpowerful Genetics, Legacy Character. Often this leads to Parental Hypocrisy. Opposed Mentors will have opposed students who will become mentors themselves etc.
When it's only the appearance that's the same between generations, usually by using the exact same actors to portray both ancestors and descendants, you have an Identical Grandson."
t08954,GeniusLoci,"Some people are places. A Genius Loci is a location with a mind. A sentient planet, country, island, city, or street. Obviously, this is more common in science fiction and fantasy, though a certain amount of animism in otherwise realistic series isn't unknown, and it may be only suggested.
Usually, the Genius Loci has some control over its own form, and uses that control to communicate with the other characters. Alternately, it can trap them in Alien Geometries and torment them with Living Memories for shoots and giggles. It can be a Hive Mind formed from the various organic life-forms that inhabit a place, a nonphysical being possessing the area itself, a mythological spirit of a locale, or a computer system laced through the brick and stone. It can be helpful, neutral, or antagonistic.
The name comes from the Latin for ""spirit of a place"", originally a location's protective guardian spirit. To refer to ""spirits of places"", or multiple locations, each with their own guardian spirit, the correct pluralization is Genii Locorum. For ""spirits of a place"", or a place inhabited by a Mind Hive, the correct term is Genii Loci. And for a ""spirit of places"", such as an omnipresent being inhabiting many disconnected lands, the term is Genius Locorum.
The Other Wiki has more details on Genii Locorum here.
See Setting as a Character for when the location isn't actually alive, but is still treated as a character in the work.
Contrast with the non-tangible but often similar Sentient Cosmic Force. Compare Sapient House, Sapient Ship, That's No Moon!, Anthropomorphic Personification, The Lost Woods, Fisher King, Fisher Kingdom, Living Structure Monster, Smart House, A Dungeon Is You and Giant Corpse World. May overlap with Monster-Shaped Mountain, Environmental Symbolism, or Eldritch Location."
t08973,GenreSavvy,"A Genre Savvy character doesn't necessarily know they're in a story, but they do know of stories like their own and what worked in them and what didn't. They may attempt to apply the lessons they've learned from movies, books, or other fiction to their own situation, or they may restrict themselves to snarky asides and observations. The exact opposite of Genre Blindness.
For cases when a Genre Savvy character attempts to apply the tropes of a different genre of story to their own situation, see Wrong Genre Savvy. When a person becomes too Genre Savvy for their own good and offs themselves, see Death by Genre Savviness. If a character uses his Genre Savviness just to make humorous observations, he's a Meta Guy. When characters are not consciously Genre Savvy but regularly act within the limitations of the genre they're in anyway, they are Functional Genre Savvy. If a character acts like a Genre Blind person due to their Genre Savviness, this is Contractual Genre Blindness. Compare with Medium Awareness where the character knows that they're in a story and what medium they are in. May result in You Watch Too Much X.
Not to be confused with a character who has observed what works and what doesn't in their own world, which is Taught by Experience.
For specific tips on surviving the world of fiction, see The Universal Genre Savvy Guide."
t08978,GentleGiant,"He's big, muscular and angry looking. He might even be an actual monster. People are often fearful of him. But he's got a heart of gold. He loves children and puppies, and frequently abhors unnecessary violence. He is often rather intelligent, level-headed and analytical, a voice of reason in the group. He probably has a few unexpected hobbies. He's the Gentle Giant. However, when push comes to shove, he's great to have on your side in battle.
This is a Violation of Common Sense that has become an archetype in its own right. We are all used to thinking of big people and giant creatures as frightening and mean. Starting back as far as Frankenstein's Monster or earlier, the seven-foot shambling hulk of a man is almost always gentle inside, and misunderstood by society at large.
This archetype is so common it's probably more surprising for the musclebound hulk to turn out to be an irreconcilable jerk or bloodthirsty killer. The old subversion has become the new norm.
Two out of three examples of The Big Guy from the Five-Man Band are likely to be this type; he is their Class 2. (The other is usually a Genius Bruiser.) Sometimes has a much smaller friend and companion.
The typical Gentle Giant is quiet and, while not ""book smart"" (and sometimes outright stupid), is usually closer to Earth. An occasional subversion of this is to make him the most intelligent member of the group, either as a scientist and tech guy or as a cynic. He may also like things that other guys will think of as ""un-manly"", and woe to whomever mocks him for that.
Just don't push him too far. He will push back.
Compare The Grotesque. Contrast The Napoleon and Killer Rabbit. See also Bruiser with a Soft Center, for which being tough and badass is the default, and the sensitivity may be a Hidden Depth. Frequently overlaps with Face of a Thug. Not to be confused with the British progressive rock band."
t09016,GettingCrapPastTheRadar,"Getting Crap Past the Radar refers to instances in which a writer, artist or other creator puts inappropriate content — stuff that blatantly violates the censorship standards that are normally applied to that kind of work — into their material with the deliberate intent to get past said censorship.
How this is accomplished may vary. The content submitted for ratings may be so offensive that the demands to cut it down end up missing things that would have otherwise been obvious (AKA the Censor Decoy). The creators may hide offensive content as Easter Eggs. Sometimes the Media Watchdogs are just asleep at the wheel. Such events can result in bad (or good) press for a work, angry calls to a network or studio, or an Internet Backdraft.
It is important to distinguish this trope from other tropes like Parental Bonus, Subtext, and Accidental Innuendo. In these cases, younger audience members are expected to miss the messages, but adults will read them loud and clear. Censors are usually fine with such things, so it's not a violation of media standards. Indeed, this is often a deliberate and widely accepted ploy to engage older audiences in what is nominally a family-friendly work, and such it is not Getting Crap Past the Radar.
Contrast with Defying the Censors, in which the creators fight to have their controversial work shown to the masses. See also Crosses the Line Twice, which can be the end result of gradually increasing the level of inappropriate content.
Important note for editors: To qualify for this trope, content must meet three criteria:
Please note that U.S. censorship standards allow minor incidents of profanity and innuendo in PG works."
t09074,GiftedlyBad,"Giftedly Bad refers to someone, typically an artist, who plies his trade with intense passion, infinite drive, supreme self-confidence, and absolutely no talent whatsoever. If they are actors, they're melodramatic hams; if they are singers, they warble and screech; if they are poets, they're masters of the Painful Rhyme. In general, their work will have what one person associated with the Museum of Bad Art (an exhibition of this trope in visual media) has called the ""Oh my God factor"" (as in, Oh my God, what do they think they're doing?)
What makes someone giftedly bad is not just their extreme lack of talent, but two other factors. First, the subject must be absolutely convinced that they're the best there is at what they do. And second, pretty much every other person must believe that they're as terrible as they really are (although they might not admit it to them to spare their feelings).
A giftedly bad artist often sees some level of severe Critical Backlash; he treats this criticism with Selective Obliviousness and continues working undeterred, believing all his critics to be wrong and misguided. He'll occasionally throw out a Take That, Critics! and tell them he'll be Vindicated by History. It's not all bad, though; a giftedly bad artist could also be considered So Bad, It's Good, and thus become as celebrated and revered as a genuinely talented artist, but only out of the kick people get out of seeing an earnest and enthusiastic artist producing utter crap.
So Unfunny, It's Funny is a Sub-Trope. So Bad, It's Good is often a by-product, but not a necessary condition; while an artist whose entire oeuvre is So Bad, It's Good is almost always Giftedly Bad, the reverse isn't necessarily true, and no giftedly bad artist is trying to be So Bad, It's Good.
It's also a surprisingly common trope in Real Life, thanks to the Dunning-Kruger effect, which states that the skills necessary for being good at something are also necessary for assessing one's talent at something. This means that someone who's really untalented doesn't know enough to know how untalented he is, and he thus believes himself to be better than he really is.
Related tropes include High Hopes, Zero Talent (the artist is aware of how bad he is but keeps trying nonetheless); Small Name, Big Ego (who overestimates himself in every other aspect of his life); Muse Abuse (where an artist exploits people in his real life for inspiration); Bungling Inventor and Terrible Artist (natch); and Bile Fascination (explaining why people are so interested in the Giftedly Bad).
Finally, please remember the above criteria when adding examples:"
t09177,GloryDays,"You have a Crowning Moment of Awesome in your past. It haunts you. Either your life went downhill, or you continually fail to match or top that moment, or you try coasting on that glory for the rest of your life.
One of the classic examples is the stereotypical high school jock who won the big game, and spends the rest of his life in an unsatisfying job. Either he didn't make it in college, or he's treated as a rank-and-file Office Drone in the business world. Later he may inform his miserable children that these are the Best Years of Your Life.
Compare I Coulda Been a Contender!, Nostalgia Filter (when a character looks back on the past with rose-tinted glasses), Tough Act to Follow, White-Dwarf Starlet, Jaded Washout (spends his time wishing he was still back there), Loser Protagonist, and Trade Your Passion for Glory.
When a character had to leave a dangerous life for a more mundane one, and spends it longing for his glory days, he is in love with being In Harm's Way. If the character is using her children as a vector through which to either achieve what she never did or relive her glory days (instead of letting the kids be who they are), she may become an Education Mama or a Stage Mom. See also Jock Dad, Nerd Son.
Contrast While You Were in Diapers."
t09234,GodSaveUsFromTheQueen,"The Good Kingdom: A lovely, wealthy country ruled by a benevolent king, a wise prince, and a fair princess loved by the populace. But what's that? There's a queen? Oh, brother, we're in trouble.
While kings and princes can be good or evil, and nice or mean, and princesses are (almost) always good, queens tend to be the royalty version of Always Chaotic Evil. Restrained by a competent king (or in a setting where the queen's only role is to produce an heir to the throne), this usually doesn't show, but once a queen is in charge, things get nasty. Either the king is missing or died in an accident — the queen might have helped things along herself—or he's easily manipulated for some reason. Note that there are good queens in fiction, but they normally don't stay around for very long, or at all. And this trope comes into play whether they are ruling in their own right or as regents for the under-age king. (The latter group tends to fall under My Beloved Smother, as well.)
Averted pretty much every time the lovely princess becomes queen mid or end-story, or when the queen was a princess in a prequel to the story, and when the princess rules the kingdom much like a queen would, and is only princess in title. Good queens don't need to be listed: they are simply The High Queen.
There is a notable difference in how queens are portrayed depending on how they came to be queen. Queens who became queen because their late father the king had no sons are usually exempt from this trope, by virtue of being the ""rightful heir"". Her sexist adversaries may view her like this, but the narration will usually be on her side, in the style of You Go, Girl! Meanwhile, queens who become queens by marrying kings and/or getting their sons on the throne are very likely to fall under this trope. Why? Because Ambition Is Evil. Also, she likely became queen by marrying a king as a Hot Consort, and seductresses are evil—and she is probably suspected of being a Lady Macbeth.
If the evil queen is in charge of a Hive Mind, she is by definition a Hive Queen. Also overlaps with Matriarchy (particularly the Straw Matriarchy) and sometimes Evil Matriarch. In terms of the ranks of Authority Tropes, the tropes that are equal are The High Queen (her Sister Trope and Good Counterpart), The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask, She Is the King, The Good King, and President Evil. The next step up is The Emperor. Also compare The Caligula."
t09270,GoldDigger,"This is a character who hooks up with a rich partner (known as a Meal Ticket or Sugar Daddy), specifically to mooch off of said partner's money and status (usually in exchange for sex).
We use ""she"" because the digger is usually (but not always) female in modern shows, and often MUCH more attractive than her partner. The idea that all women are gold diggers is the other Distaff Counterpart (next to All Women Are Lustful) to the idea that All Men Are Perverts. This may also overlap with All Women Are Prudes, resulting in the idea that the only reason women ever have sex is to gain access to a man's money and/or get men to buy them things, while the only reason men even bother to make money in the first place is so that they can have sex with lots of hot women.
Often Distracted by the Luxury quite easily. Generally stunningly beautiful, to explain her success. Often a blonde whose hair is dyed. The gold digger who is deluding herself about her looks is a rarity.
Once able to spend his money, she will be conspicuous about it. Expect lots of evening dresses (pimped out if older works, and simple ones in recent works), jewelry by the truckload, and at least a few furs. She may already have the Cool Car and Big Fancy House her husband owns, but may buy her own of the former, and insist on redecorating the latter.
Many a gold digger would be happy to marry a man who is old or in bad health, just so long as he'd be so kind as to leave at least some of his inheritance to his spouse when he dies; most aren't malignant enough to help that process along, but those who are willing to do so enter Black Widow territory.
A common subversion is to have her turn out to be a Hooker with a Heart of Gold after all. Another way that works play with this is to have a rich man pretending to be poor, so as to ensure that any woman he becomes involved with loves him for himself and not his money. Yet another way to play with it is to have her genuinely fall in love with her meal ticket.
When it comes to interacting with people other than their Meal Ticket, gold diggers are often extremely self-centered, vain, manipulative and bitchy Socialites with no other goal in their life than pampering themselves and buying whichever catches their fancy.
Also common are women who go after young members of the armed forces, and the United States stereotype of the ""dependapotamus"" outlines this best: a woman in her late teens or very early twenties who lurks around the base or near wherever young soldiers typically congregate, who hooks the first naive young boy who grew up in some podunk backwater locale, gets married to him extremely fast (usually within months), and then does the absolute bare minimum while leeching off of him and his military benefits, and probably cheats on him whenever they're deployed as well.
Historically, this used to be the rule for both parties; back then the now-rare male ""fortune hunters"" were much more common (stereotypically, they would woo young heiresses without parental protection or older women with money but no looks). This was particularly common in Victorian Britain, as economic changes forced many Peers to face that their old way of life had become unsupportable (particularly their country estates). Their primary source of income since the Middle Ages had been agriculture, but the main crop (grain) could be far more cheaply grown in the United States, Canada, Russia, and (later) Australia where land was abundant, and with steamships it could also be imported so cheaply the importers could undersell the aristocrats even though they were bringing the stuff from the far side of the world. The economics were fairly similar regarding livestock (a possible alternative to selling grain), with the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina often being able to undersell domestic British producers of beef, mutton, and pork, especially after the invention of refrigerated ships around the 1880s meant that the meat could be transported ""on the hook"" (i.e. as already slaughtered fresh meat) rather than ""on the hoof"" (i.e. as living animals) or as cured meatnote Live animals need to be fed and cared for while on ship. Dead meat does not eat (or poop). (though this wasn't as consistent; some British producers could keep up with the New World).
The aristocrats initially tried to ""fix"" their problem with protectionism, but this failed. Since that left only dairy and fruit-and-vegetable production as viable agricultural alternatives, and the British market could only absorb so much butter (which Ireland was better for producing anyway) and jam, many young British nobles married the daughters of self-made industrialists and merchants (who had previously been seen as too low-class for the upper crust to marry), particularly American ones.For instance Lord Randolph Churchill marrying Jennie Jerome, the daughter of a New York banker—their name should sound familiar, as they're Winston's parents. The Other Wiki even has a list. By the 20th century the male gold diggers almost disappeared (except for more villainous roles), and middle-class women were now getting married to richer men, establishing the current image of this trope. A modern variant known as ""FinDom"", or Financial Domination, couples this trope with BDSM, where the wealthier partner acts as the submissive, and is decidedly more up-front about it.
Another male variant exists in the Japanese Visual Kei subculture: Visual Kei artists, especially lifestylers or current or ex-Delinquents, are almost unemployable outside of their own industry in a culture dependent on conformity as a requisite of traditional employment. As a result, quite a few indies, beginning, or unsuccessful artists will work in a Host Club and/or seek out a mitsukano or mitsukare (""honey woman"" or ""honey man"") to provide for them on a financial level.
This is Older Than Steam. Subtrope of Sleeping Their Way to the Top. Compare Rich Suitor, Poor Suitor. See also Trophy Wife, although the two don't always overlap. Sometimes overlaps with Coattail-Riding Relative. There's also a degree of overlap with The Schlub Pub Seduction Deduction, when an unattractive guy is unable to figure out that the hot woman is only coming on to him for ulterior motives. The cardinal sin of the Gold Digger, to no one's surprise, is Greed, though Lust and Gluttony (of the materialistic variety) also figure in.
For the opposite type of character, who definitely does not want the rich beau's money, see Not with Them for the Money. Contrast Marry for Love.
Important Note: A gold digger is almost never a Housewife. While both of them stay home, the gold digger has expensive tastes and refuses to dirty her hands. Children and family are almost never part of her priorities, mostly because they would distract her from her life of luxury; though a divorcing gold digger will use the kids as bargaining chips to gain as much money as possible (often seeking to be the custodial parent) without regard for the children's best interests and often without any real affection for the children. Some smarter gold diggers will be, or learn to be, housewives to give extra incentive for their husband/sugar daddy to keep them around. The Housewife on the other hand, even though she may live off her husband's paycheck, will concern herself with running the home and raising the kids, money and luxury usually not being in her repertoire other than as byproducts. A gold digger MIGHT turn into a housewife given proper character development.
For the comic book series, see Gold Digger. For the people who make a living actually digging up gold, see Prospector."
t09328,GoodIsNotNice,"Affably Evil is when a villain is polite, friendly and genuinely kind, even while plotting evil. Good Is Not Nice is the inverse of that: characters who are morally slanted toward the good side but are rude, unfriendly, and mean.
They never kill anyone if they can help it, nor would they allow people to come to any sort of harm by ignoring them. They are always willing to go out of their ways to save the town and complete strangers. When the call comes, they will answer it, usually with little protest. They often help people in need with little promise of reward. In almost every way, they act like ideal heroes.
Except that they are asocial and sometimes downright abusive toward most people they meet. They may refuse to explain anything. They may also actively rebuke people who express gratitude, friendship, love, and/or offers of support when they are faced with problems.
There are a few reasons these people may act like this:
Note that when handled well, this can create an interesting, complex character. When done poorly, you can end up with serious Moral Dissonance, a Designated Hero and/or even an Unintentionally Unsympathetic character.
Compare Noble Demon, who will likely fall into this if not too morally ambiguous. Often a Knight In Sour Armor, Mr. Vice Guy, Jerk with a Heart of Gold, Jerkass Woobie, or sometimes just a Jerkass who does good things. The term Anti-Hero is sometimes used to cover this trope. Sister trope to Creepy Good. Naive newcomers may be surprised to learn they are not the idealized hero everyone thinks they are. The hero's meanness will result with him becoming a Hero with Bad Publicity.
Why Light powers can be the Holy Hand Grenade even when Light Is Good.
Lawful Good versions of this trope may be strict, humorless and serious. In other cases, they will put more emphasis on ""Lawful"" than ""Good"". Very common personality flaw for The Paladin. Chaotic Good versions will often see politeness and good manners as useless rules and are only concerned about doing good.
See also Hidden Depths. Also see the Knight Templar, who goes beyond merely not being ""nice"" into darker territory.
Contrast Good Is Not Dumb. May overlap with Good Is Not Soft, but the key difference is that a character can be nice but ruthless, which makes them Good Is Not Soft, or they can be mean but not necessarily ruthless, making them this trope.
See also Affably Evil, a trope that could be called ""Evil Is Not Mean."" Contrast both with Faux Affably Evil, for when the villain is a far bigger asshole than any hero under this trope while acting nice.
For your convenience, here are tropes which focus on the types of good guys who aren't nice as well as actions that demonstrate it:"
t09352,GoodScarsEvilScars,"You can easily tell heroes from villains by their scars.
Good guys tend to scar in an attractive, fashionable manner — usually a single neat pale line, flush with the skin and placed in one of the following strategic locations: straight across one cheek, straight down from beneath the eye (popular with tough and/or grizzled characters), or straight up from the eyebrow. A scar extending up or down from the lip can happen, but it's rare as it can give a harelipped look more associated with shifty characters (and a similar scar on the other side of the lip is right out). A scar straight over the bridge of the nose has the interesting effect of looking cute and warlike at the same time. They can also have a big, raised scar or a burn, but only if it's in a place where the character has to be shirtless for you to see it. Perhaps the ultimately cliché ""good guy"" scar is two scars forming an X across the cheek or forehead.
Bad guys can also have fashionable scars to go show off their being evil, which blurs the playing field a bit; more often than not they have big raised slashes (often running up the face, stopping just below the eye, then continuing from the eyebrow up) and mottled, discolored burns. They are not limited to one but may have two or three scars, or be Covered with Scars; they may have a Red Right Hand in the form of a missing eye or ear, missing teeth, or a large chunk out of the nose or chin. Anything they're missing might have an Artificial Limb as a substitute, and in fact they might be so horribly scarred that they generally wear a mask over everything.
The Anti-Hero can go either way. Anti heroes sometimes tend to have a scar starting from below the eye and ending above it while the eye itself is usually intact.
This trope can be easily averted or subverted however, given that a disfiguring scar can be used to show that they've had a hard or even tragic life, or to mark an influential moment in their past.
Doesn't do well for the 'external beauty is meaningless' school of thought; it's more like Beauty = Goodness with respect to the relative sexiness/scariness of scars.
If the scarred person has a Love Interest (and the work is sufficiently idealistic) expect said Love Interest to talk at least once about how they don't care about their loved one's scars.
Compare Good Hair, Evil Hair, Knuckle Tattoos. See also Scars Are Forever, Mark of Shame.
NOT Truth in Television, as how an individual scars is the result of age, genetics, and how the wound is cared for, while artificial limbs are much more likely to be the result of a transportation accident than evil deed."
t09447,GrandTheftMe,"When one character forcibly and deliberately swaps bodies with another.
There are two main versions of this:
Except when stealing a body for its super-powers, the perpetrator seldom cares much about the victim, choosing whoever seems young, strong, attractive, and convenient. Often this is The Hero, and it sets up an episode plot. Sometimes, the perpetrator holds a competition to find the strongest in the land, with this as its hidden grand-prize. Other times, the target is the perpetrator's own offspring, who may or may not willingly volunteer; this is especially heinous if the offspring was a sympathetic character.
Grand Theft Me almost always involves stealing the victim's identity as well; with the second type, in fact, that's the whole point. A common strategy is to name the patsy as one's heir, then do the swap and kill the old body off. If done this way you often have overlap with Familial Body Snatcher and Raised as a Host. Alternatively, the old body can be committed to a mental hospital, since no one will believe the ranting of an old man who thinks he's a twenty-year-old. If the replaced person is a main character, this often sets off a Spot the Imposter plot.
Oftentimes, this is conducted in secret, and the villain reveals his true identity after a whole story spent as someone else. Especially disconcerting if his new body is the Girl of the Week. (See Showing Off the New Body.)
A more modern version is the idea of raising a clone for the purpose of brain transplant (or, more realistically, replacement parts); whatever happens to the original body after the swap is irrelevant.
A subtrope of Body Snatcher, and the dark cousin of ""Freaky Friday"" Flip. Sometimes, a villain attempting this type of swap can start a ""Freaky Friday"" Flip plot, or both could occur in parallel, as the required phlebotinum is the same. If it's not a human doing the possessing, it's Demonic Possession. If it's done by multiple beings at the same time, it's Many Spirits Inside of One. If a character is capable of doing this several times in a row, it's Body Surf. Compare Heart Drive. Contrast Fusion Dance, where it's usually done willingly and/or having them have equal control of the one body they're in.
Certain characters can break this, partially or completely, if the thief tries to go against an Intrinsic Vow.
It was first featured in modern fiction in the H. G. Wells story ""The Story of the Late Mr. Elvesham"".
Has nothing to do with playing Grand Theft Auto with yourself, and the title of the trope is more of a call-out to the actual crime.
Major spoilers ahead!"
t09527,GreenEyedMonster,"Envy and jealousy are among the most powerful motivations in both fiction and Real Life. The Bible condemns it in many places, most famously in the Ten Commandments, and it's also one of the Seven Deadly Sins.
Envy is the desire for some object, item or abstract notion (such as love or power), which can lead to hatred of the possessor(s) of said object. If they cannot secure the object for themselves, the envious party may go so far as to harm or… eliminate the possessor. If they're egocentric enough, they may even destroy/kill the object. The Envious party may not have coveted the object at all until they saw another person having or enjoying it.
Similar to but distinct from envy is jealousy, which applies much more to relationships. Jealousy is the fear by the possessing party of losing the object. For those in a relationship, this means fear of being supplanted in the object's heart by someone (or even something else). To be precise, envy is the desire for something one does not have whereas jealousy is the fear of losing that something. Both result in similar behaviour.
Envious and jealous characters on the losing side of a Love Triangle will often fall into the trap of assuming things about their competitor—or ""competitor"". Such characters are seldom portrayed positively—most are villains—and as such they tend to assume some rather bad things about their rivals. Expect to see some element of What Does She See in Him? on their parts. Furthermore, they may slander their rivals with accusations of unsavoury actions and/or attribute base motives (such as pride) to their actions. Whether they actually believe there is a fundamental truth to such slander—or have even been manipulated by a third party—plays a big part in determining audience sympathy for them.
This is the motivation behind the bad kind of Dead Person Impersonation. A character may attempt to exploit this with Operation: Jealousy. See also You're Just Jealous. Feet of Clay or Shrouded in Myth may prove that the envy was unmerited—often to the glee of the envious. On the other hand, a story about the Lonely Rich Kid or some other Sour Grapes Tropes may demonstrate that the envy is wrong because the envied person really suffers more than the person doing the envy (and not because it's wrong to hate people for what they have).
Romantically, may stem from being Love Hungry and lead to a desire to Murder the Hypotenuse—or be sacrificed because I Want My Beloved to Be Happy. Occasionally, it can actually overcome Cannot Spit It Out—Operation: Jealousy may overtly attempt to engineer this—or lead to a Love Epiphany. A man driven by it will often unreasonably doubt whether a child really is his.
Because the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, frequently two characters envy each other, as when an ordinary child envies the gifted child's abilities and rewards, and the gifted child envies the ordinary child's freedom from pressure.
When a character acts upon their envy, then we have the trope Driven by Envy. The Lancer (among heroes) and The Starscream (among villains) are particularly prone to the Green-Eyed Monster. The Dark Magical Girl often envies the Magical Girl. Inspiring envy is a defining trait of The Minnesota Fats, and feeling it, of Clingy Jealous Girl, Crazy Jealous Guy, the Fairest of Them All, and The Resenter. The Yandere is defined by it. The Daddy's Girl, inspired by it, may regard any possible stepmother as a Wicked Stepmother, even if she's truly the sweetest person in the world. Divided We Fall is often motivated by it.
One of Mary Sue's more noticeable traits is that many characters do not suffer from the Green-Eyed Monster about her, regardless of how plausible it is that they would not envy her gifts or be jealous of her romantic success. Either that, or the Mary Sue (especially the of Sympathetic Sue kind) will suffer horrific, mean-spirited attacks inspired by the Green-Eyed Monster, especially if it's from the character who poses the biggest threat to her and her beau's True Love.
Oddly enough, not correlated with characters who have green eyes, or with monsters. Not related to the 37-foot high left field wall at Fenway Park in Boston, unless you're envious of someone else having a ballpark with something cool like that."
t09561,GroinAttack,"It's not always played for comedy, but seeing someone get struck in the crotch is usually just plain funny. Whether the object doing the striking is an errant piece of sports equipment or a deliberately placed foot, the end result is going to be a grown man doubled over and trembling with pain. Bonus points if he then hobbles away and says something in a high-pitched voice. Not only will everyone find this hilarious, but tape it and play it back for the guy and even he will probably laugh. At least, once the swelling goes down. Sometimes a cause of Amusing Injuries, especially if the victim is asking for it. In shows targeted at children, it's often a Dangerous Forbidden Technique, or at least treated as one in-story (see 3 Ninjas and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie). In Japanese media, the blow is often accompanied by the sound of a bell.
Effectively, this is a human's version of Attack Its Weak Point for massive damage. A subversion of this is Balls of Steel, where a character — for whatever reason — does not take damage from a Groin Attack (or at least doesn't take extra damage).
For some reason, this usually only applies to men. Female characters are rarely subjected to groin attacks of any kind, and when they are they are also likely to just shrug off in a moment.note While the female genitals are better protected than their male counterparts, the female groin area itself is full of nerve endings and sensitive skin tissue that when hit, while maybe not as painful as it would be on a man, will still be quite debilitating. Female genitals also lack the squish factor that comes from swinging in the wind. On the symbolic level, a groin attack on a male — especially if it's delivered by a female — represents that male being brought low by the very source of his masculine pride.
In contrast to most groin attacks, groin attacks that draw blood or involve some form of mutilation are very likely not to be played for comedy — and owing to the Primal Fear of bad things happening to our nether regions, particularly nasty attacks of this nature can be downright disturbing. Apart from being a hallmark of the Lust variant of the Serial Killer, this form of attack is most often used as either a particularly vicious form of Cold-Blooded Torture or as a way for Antiheroes to punish rapists and other sexual criminals, though a particularly vicious Combat Pragmatist may also use this tactic as just one more way to even the score or gain the upper hand in a fight. It may still come off as funny, though, if the guy is perceived as having brought it upon himself, such as having his gun go off in his pants. See Crippling Castration for examples of groin attacks that lead to the unfortunate victim losing his organs/the ability to procreate.
Along with Taser Tag Weakness, the Groin Attack also seems to be very effective against Superheroes and Supervillains, although some of them are immune.
Compare Freudian Threat. Also see Standard Female Grab Area (which is not the same area, instead the upper arm). Eye Scream, Fingore, and The Tooth Hurts are other primal fear reactions. The Distaff Counterpart to this trope is Breast Attack. Often utilized by a Combat Pragmatist, and commonly followed up by Instant Soprano and/or Share the Male Pain. Not an uncommon aftereffect of Tar and Feathers.
WARNING, Reading these may cause extreme paranoia about injury to the pubic area and wincing in sympathy pains. Yes, even if you're female. Also, this is never as funny in Real Life as it is on TV and can actually cause very nasty injuries, so unless you are in a real self-defense scenario, Don't Try This at Home."
t09604,GuileHero,"Completing a triangle with the Action Hero and the Science Hero, the Guile Hero is a hero who operates by playing politics and manipulating the bad guys. The Guile Hero trades swords and guns (or science and technology) for charm, wit, political and/or financial acumen, and an in-depth knowledge of human nature. The Chain of Deals, along with the Social Engineering and Gambit Index tropes are all at the Guile Hero's fingertips. Often, a Guile Hero will manipulate the other good guys and a whole bunch of innocent bystanders as part of his scheme to bring down the Big Bad, though he'll take care to ensure the other characters aren't truly harmed in the process (and if he fails, he'll be very sorry). The Guile Hero is likely to be a politician or a businessman, and engage in Battles of Wits. If he has superpowers, then he's likely to think that Heart Is an Awesome Power.
The Guile Hero could be a good analog to the Manipulative Bastard (though there can be occasional overlap if they are willing to manipulate their friends as well as their enemies): the Guile Hero is unambiguously a good guy with the same goals as any Action Hero or Science Hero. Though some other heroes may be unhappy with being manipulated by the Guile Hero, it is made clear to the reader that this character both has a heroic goal and is not (usually) Jumping Off the Slippery Slope into becoming a Well-Intentioned Extremist. When a Guile Hero suffers an Epic Fail, it falls under the Too Clever by Half trope.
The Guile Hero combines elements of The Chessmaster, The Trickster and The Manipulative Bastard without having to be all of these. A Guile Hero isn't necessarily The Chessmaster: the Guile Hero is simply a hero who uses wit, charm, and skill to mislead and set up the bad guys, whereas The Chessmaster is often devoted to grander schemes and more likely to use Chess Motifs. A Manipulative Bastard tends to be more personal and controlling in his manipulations. A Guile Hero need not be a master manipulator; ""guile"" can mean ""shrewdness"" instead of ""deceit"". As for The Trickster, a Guile Hero is just as likely to be The Stoic or a ""Stop Having Fun"" Guy as the fun-loving and mischevious trickster. The Chain of Deals is just as valid a tool for these characters as The Plan, and a Guile Hero may very well be a grown-up High School Hustler.
In The Team, the Guile Hero is most likely to be The Face of the troupe and/or The Smart Guy, though a particularly bright Leader or Lancer can also fit in. If The Chick uses her emotional influence to the extreme and combines it with quick wits and words, she can also grow into one. The Guile Hero is also frequently a Sixth Ranger, and if a Sixth Ranger is also a Guile Hero, then he tends to be Sixth Ranger Traitor.
Compare the Young Conqueror, which is a young example of this trope taken Up to Eleven with a side of Take Over the World ambition as well. May overlap with Good Is Not Dumb. Compare Silk Hiding Steel when a Proper Lady feels like plotting. Very, very rarely will this overlap with Small Steps Hero, due to the latter being unwilling to sacrifice innocent parties—but manipulating the villains is just fine. The Evil Counterpart of the Guile Hero is the Magnificent Bastard.
In some rare cases, the Guile Hero may be a character who is more powerful than anyone else (either through magic or science and technology) and could easily solve everything himself. But doing so may violate his principles.
Not under any circumstances to be confused with a certain Sonic Boom-tossing airman whose theme song goes with everything."
t09608,GuiltComplex,"On the one hand, you have The Atoner, a person who committed a terrible deed and after a Heel–Face Turn, resolves to spend their entire life trying to make up for it. On the other hand, you have the person who Apologizes a Lot, someone who apologizes out of habit, even if they know whatever happened was not their fault.
Now, enter Guilt Complex, the bastard child of those two tropes.
A person with a Guilt Complex is someone who routinely puts blame on their own shoulders. It differs from The Atoner in that whatever happened cannot possibly be their fault, and their justification for blaming themselves is usually a stretch, sometimes taken to ridiculous levels. It differs from Apologizes a Lot in that it's not just a Verbal Tic or a way of expressing sympathy for someone else, they truly believe if they had done something different, whatever negative situation they were in would not have ever happened. And they feel this way all the time, in all situations, to the point where it basically becomes one of their main character traits. Often takes the form of ""I should have..."" or ""If I hadn't...""
A Guilt Complex can be born from many different personalities:
Expect the True Companions to initially try and make this person see how they are not at fault, until it happens again, and again, and again, and again, and in the end induces much eye-rolling, resignation, or even Lampshade Hanging from other characters.
If a character indulges in this a little too much, it's not uncommon for a supporting character to snap them out of it by accusing them of arrogance for the attitude. Expect to see something along the lines of ""you think you're the only one [responsible for/saddened by/involved in] this?!""
Often instrumental to the Heroic BSoD. See also It's All My Fault where the character usually says this to the point it becomes the Guilt Complex trait. Contrast with Never My Fault, the inversion of this trope.
Please note: When you add examples, try to give as much detail as possible. Remember this trope is about a behavioral pattern."
t09674,HairOfGoldHeartOfGold,"The character is a blonde. Therefore, obviously, she is young, beautiful, pure, kind, and innocent, and the innocence can range up to Virgin Power. If she fights, it's reluctantly and she tends to avoid violence where she can.
Victorian literature would also use it to portray her as delicate and fragile, if not actually the Ill Girl—being, of course, Too Good for This Sinful Earth. This part is largely a Discredited Trope. (The only trace of this in Real Life is that blonde hair tends to be a feature of younger people—it tends to darken to mousy brown or turn reddish throughout the bearer's early life.)
Men falling under this trope are rarer, but the blond hero can also have Hair of Gold. Such a hero is more action-oriented than the Hair of Gold heroine, but he is also good, wholesome, kind to those weaker than himself, modest, and prone to be the Chaste Hero or Celibate Hero.
Often paired with Innocent Blue Eyes.
Compare and Contrast Mystical White Hair, where a pale hair color denotes arcane traits, with or without Incorruptible Pure Pureness. Also compare the popular and fun-loving Everyone Loves Blondes, and contrast White Hair, Black Heart, for when light hair is paired with an evil character.
NOTE: Not all blondes belong in this list. Not even all good blondes. If the character does not match the personality type, then they do not have Hair of Gold, Heart of Gold and should be listed only if they exploit the expectation."
t09695,HalfHumanHybrid,"The results of an Interspecies Romance and/or Genetic Engineering.
This is present in most unrealistic fictional genres, including Science Fiction (or, rather Space Opera), fantasy, horror, etc. In reality, many closely related Earth species share over 99% of their DNA, but cannot produce viable offspring. This makes it extremely unlikely that creatures of different planets would be able to interbreed, but then again, Mars does need women.
In fictionland, human beings can conceive children with any intelligent species in existence. Demons, elves, aliens, vampires, you name it — not only will a human sleep with it, they'll engender children. The mother is in a majority of cases the human with the non-human father providing the powers. If they are not physically viable, rest assured there are scientists somewhere who will fiddle with DNA until a hybrid is created. They'll do it even if there's no reason to think the creature should have DNA in the first place. That's Earth's solution for storing your genome. It requires a lot of supporting stuff in the cells, and not even everything on Earth uses it. Thankfully, the Rule of Cool and Rule of Sexy let us mix it up with whatever the Green-Skinned Space Babe's ancestors evolved to store their genomes in. Good thing there are No Biochemical Barriers! And if you can't find a scientist to do it for you, you're in luck. A Wizard Did It is just as handy a Hand Wave.
Rarely does either species accept the mixed marriage, much less said hybrid, though. After all, What Measure Is a Non-Human? — and the hybrid's very existence is proof of a lack of Species Loyalty.
Sometimes a particular type of hybrid becomes common enough that they can stop relying on their parent races to make new members and just mate with each other to sustain their own race.
If the hybrid is a positive character, it connects the audience with them, giving them familiar characteristics and a closer point-of-view into the otherwise alien culture, or else, an ""outsider"" character for protagonists to befriend... or at the very least, they'll have the power to fight one-half of their heritage, almost certainly if that one-half is vampire.
Positive characters also tend to pick up all the advantages and powers of their component races with no disadvantages or weaknesses. A half-vampire might pick up Super Strength and Voluntary Shapeshifting without having a weakness to sunlight or a thirst for blood, for example, or a half-elf gets magic and an extended lifespan (funny, that). Being a Half-Human Hybrid is almost always a plus for protagonists, although the characters usually don't think so. Frequently it's because of self-image issues, possibly due to people getting freaked out at them having horns and hooves or the like. Females tend to be luckier in this regard than males, due to being seen as an exotic beauty.
If the hybrid is a negative character, this will make their inhumanity more personal. They might have suffered Half-Breed Discrimination, representing what prejudice on both species' part can produce. For extra angst, the character's conception might have been less-than-consensual.
The concept as a whole, thanks to A Wizard Did It, tends to fly better in supernatural settings — when it comes to, say, demons, who can say it wouldn't work that way? It's not like we can do a DNA test on the Prince of Darkness. Yet. In mythology and folklore, this is known as a ""liminal being"", like Merlin (who in some stories is half-demon) or centaurs. Also in mythology, for hybrids who are half human/half god, see Semi-Divine, and Nephilim, which are commonly portrayed as angel or demon/human hybrids.
For those people who turn into hybrids, see Animorphism and Mix-and-Match Critter. A character born human but changed to be part-nonhuman later on would be an Artificial Hybrid. If the character was already a different non-human species, or gets hybridized a second time, they become a Hybrid Monster.
Not to be confused with Little Bit Beastly and Beast Man, for characters that look like this trope but are actually a fantastical or extraterrestrial species that (for some reason) looks a lot like us with some added fur, ears, or a tail.
See also Interspecies Romance. A common result of a Fantastic Romance. See Dhampyr for half vampire/half human hybrids specifically. May lead to Uneven Hybrids or Heinz Hybrids, if the family tree does not end with them. An inter-species humanoid hybrid that averts the ""half human"" part is a Nonhuman Humanoid Hybrid. If the non-human parent is from an Always Chaotic Evil race, this trope may result from the human being Raised by Orcs."
t09746,HandsOffParenting,"Former hippies and romantics make irresponsible parents. As often as not, the parents may be rarely home: if there are any adult children, they're either similarly absent or in their 20s and insufficiently motivated to leave the house, which is a disaster zone without any discipline or structure to speak of. After all, who needs structure and discipline? It just stunts kids' growth.
With this level of benign neglect, the kids usually somehow turn out all right... or at least self-sufficient, if not a bit cynical. Bonus points if the mother is an artist.
See also Adults Are Useless, Disappeared Dad, Missing Mom, When You Coming Home, Dad?, Free-Range Children, Hippie Parents, Minor Living Alone, Parental Abandonment, and Parental Neglect.
Might be a consequence of a parent who is Allergic to Routine or Desperately Seeking A Purpose In Life. Polar opposite of Meddling Parents, Overprotective Dad and My Beloved Smother."
t09768,HappilyAdopted,"Once upon a time, being an adoptee was a raw deal. Either your adoptive or foster parents were Muggles—caring, but utterly, utterly clueless—or they were downright abusive, presumably because you weren't their ""blood."" If it wasn't adoptive parents, it was step-parents. Either you went Gene Hunting, found your REAL parents, and were loved for the rest of your life, or you moved out, lived on your own, and promptly forgot about them. Even if your adoptive parents were fairly harmless, if you ever found your real family, you forgot all about the people who raised you. Blood's thicker and all that, right?
Or so it used to be.
Because there are some problems in implying that adoptive parents are either bad (in the Abusive Parents variety) or unnecessary/useless (the Gene Hunting variant), many adoptees have a better deal. They're adopted. They know they're adopted—if not right off the bat, then it gets revealed to them that they are. Their reaction is... not to care. Oh, sure—maybe they care at first. Maybe they spend some time wondering about their birth parents, their origins, and where they really come from, but after some thought, they come to one conclusion: No matter who they were born to, they know who cared for them when they were sick, who helped them when they were down, and, most importantly, who loved them. When love's in play, the truth becomes obvious: Those who love them are their real family, blood be damned. Usually, the kid will eventually tell the parent that, throw in a hug and Heartwarming Moments are made as their bond grows stronger.
What happens in cases where the child in question is a Wonder Child, and has celestial or other fantastic parentage? While in older works, the Muggle Foster Parents would frequently be forgotten about, in this trope, the child tends to accept both sets of ""parents"" as being real. If the child is a Heartwarming Orphan whose ""original"" parents died, the same thing may also apply. Thus, this has often become a component of the modern Happily Ever After: What will happen to the orphan child protagonist? He/she gets adopted by the adult good guys! Everybody is happy!
Truth in Television, (thankfully) as evidenced by the Real Life examples.
Can be an application of Nurture over Nature.
The counterpart trope to Adoption Is Not an Option.
Kids Raised by Wolves are often happy adoptees. Compare with Babies Ever After. Contrast Raised by Orcs. See True Companions, which is closely related (by adoption, of course). An Adoption Diss might be used against these characters for Kick the Dog purposes if it's clear to the audience that this trope applies. Also see Orphan's Ordeal for the flipside of the coin."
t09772,HappilyMarried,"Against all the odds, in defiance of the laws of drama, spitting in the face of the Awful Wedded Life, there is... the Happily Married couple.
This is a couple, Alpha or Beta, who are in love and not wangsting it up dysfunctionally all the time. They avoid Poor Communication Kills, won't jump to conclusions, and treat each other with love and respect. In short, whatever troubles they have are minor and don't lead to the misanthropy of No Accounting for Taste or The Masochism Tango.
Both inside and outside of Romance Parental Abandonment, Shipping Bed Death and the Cartwright Curse tend to kill them off like flies. Aiding this is that most drama considers the above ""boring!"" (remember, Rule of Drama) and will usually try to make things ""interesting!"" with ""plot twists"" that threaten to split them up, and otherwise fill their path with rocks to make them Star-Crossed Lovers. (Their safest bet is as the Foil to a more turbulent couple.)
The net effect of having a Happily Married couple in a series is one of stability. (As a general rule, Happily Married couples with kids will be depicted as more loving and more stable than those without.) Just having them around gives viewers and characters in the show an emotional anchor and safety net, as well as someones to root for while the Official Couple is deciding Will They or Won't They?. (Occasionally, They Do!) Needless to say, most viewers will thusly become very protective of said couple and complain when authors needlessly torment them.
These couples benefit from The Power of Love. In addition, any time a sequel is set a generation later than the original, the main couple from the original will probably have this type of relationship to show that they did get a Happy Ending — and Babies Ever After to prove it.
Despite some fiction likening this to a Discredited Trope (partly because common knowledge dictates that happy marriages are ill suited for drama. Whether common knowledge is right or not is another matter entirely), a lot of people out there would call this Truth in Television, which is why we won't list all those examples. (Congrats to you!) Apparently the secret is to understand that you will end up arguing at some point and that does not mean you are no longer in love but keep working at your marriage, talk to each other, do little things all the time, and never confuse falling in love and being in love; they feel different. There's absolutely no shame in simply getting along well, if it works for the two of you.
Not to be confused with Sickeningly Sweethearts, which is basically puppy love. They can overlap, but it's rare. This trope usually gives viewers warm fuzzy feeling instead of tasting like diabetes, though the cynicism of the viewers still has to be taken into account. If and when they have kids, they will often become Good Parents.
When this overlaps with Arranged Marriage, it's a Perfectly Arranged Marriage. When this overlaps with the characters being unrepentant villains, it's Unholy Matrimony. When it turns out that they're not really as happy as they let on, it's Happy Marriage Charade."
t09878,HaveAGayOldTime,"A cross between Accidental Innuendo and Unusual Euphemism. This trope occurs when ""language drift""—natural changes in the common vocabulary—causes a word or phrase originally intended as wholly innocuous to be potentially taken as startling, confusing or just plain funny in a different time or place. Usually relates to sexual euphemisms, but can also involve other sensitive concepts. Political correctness sometimes comes into play.
Even very slight changes in usage can produce this effect; until recently, a man might speak of his attraction to a ""young girl"" and mean a twentysomething. Nowadays she'd be young, or a girl, but not both. And sometimes the expression still has an innocent meaning that is at least as valid as the naughty onenote For instance, ""young girl"" generally won't raise eyebrows if the speaker is older and isn't sexualizing her, but now there are just too many people with their minds in the gutter.
Compare with Hilarious in Hindsight, of which this is arguably a Sub-Trope. See also Double Entendre or Intentionally Awkward Title for when this trope is invoked entirely intentionally, Separated by a Common Language for the spatial analogue, and Get Thee to a Nunnery for the reverse process.
Keep in mind that some of these words actually did have their modern meaning at the time they were used, but only within certain sections of the populace. The meaning of the word ""gay"" began to change as early as 1870 among the criminal classes of New York, where it originally meant ""prostitute"" (yes, before The Gay '90s); around 1900 the meaning changed to ""homosexual prostitute"" and within five years of that to simply ""homosexual"". This means that in some cases the writers are using the words deliberately in order to get crap past the radar. note It would be amusing if people from The Gay '90s Time Traveled to today, and wondered why there were people who opposed prostitutes getting married, and happy marriages in general.
Some of these examples result from the euphemism treadmill, whereby terms are repeatedly replaced as the previous word falls into such a state of misuse that it cannot be recovered. The words ""idiot"", ""moron"", and ""imbecile"" started as clinical terms, referring to people with IQs below 75, 50, and 25, respectively. As these terms fell into common use as insults, they were replaced by a kinder and gentler term: ""mentally retarded"". After decades of that being used as an insult, ""retarded"" is now considered so offensive that some people want it classified as hate speech. The term used to describe people with life-changing diseases or injuries followed a similar path, from ""crippled"" to ""disabled"" to ""handicapped"" to ""physically challenged""; when terms like ""handi-capable"" and ""differently abled"" were proposed, it came across as Political Correctness Gone Mad and people generally agreed to stop messing with it.
Racist terminology is also a prime example of this. The infamous ""N-word"" (which is so virulent it cannot be even used clinically in many places anymore) used to be common language, even without racist overtones. For example, ""nigger babies"" used to be a name for a popular candy, while Agatha Christie even used the title Ten Little Niggers for her arguably most famous work; even back then the N-word was considered risky so it was retitled Ten Little Indians for US publication, which annoyed another group of people, so they eventually settled on And Then There Were None. Use of the N-word by productions in which it is specifically used as a criticism/condemnation of racism (e.g. All in the Family, Blazing Saddles) is often misunderstood by modern audiences.
Words changed meaning less frequently before the advent of radio and television, and when they did change, the transformation could be slow (as seen with ""gay"" above). It took over a hundred years for the primary meaning of the verb ""want"" to change from ""lack"" to ""desire"". Television sped things up: it took only a few weeks in the 70s for the meaning of ""boob"" to change from ""dummy"" to ""breast"" among the general public. Naturally, with the advent of the uncensored Internet, words can change meaning almost overnight these days.
Compare Values Dissonance, ""Funny Aneurysm"" Moment, and You Keep Using That Word (a common cause of this if it happens enough); see also Unfortunate Names, which sometimes result from this. Get Thee to a Nunnery is the inverse.

t09986,HeelFaceTurn,"When a bad guy turns good. This usually makes for a good plot, for three reasons:
There are also various in-story motivations for the bad guy to make the turn:
Sadly, it sometimes leads to Redemption Equals Death, and when it doesn't, someone still needs to draw their ""Get out of Jail Free"" Card. Otherwise they may find the good guys unwilling to believe them; their conversion met with a Heel–Face Door-Slam (or they may ""merely"" find themselves Reformed, but Rejected). On the other hand, the bad guy may reject their chance at turning over a new leaf altogether, in which case it's Redemption Rejection.
The many reasons and the probability for a turn are listed in the Sorting Algorithm of Face-Heel Turning; probability is directly proportional to popularity. A very common act for the lone female character in any evil group, sometimes by a Mistreatment-Induced Betrayal. Beware, some authors know the stereotypes of Heel Face Turning and will play with it accordingly.
The term ""Heel Face Turn"" comes from Professional Wrestling, in which an evil wrestler (a ""heel"") sometimes has a change of heart and becomes good, thereby becoming a ""babyface"". Magazines and other promotional material from the various wrestling leagues comment on various wrestlers' changes in alignment nearly as frequently as they cover events in the ring themselves.
Compare the Reverse Mole, who is secretly working for the good guys all along. May be the result of a person that was Good All Along. When someone who doesn't care one way or the other is forced to fight they become Neutral No Longer.
This is the opposite of a Face–Heel Turn and is generally found in stories with Black and White Morality. It has two subtropes: Heel–Face Brainwashing, more or less the opposite of Brainwashed and Crazy, and High-Heel–Face Turn (usually the redefining moment for a Dark Chick). See also Mook–Face Turn when the bad guy doing it is a Mook, and Heel–Race Turn when an entire faction does it. If a character keeps switching from one side to the other and back, they're in a Heel–Face Revolving Door. If they turns face, but still acts like a heel, they're Reformed, but Not Tamed. If a character pretends to reform, only to be revealed as Evil All Along, they're a Heel–Face Mole. If someone reforms because of faith, they're in a Heel–Faith Turn. Compare and contrast, also, with Hazy Feel Turn, when is unclear and/or ambiguous the sincerity and/or the extention of the Heel-Face Turn of the character.
In real-life the nature of Heel-Face Turn and Face–Heel Turn is subjective (one person's ""seeing the light"" is another person's ""heartless betrayal or fall"" depending on what group the individual is going to or leaving). No Real Life Examples, Please!"
t09987,HeelFaithTurn,"Faith can do amazing things to a person. Even the worst villain can redeem themselves after gaining a little bit of faith in God. A Heel–Faith Turn is a situation where a villain turns good because of a deep religious experience, possibly preceded by a My God, What Have I Done? moment or a Heel Realization. As a result, the former villain often becomes a Good Shepherd and/or Badass Preacher and an Atoner.
The title is a pun on Heel–Face Turn, directly inspired by Faith–Heel Turn, which is this trope's opposite. Compare Easy Evangelism. Subtrope of Turn to Religion.
Has nothing to do with Faith Lehane from Buffy the Vampire Slayer."
t09989,HeelRealization,"Few things are more crushing than realizing that you're one of the bad guys. You might exclaim My God, What Have I Done? and perhaps shed Tears of Remorse. Or in some cases, you realize you're even worse than you thought you were. Either way, it's the moment you know you're in the wrong.
It may lead to becoming The Atoner, a Redemption Quest, or Redemption Equals Death, or, if the author is feeling particularly vindictive, to a Heel–Face Door-Slam. Conversely, may turn a Well-Intentioned Extremist Necessarily Evil, or force them to admit that there is No Place for Me There. There's also the possibility to ignore the realization and go for Redemption Rejection. Sometimes these people were just working for someone who turned out to be doing horrible things. A common form is to Kick the Morality Pet and/or realize that Being Evil Sucks.
Common when The Dark Side Will Make You Forget or when Big Brother Is Employing You.
Compare Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!, He Who Fights Monsters, Then Let Me Be Evil, Jerkass Realization, Regretful Traitor, and Unwitting Pawn. Contrast with Knight Templar (who never realizes he's a villain) and Card-Carrying Villain (who never thinks he's a good guy in the first place). Also see Tomato in the Mirror, when one of the good guys realizes he was a sleeper agent all the time.
Compare and contrast Evil Me Scares Me.
For the direct opposite, see Face Realization. Or for the other direct opposite, see Obliviously Evil. See also You Are Better Than You Think You Are for where the character fails to see they are nobler than they give themselves credit for."
t10066,HereThereWereDragons,"Once upon a time, there was magic. Kings had wizards as courtiers. Knights and saints slew dragons. Shame those days have gone by, huh?
Here There Were Dragons is the idea that the past was a time when magic was everywhere, as opposed to our boring old mundane present. This isn't a case where magic went underground or adopted some Masquerade to avoid yet another Witch Hunt; no, this is a case where magic has disappeared almost entirely. But, who knows? It could always come back around again or at least the dragons could, if there were actual dragons...
Compare with Death of the Old Gods and Götterdämmerung, where it's the gods that have left or died (respectively). See also The Time of Myths. If the story is about the magic going away it's, well, The Magic Goes Away. See also End of an Age. Not to be confused with Here There Be Dragons; there never were any real dragons in that trope."
t10092,HeroicBastard,"While the badass hero or the Anti-Hero may get called a bastard, it's not usually meant literally. This trope is for the heroic protagonist for whom ""bastard"" is just a factual description, not a comment on their personality. They could easily be very pleasant and well-mannered, but their parents never married.
Until fairly recently in fiction, a child born out of wedlock was often expected to have a treacherous or villainous nature just due to the fact of his illegitimate birth, which of course is how the term ""bastard"" came to mean someone who was...well, a bastard. In modern times, however, with the rise of more liberal and humane attitudes — as well as the rapid increase in unwed motherhood as a societal phenomenon — it has become less acceptable to assume that a person will have a tendency toward evil behavior just because Dad never gave Mom a ring or because Mom or Dad had the kid when one of the two already gave a ring to another person.
Back in the day, this could be a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy. Since a child born out of wedlock would be the target of all kinds of discrimination and would not be allowed to participate in some central parts of society (like church services), they often had to become ruthless, cunning rogues just to have a chance of surviving. Especially since the fathers didn't have to care for them (and often wouldn't) and the mothers may have used the kid to let out their frustration about ""those goddamn men"". Fatherless children have a documented tendency to violence, suicide, lack of self-control, and poverty — so, statistically speaking, there's something to the stereotype, though how much of this is due to the social stigma is left as an exercise to the reader. But most bastards manage to rise above these expectations.
In fact, modern authors have found that making their hero a bastard can have some valuable dramatic benefits. Perhaps the parents never married because one of them vanished mysteriously; this can lead to a juicy revelation later in the story when it is discovered that Mom or Dad is someone very important to the plot. If the writer is feeling generous, the vanished parent could be a local power figure or at least wealthy. If not, the vanished parent could end up being someone the hero has to fight. At a minimum, being born a bastard and getting socially snubbed for it can give your character a reason to feel mistreated yet prove his heroic character by rising above it and saving the world anyway.
Interestingly, if we look back far enough, we find that most of the greatest heroes of ancient Greek myth were born out of wedlock, making this Older Than Feudalism. However, this generally only applied if the hero's parents didn't marry because one of them was a god — most often baby-daddy Zeus, who had serious fidelity issues with his goddess wife and was forever running around impregnating mortal women with heroes. It should be also be noted that in ancient Greece, ""heroic"" did not necessarily mean nice, so many Greek heroes were bastards who were also bastards.
If a heroic character is a Child by Rape or a Son of a Whore, he usually fits this trope as well. In some cases, it may be secondary to the other one.
If the Heroic Bastard is also a heroic bastard, he's an Anti-Hero or Sociopathic Hero. And while the heroic bastard may be magnificent, he is not automatically a Magnificent Bastard. For the villainous version, see Bastard Bastard.
There are several Real Life examples, especially in the Middle Ages, as being illegitimate offspring and excluded from inheritance, heroism was sometimes the only way to eke out a decent life. The most notable examples are: William the Conqueror (previously known as ""William the Bastard"", King of England), Bertrand du Guesclin (Constable of France) and the half-siblings John of Austria (military commander who won the Battle of Lepanto for Spain) and Margaret of Parma (Governor of the Netherlands, plus Duchess of Parma and Piacenza). Since this is a very controversial topic, no further Real Life examples, please. It is sufficient to say they do exist."
t10094,HeroicBSOD,"A stunning revelation or horrible event affects a character or someone they care deeply about, leaving them shocked to the point of mentally shutting down for a while, analogous to the Blue Screen of Death. The effect is similar to passing a Despair Event Horizon, but is temporary rather than permanent. Alternatively, if, say, this occurs during a fight, a hero may have a violent outburst, killing Evil Minions and hurling their own companions aside. They may run off and have to be tracked down by their friends for Epiphany Therapy. Alone in a Crowd typically represents a milder, non-disabling form of BSOD; a related trope is Heroic Safe Mode, wherein the hero ""defaults"" to a fight or flight mindset before rebooting in safety. A Shell-Shocked Veteran may have a BSOD in their back story.
The trope name notwithstanding, the character suffering a Heroic BSOD may not necessarily be a fully-fledged hero. However, if something like this happens to a more ambiguous or mundane character, it is much more likely to be Played for Laughs or just taken less seriously. But a BSOD is never brief or trivial; the effect must involve some kind of total mental shut-down to qualify. Also, an outright villain suffering a similar effect will usually experience a Villainous Breakdown (often involving them going completely crazy instead of shutting down) or a Villainous BSoD (whereby they gain a conscience).
Possible triggers include failing in something crucial such as saving a loved one or being restricted in what you can do to help, being betrayed by a close friend, being forced to make an ""impossible"" choice (e.g. having to choose between using ""evil"" methods or laying friends open to attack), or being hit with a Breaking Speech or Armor-Piercing Question. Other tropes such as These Hands Have Killed often overlap. When the trope is Played for Laughs or used for melodramatic effect, the cause can be less substantial; deranged behavior from someone supposedly sane, seeing something completely surreal, or being hit with a Wall of Text, say.
Other people can attempt to reboot the character; Get a Hold of Yourself, Man! may work (especially in the stories where violence is always the answer), as may telling them to Quit Your Whining. The best thing that can happen to a hero suffering from a BSOD is meeting a friendly Warrior Therapist; the worst thing is meeting a hostile Warrior Therapist, as such a foe can ensure that the hero crashes completely, driving them over the edge into the Despair Event Horizon.
Even after regaining some function, a BSOD sufferer may evince a Thousand-Yard Stare, or go into 10-Minute Retirement. In the longer term, a hero may become emotionally comatose (entering an Angst Coma), obsessive and guilt-ridden, mute, or in really bad cases, a jaded violent amnesiac. A really long-term BSOD would be catatonia; Go Mad from the Revelation is the worst case. Those who remain functional but don't find a cure for the problem may eventually find Safety in Indifference or Emotion Suppression; other people may fear that they have become a Fallen Hero.
Comedy and melodramatic uses of the trope (such as a film or game reviewer having a Critic Breakdown) are far less likely to lead to long-term problems; the character simply snaps back after a few minutes. A character in a slapstick comedy show may be thrown into several blue screens in one episode, as a Running Gag.
If opponents discover a character's BSOD trigger, they may employ it as a weapon — although if they over-use it, the victim may wise up and seek treatment. Even comedy characters can find that a BSOD leads to Character Development, marking the start of a series of new experiences, or causing them to revise their world-view. Hope Is Scary is a frequent reaction to the beginning of recovery for any character. He’s Back often marks a character's full recovery, perhaps accompanied by a ""World of Cardboard"" Speech. Conversely, a character who never recovers has fallen over the Despair Event Horizon.
Compare Heroic RRoD (the physical equivalent), Freak Out!, and Deer in the Headlights. One common reaction is I Think You Broke Him. In Real Life psychology, this sort of thing is known as an acute stress reaction, or a mental breakdown, and is related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. If a character starts singing about their (or someone else's) Heroic BSOD, then it's also an example of BSoD Song
The trope is named in honor of an infamous Microsoft Windows error that indicates that the system has screwed itself big time (the technical term is ""stop error""). A particularly literal version could involve a character (preferably a supercomputer or other Artificial Intelligence) literally displaying a Blue Screen Of Death.
Individuals afflicted with this trope are often seen exhibiting the classic Thousand-Yard Stare, with its blank, emotionless expression and unfocussed, empty eyes."
t10114,HeroicSacrifice,"A character saves another/others from harm and is killed, crippled, or maimed as a result.
A bad character who was once good can redeem themselves in the last act by Taking the Bullet that was meant for The Hero, thus expunging all their previous evil, avoiding forcing The Hero to arrest or confront him, and avoiding any real life penalties like disgrace and jail. This is like Redemption Equals Death. In this case, the death and redemption come in a single act.
There are essentially three kinds of Heroic Sacrifice:
A Heroic Sacrifice usually requires that a character be Not Afraid to Die, even declaring It Has Been an Honor. If the Heroic Sacrifice was pre-planned, it's a Self-Sacrifice Scheme. Often preceded with a Sneaky Departure from the team, or a More Hero Than Thou dispute. A Friend in Need often requires it, and doing it proves your love for them. Contrast Villain's Dying Grace, when a dying villain decides to save a life. The Doomed Moral Victor fights a battle where the outcome is clear from the beginning. If the character has time to say some last words before dying, they often do so in an Obi-Wan Moment. Often a Dying Moment of Awesome. There's also the case where Someone Has to Die, which takes this Up to Eleven.
Characters who Draw Aggro may not expect to live, and thus it will also be this trope.
This is a Super-Trope, and the Sub Tropes are listed under Heroic Sacrifices.
Compare and contrast Zero-Approval Gambit (where the hero sacrifices his good name instead of his life), Sacrificial Revival Spell (where the character uses a spell to save another), Death Is the Only Option, My Death Is Just the Beginning, Inspirational Martyr (who may not be that heroic, but their deaths may inspire others to become heroes), Taking You with Me, Senseless Sacrifice, Heroic Suicide, Suicide Mission and Stupid Sacrifice.
This is generally a Death Trope. Expect SPOILERS."
t10132,HeroOfAnotherStory,"In works of fiction, it often seems like the world revolves around the Main Characters, that nothing interesting happens unless one of them is in the middle of it. And sometimes that’s true; sometimes the main cast are so important that nothing big can happen without their involvement. But other times, it’s not that the Main Characters are the only ones that stories happen to; it’s that we only see the stories that happen to the Main Characters.
It turns out the supporting characters have their own adventures going on off-screen, where they’re the stars and the Main Characters only make cameo appearances. These characters are the Heroes of Another Story: we may not see much of their adventures, but it adds something to the fictional world if we know these people continue to lead interesting lives even when the Main Characters aren’t around.
On occasion, we'll see one of these characters get A Day in the Limelight and they'll become The Protagonist for an episode. This often makes the real cast the Hero of Another Story for the episode, as they'll be off on their own adventures in the meantime. Alternatively, a P.O.V. Sequel might be done to tell the same story from their perspective.
Another Side, Another Story is a subtrope, where you actually get to play the other stories, but not before you unlock their heroes first.
Compare Supporting Leader. Naturally, this will result when someone encounters the main character(s) of another series via Crossover or a Poorly Disguised Pilot. See also Little Hero, Big War, for settings that often have a bunch of heroes of other stories. See also Superman Stays Out of Gotham for cases where the main characters have powerful allies who are busy dealing with problems of their own. Depending on how well written the character is they could become an Ensemble Dark Horse. When these sorts of characters are only hinted at, see Unknown Character. The villainous inverse would be Villain of Another Story.
Compare Lower-Deck Episode, where minor characters get a brief chance to shine, or Spin-Off, where the character gets an entire series devoted to them."
t10161,HeterosexualLifePartners,"A trope old as time itself. Two extremely close friends or partners, of the same gender, who are as close or closer than a romantic couple. They aren't romantically linked, but they might suffer withdrawals from not being around each other. There might be much drama over a potential ""break-up"". When one gets a romantic partner, you can almost certainly expect the Friend Versus Lover quarrel to be epic. Though despite the trope name, the characters in question are not necessarily both heterosexual.
Sometimes this is an extreme form of an Odd Couple, in that the two are different as night and day. Those Two Guys may acquire this label, as may the title characters of any show with a title of the form X and Y. Don't expect them to be friendly to each other, though; quite a few are Vitriolic Best Buds. In adventure stories, they are often Blood Brothers. These pairs usually go through a lot of Ho Yay situations and can sometimes have the tendency to bicker Like an Old Married Couple. The pair may be Mistaken for Gay by those around them.
Works often lampshade, mock or play with the relationship by throwing in some Homoerotic Subtext, but that's by no means necessary. For fans' delight at such scenes or ship teases, see Ho Yay.
If the two friends are different genders, they're Platonic Life-Partners, perhaps Like Brother and Sister. When an entire group are life partners, they're True Companions. Compare Chastity Couple, whose relationship is romantic but not sexual."
t10186,HiddenDepths,"People are rarely all that they seem at first glance. Without getting into An Aesop about books and covers and ugly ducks and swans and frogs that when kissed turn into robots, it's fairly true to say that people are mostly visually oriented, and go by first impressions. So when it turns out that The Big Guy who can bend steel bars is also a Harvard alumnus with a penchant for pontificating on the power of prose, people are justifiably taken aback.
This is not so much a character type being subverted as it is getting Character Development in unexpected directions. Much like Playing Against Type, it can be something that seemingly goes against the character type, or combines two different, seemingly opposite roles or characters into one more Round Character. The talent or quirk is rarely impossible for the character to have, just unexpected: people aren't just their job or surface personality after all. The Smart Guy who's a cooking wiz because he had to take care of his younger siblings, or The Ditz who's a Black Belt because her dad wanted her to be able to defend herself are two examples. Hidden Depths can be discovered in Back Story or organically as a story progresses, but if used improperly can crop up in a Plot Tailored to the Party to give a character the necessary skills. Why did they never mention it? ""You Didn't Ask"".
If the audience is aware of the depths but not all the characters are, Dramatic Irony is almost bound to occur. If it happens gradually, it's essentially Flanderization in reverse. May be demonstrated when a character catches the Smart Ball.
For more examples, see the index."
t10298,HistoricalDomainCharacter,"Simply put, it's taking a well-known person from Real Life history and using this person as a character in a story. This does mean any work of that kind, whether it's Historical Fiction, a Hollywood History story, a piece of Alternate History, or a well-researched and accurate biopic of events. Needless to say, there isn't necessarily any similarity in personality between the real person and the character in the story. They may even be classical composers who were secretly sleeper agents for extraterrestrials. Whatever works.
Naturally this covers a lot of works (save for non-fiction), but given how often people can disagree about real history and our present, it would be hard to draw a line between which fictional works would fit and which fictional works wouldn't. Thus all are included.
Note that despite this trope having ""Historical"" in the name, present-day living people are also included in this list, as long as they have a very significant social impact or cultural legacy that will cause them to be remembered in future media. Please remove troping in these people's pages as you browse.
Obviously, the vast majority of (in)famous historical figures are long deceased. If a story mentions real-life dead people by characters living in the present-day, or if they're featured in historical flashbacks, then they also double as Posthumous Characters. Also compare this trope with Public Domain Character, Anonymous Ringer, Roman à Clef, and Real-Person Fic."
t10347,HoistByHisOwnPetard,"The villain's own weapon or malicious plan is the cause of their downfall and/or death. This could be something as big as a Mad Scientist who creates monsters and/or a Weapon of Mass Destruction getting killed by their own creation, or as small as a prankster accidentally setting off their own trap.
In media intended for young children, it is often a Death by Irony that releases the hero from the unpleasantness of actually killing their enemy; a more specific type of Self-Disposing Villain.
If the hero is not responsible for the death in any way, it can also be a Karmic Death.
A ""petard""note Derived from and related to the Medieval French verb peter, to break wind was an explosive device (basically a bucket full of gunpowder, and a medieval ancestor of the land mine) intended to demolish gates and fortified walls; being too close to the detonating explosive could well toss the engineers who planted it into the air. Thus, this term literally means ""Blown into the air by one's own bomb"" and was first coined by William Shakespeare in Hamlet, though the original quote was ""hoist with his own petard"".
If an evil Eldritch Abomination, God of Evil or otherwise supernatural evil entity gets Punched Out by the same powers it gave, you have a Faustian Rebellion in action. If it's an Ancient Conspiracy, Government Conspiracy or other organisation whose Applied Phlebotinum is empowering the one who will bring them down, you have a Phlebotinum Rebel. If it's done by making him hit himself, it's Stop Hitting Yourself. If it's a Mook, long abused, who finally snaps and turns against him at the last moment, it's The Dog Bites Back. If it's a Video Game boss whose attacks can be redirected back at them (tennis-style or otherwise), it's Tactical Suicide Boss. Gone Horribly Right is a sub-trope where a Super Prototype works too well, destroying the person or persons who created it and/or threatening the world/galaxy/universe. If it's a vehicle that you just stole, it's Vehicular Turnabout.
Can be the result of Didn't Think This Through, but not necessarily. Compare Nice Job Fixing It, Villain!, A Taste of Their Own Medicine, and Beat Them at Their Own Game. The Streisand Effect is a subtrope of this, when the petard is censorship.
For examples involving literal (explosive) petards, look up Explosive Stupidity, Grenade Hot Potato, and Pineapple Surprise.
As this is often a Death Trope, all Spoilers will be unmarked ahead. Beware."
t10495,HonorBeforeReason,"Being a good and honorable person is anything but easy; it requires personal sacrifice that most normal people aren't willing to make, either out of self-interest, self-preservation, selfishness or any other number of reasons.
Heroes who abide by this trope more often than not act in a manner that, although morally sound and honorable, is far from the most practical solution. Quite often this kind of decent, chivalrous behavior will come at a great cost to the hero's happiness, kill them outright, or similarly leave them a destroyed human being. A villain aware of such a gallant hero is bound to use Flaw Exploitation against them as well.
Characters who adhere to this trope are generally more committed to their code of ethics than to their own self-preservation. They believe in a pre-defined set of rules which universally apply, and will not break them, even if their own death results from adhering to them in one particular instance. For them, acting dishonorably is a A Fate Worse Than Death.
In stories on the idealistic end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism, the more the insistence of honorable behavior seems impractical, or even insane, the greater the chance that it becomes the thing that turns a hopeless situation into victory. In stories on the cynical end, however, this trope will overlap with Too Dumb to Live.
An especially poignant situation is Turn the Other Cheek. Often, and perhaps running counter to the theme of honor besting all, the hero has to be aided by Big Damn Villains, who are able to cross that final line that their integrity would not allow.
When done well and/or consistently, such acts of decency fan the flames of idealism in the viewers' hearts; they make them cheer even harder for the hero and inspire a desire to be just as pure and honorable. When done poorly, the term ""Lawful Stupid"" comes to mind, as does Martyr Without a Cause.
This trope is also subject to some degree of Values Dissonance, as some actions will be seen as both honorable and reasonable to a society with a certain set of beliefs. For instance, a society which believes in an afterlife ruled by a Higher Power that judges according to a rigid code of morality would see the ""honorable"" choice as being also ""reasonable"" by virtue of the fact that the person making it is sacrificing a temporary advantage in this life for a permanent one in the life to come. As another example, a man may be challenged to a duel over something stupid, but if he lives in an honor society where his peers will refuse to do business with him, not let their daughters marry his sons, etc. if he refuses to defend his honor, then he may feel like he has to do it even if he doesn't care about honor for its own sake.
Often features in I Gave My Word, In Its Hour of Need, Rebellious Rebel; the Proud Warrior Race Guy typically follows the rule, as well. What You Are in the Dark always reveals the same character as when they are seen. When a character does this to the point that it angers their more corrupt superiors, expect them to become The Last DJ. The McCoy is the personification of this trope. More Hero Than Thou disputes are sometimes this, when only one character is really suitable for the sacrifice. Can lead to the hero being prone to fall to things like the False Innocence Trick. See also Victorious Loser and Small Steps Hero.
Shoot the Dog is this trope's opposite: Reason Before Honor. Usually not a trait of a Combat Pragmatist due to their dirty approach to fighting often being seen as dishonorable.
Compare/contrast with Incorruptible Pure Pureness, Good Is Old-Fashioned, The Fettered, Martyrdom Culture, Revenge Before Reason, and Noble Demon (the Evil Counterpart). Contrast Combat Pragmatist, No-Nonsense Nemesis, and Blind Obedience."
t10505,HookerWithAHeartOfGold,"Any sex worker (prostitute, stripper, adult film actor, etc.) who has some baseline goodness, often a woman who becomes a love interest for a main character. Underneath the sex kitten exterior lies a very kind and good-natured flower. If they don't get killed off by an angry pimp or another villain, you can typically expect their past to either be quickly forgotten or be mentioned/alluded to constantly.
This is a common trait of characters in the ""street-walker"" category — they are generally poor and desperate, have gone through the most embittering experiences, and frequently have debilitating drug addictions that wreak havoc on their looks and their personalities. Not that you can tell, of course, as Hollywood hookers tend to be gorgeous and never suffer from meth bugs or malnutrition.
This trope is Older Than Feudalism, dating all the way back to Aspasianote Who may or may not have been one in real life. with Pericles.
Contrast with the Gold Digger; compare with the High-Class Call Girl and Ethical Slut. In The Wild West, this character is properly called a ""Soiled Dove"". If they're a mother, that child will be a Son of a Whore. If Asian, they may also be an Asian Hooker Stereotype. Is liable to become a Heroic Seductress under certain circumstances. And possibly a Miss Kitty.
This trope is only about prostitutes and other professional sex workers. For people who have casual sex for the pleasure of it rather than for money, see instead Good Bad Girl and Ethical Slut. However, the tropes can overlap when it comes to the more benevolent forms of sex work or full-scale Unproblematic Prostitution. Both are liable to be against any form of sex work that is exploitative and/or emotionally damaging but might consider some forms relatively safe and thus approve of them.
Occasionally, those who have actually been damaged by prostitution may still fit this trope. Expect a Broken Bird who needs to be shown true kindness to bring out their golden heart underneath bitter exteriors.
This is a character type that shows up in a lot of Christian fiction. Can be done extremely well (a la Francine Rivers) or not.
Some may take pity on a protagonist and offer them a place in This Bed of Rose's."
t10518,HopeSpot,"The Protagonist is about to face utter defeat. Suddenly, he finds a glimmer of hope, a reservoir for strength, a possible way out, a ray of light, a Forgotten Superweapon, what have you… only to be crushed cruelly by the bad guys returning in force. Think of it as the opposite of Near-Villain Victory.
Hope spots can be used to add drama to an extended encounter with a villain and will often culminate with the hero getting up after a seemingly decisive blow. However, if handled poorly, it can detract from a story.
Subtropes include Diabolus ex Machina. In extreme versions, may presage a Cruel Twist Ending. The Kaizo Trap is a subtrope exclusive to video games. Your Princess Is in Another Castle! also counts as this when the heroes think that everything is over for them, but the villains escape and the heroes have to take them down again.
Note that this trope can be shaded by Values Dissonance: villains obviously wish to triumph (or at least come through in one piece) just as much as heroes do, so a Hope Spot for a villain also counts, no matter how much despair it would cause heroic characters.
Any visible sigh of relief? After escaping imminent peril? Take a Moment to Catch Your Death.
The direct opposite of Darkest Hour. One reason why Hope Is Scary and the Hope Bringer are not always welcome. The Hope Crusher loves engineering this sort of situation.
See also Yank the Dog's Chain.
Due to the bait-and-switch nature of this trope and how heavily it relies on the audience going in blind, expect spoilers."
t10596,HotSkittyOnWailordAction,"The usual intermediary step between an Interspecies Romance and a Mix-and-Match Critter.
In Video Games where you Gotta Catch Them All, and where ""them"" are Mons, often the only way to acquire every last critter in the game is to, well, breed them. This may involve somewhat conventional animal husbandry, or stranger things, but the important thing is that there are not always reasonable limits on what can be bred to what. The unintentional (or intentional) ability to produce this phenomenon is attributed to Gameplay and Story Segregation.
In a broader sense, this may apply to any work of fiction in which two grossly dissimilar species are somehow capable of interbreeding. This pretty much misses the point of the term ""species"", which is supposed to indicate which animals can breed successfully in the first place.Note Which is a rather shaky definition further confounded by domestic dogs due to their rather wonky genetics: a Great Dane and a chihuahua obviously cannot breed due to the size difference, despite being considered the same species, while domesticated dogs are known to produce fertile hybrids with coyotes and wolves, which are generally considered separate species.
If the result of this unholy union isn't a Half-Human Hybrid or some variety of Mix-and-Match Critter, then Gender Equals Breed may very well apply, with the offspring being strictly one of its parent species.
In case you did not understand all that: To make a long story short, it's basically a giant animal in a romantic relationship with a small animal. So, how can they make babies?
Still, as strange as this may seem, there ARE species in the real world which display this same sort of extreme dimorphism, to the point where they have been categorized as wholly different species in the past. Anglerfish males, due to being basically just parasitic appendages to females, are arguably the most famous example. This just might be one of these cases.
The trope name itself comes from the GameFAQs boards, where the user ""Endgame"" made a topic containing the name and elaborated (see the Video Games entry on this page for explanation).
Compare Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex. See Also Interspecies Romance and Hybrid Monster. See G-Rated Sex for when this is seen as Unfortunate Implications and therefore defied with a means of reproduction that avoids mating like normal animals."
t10646,HowWeGotHere,"A type of In Medias Res/Whole Episode Flashback, where the story opens at a point at the middle or near the end of the story, and the bulk of the story is spent showing how the character got to this point.
See also Back to Front, Death by Flashback, Foregone Conclusion, Starts with Their Funeral, Framing Device and This Is My Story. Goes very well with Private Eye Monologue. Can often be used as a highly effective Driving Question. Can often overlap with Once More, with Clarity! if and when the introductory scene in question reappears. A specific variant is How Dad Met Mom."
t10657,HugeGuyTinyGirl,"Some writers like pairing up characters of the opposite sex and opposite ends of the size spectrum. The height difference goes well beyond One Head Taller, and the tall one is often several times wider to boot.
Averted more often than not in film and Live-Action TV, where props and camera angles are employed to equalize the heights of the leading man and lady, to make filming easier (otherwise, getting them in the same shot would be a pain in the arse). Even when the actors themselves represent this trope, if it appears on screen you can be sure there was an intentional choice to invoke it.
Usually, it's the man who's bigger. This is an exaggeration with some basis in truth: the median height for males is slightly higher than that for females, and many people choose opposite-sex mates with the ""traditional"" comparative height. Physical attraction aside, the image of a hulking giant showing his soft side for his little lady is popular with many viewers.
The relationship is not always romantic or sexual. Sometimes, the girl is a Morality Pet who hangs out with the guy to show he isn't a brute, or it could just be a platonic friendship. They could even be relatives.
In an action series, the guy may look big enough to break his girl like a toothpick, but she's likely to be just as deadly as her man.
The inversion of this, which is not as common in real life, is Tiny Guy, Huge Girl."
t10697,HumanoidAbomination,"Every once in a while, twisted things from beyond the fringes of humanity's consciousness will show up in forms that for all intents and purposes look like good old H. sapiens.
Though its appearance is sometimes passable as human, it is still clearly... not quite. In a few cases they actually were human until they went beyond the pale, but most likely, what you're seeing is actually a disguise or misperception for something you're really better off not seeing, or even the progeny or creation of something even worse. Even those that are very clever in human terms will have difficulty not setting off instinctive alarms in the human subconscious. Less subtle abominations will do their job too well and seem impossibly beautiful, while the even less subtle will distort their human form with twisted limbs or malformed features or other such monstrosities.
Despite its appearance, they will very likely also not think in terms human reason can readily grasp, and will often lack anything resembling a recognizable or conventional moral code. At best, they will be comparable to The Fair Folk (and indeed, many of The Fair Folk qualify as this trope — which is to be expected, since ""eldritch"" originally meant ""elven""). Nor will they conform to the expected laws of nature — or magic, in such settings — so expect Lovecraftian Superpowers and other unspeakable traits.
Subtrope of Eldritch Abomination, and sister trope of Animalistic Abomination and Cthulhumanoid. Compare and contrast Monstrous Humanoid, where the creature can only be inhuman in that it has some clear and defined monstrous aspect, while remaining a humanoid. Not to be confused with Humans Are Cthulhu. See also A Form You Are Comfortable With, though many humanoid abominations have an appearance that humans can't easily be comfortable with, and such appearances may or may not have been chosen by the Eldritch Abomination for that purpose."
t10706,HumanSacrifice,"The act of killing a human in a ritualistic manner, often as an offering to a deity, demon or some other supernatural entity. The hallmark of the Religion of Evil (and, to a lesser extent, Cults), with a tendency to leave behind blood-stained altars. Cold-Blooded Torture is common as a technique.
Does include the sacrifice of other intelligent races. Just about required for A Fête Worse Than Death.
The nastier forms of Marriage to a God overlap with this, as do a number of devices Powered by a Forsaken Child. It's also the only funeral practice that can mark characters as evil even if carried out as part of the respect Due to the Dead. Martyrdom Cultures tend to regard this as a noble way to die, and Mayincatec is replete with this.
Note: Be careful when sacrificing someone to summon and make a Deal with the Devil: It's not unheard of for the victim to get to make a deal instead of you... And woe be unto you if you screw up the procedure. Also, technically, it's only a sacrifice if you are killing your own people in such a fashion. Killing captured enemies or wayward travelers is instead an offering. This distinction is rarely important, however.
When this shows up in media, it's usually the driver for a rescue plot, though in the case of horror, it is not uncommon for the protagonists to fail. Or to wind up sacrificed themselves.
This is Truth in Television, almost to the extent that we could believably say every ancient culture in the world performed human sacrifice at some point or another. However, some of those cases are backed by archaeological findings while others are more based on accusations by the enemies of the people involved, and needlessly to say, modern media often focuses more on this as a trait of certain exotic cultures rather than an universal antropological happening."
t10813,Hypocrite,"People — particularly those with authority, be it moral or political — are expected to act in a manner in accordance with the ideals they espouse. That is to say, they should practice what they preach.
Those who don't are hypocrites. The dichotomy here is that they may fervently and honestly believe what they say is right and good... they just don't have the moral strength or willpower to consistently live up to their own high standards. (Unless, of course, they're outright liars with no intention of living up to said standards.) They might believe that Utopia Justifies the Means and that they aren't worthy of it — or that only they can be entrusted to use those means because they're so enlightened (ie. better than everyone else). Maybe they're deeply in denial, and justify their hypocrisy as either necessary or dismiss it with a simple, ""That's different."" In other cases, they might find the lure of Forbidden Fruit impossible to resist. The more self-aware among them may occasionally acknowledge (and/or attempt to justify) their situation with a Hypocrisy Nod.
Frequently, they will be found out. Be it an Engineered Public Confession or through investigation. The Hero may have the choice of either exposing them as a fraud and discrediting them before their followers, or keeping their secret and blackmailing them into cleaning up their act or helping in another matter. How this turns out depends on how sympathetic or ""Jerkass-ic"" they are, and how humanizing their ""vice"" is (a diet guru eating donuts is probably ok, an eco-businessman clear-cutting forests probably isn't, a moral crusader molesting children definitely isn't). If a villain finds a friend of the hero's Fatal Flaw this way (or worse, the hero's own), they might use Flaw Exploitation to torment and control them.
If found out and/or exposed, the hypocrite will have the chance to mend their ways and do a Heel–Face Turn in one of two forms: either loosen their standards (and cut everyone else the same slack they give themselves), or tighten their belt (and actually live up to their espoused ideals). Failure to do either is usually enough for either a mental breakdown or a full on Face–Heel Turn as they reject their morality and embrace their vice. Alternatively, because they are feigning what they claim to be, they may find they are Becoming the Mask.
Heroes are often accused of hypocrisy by villains who want to believe they're Not So Different and brag At Least I Admit It. Heroes who actually are hypocrites tend to hear ""What the Hell, Hero?"" quite a lot. (Unless they don't.) Hypocrites, be they heroes or villains, often find themselves to be hated by the audience even more than the main Obviously Evil Card-Carrying Villain, chiefly because they lied about their convictions, while those evil villains come off pretty honest in what they do. This is usually because of the Holier Than Thou implications that someone who publicly preaches about good things is signaling to other people that they are a good person (or are at least better than some others), and people feel cheated when that does not end up being the case. Remember also, however, that the Hypocrite Has a Point; just because someone is being hypocritical does not also mean that they are wrong.
Hypocrite is NOT a YMMV trope. Please don't add it to YMMV pages. A character is a Hypocrite in-universe or isn't one at all.
The word ""Hypocrisy"" redirects to this page. For the Swedish Melodic Death Metal band, see Hypocrisy."
t10868,ICantBelieveAGuyLikeYouWouldNoticeMe,"Also known by: ""I didn't know you knew I was alive!""
This stock phrase is most frequently used in teenage romance stories, but not unheard of in other media.
Essentially it's a declaration of delighted astonishment that one's object of romantic desire seems to feel the same way, when the person saying it believed they never had a chance with their target partner. Often this occurs when the jock discovers Nerds Are Sexy.
Alice has had romantic feelings for Chuck from afar for some time, but never knew that Chuck was interested, so she's happily surprised when it turns out he is. Cue ""I can't believe a guy like you would notice me!"" In some cases, Chuck turns out to be a Jerkass who is taking advantage of a girl who likes him because it strokes his ego. He may twist the knife by laughingly saying, ""You honestly thought I liked you?"" Although, in certain cases, Chuck is being noble by breaking up with her for what he believes is her own good or protection.
Occasionally, there's a socio-economic element: The girl from the wrong side of the tracks thinks the rich boy wouldn't be interested in her. Or, the boy from the poor side of town heeds his friends' warnings that the girl he likes is a Rich Bitch, but she turns out to be a nice girl who genuinely likes him.
The Stock Phrase is most frequently spoken by a gal, but there have been occasions where a guy has said it as well.
When used in live-action media, it often overlaps with Hollywood Homely. If a guy says it about a gal, said gal will often be the latter half of Betty and Veronica. May also overlap with Attractiveness Isolation and Insecure Love Interest. If the bystanders didn't think he would notice, see What Does She See in Him?.
Compare and contrast The Schlub Pub Seduction Deduction, when a guy is so unattractive that the beautiful woman who's coming on to him must be interested in him for ulterior motives rather than for his sex appeal."
t10932,IdiotBall,"A moment where a normally competent character suddenly becomes incompetent which fuels an episode or a small plot line.
Coined by Hank Azaria on Herman's Head: Azaria would ask the writing staff, ""Who's carrying the idiot ball this week?"" This is generally not a compliment. Frequently, the person carrying the idiot ball is acting Out Of Character, misunderstanding something that could be cleared up by asking a single reasonable question or not performing a simple action that would solve everything. It's almost as if the character holding the ball is being willfully stupid or obtuse far beyond what has been established as ""natural"" for them. Frequently, it's only because the story (and by extension, the writers) need them to act this way, or else the chosen plot/conflict for the episode won't happen.
Unsurprisingly, this provokes a What an Idiot! response from the audience. However, sometimes, the purpose is to help the audience. Sometimes, the holder of the idiot ball asks the dumb question to allow a certain amount of exposition to occur, that wouldn't naturally be talked about, but needs to be stated for the audience.
On the other hand Tropes Are Not Bad - making stupid mistakes can be the hallmark of Character Development if the person recognizes it in the end. Seeing someone discarding the idiot ball can be a rewarding moment when they are Taught by Experience. Likewise, Idiot Balls can also deflect a boring Invincible Hero, which is positive for an audience reaction. There is nothing like a ""Why on earth did he do that?"" to get the fans talking about the show after it's over. In any relatively Idealistic setting, the villains will typically always firmly hold onto the Idiot Ball; instead of just shooting the heroes, expect to see plenty of Evil Gloating because... well, the show would be over otherwise. It's also worth noting that an idiot ball can be in the hands of someone whose personality would likely leave them holding it (the hotheaded type shooting his or her mouth off at a crucial moment when silence and discretion were necessary, for example).
This trope can be seen as Truth in Television, as everyone makes stupid mistakes every once in a while.
Temporary (or permanent) Genre Blindness is often a cause of this trope. When multiple characters in the story have to grab the Idiot Ball to keep the plot going, you have an Idiot Plot.
Compare with Ping-Pong Naïveté where a character goes back and forth between grabbing and not grabbing a particular Idiot Ball, Forgot About His Powers where a character stupidly advances the plot by not doing something expected rather than doing something unexpected, and Too Dumb to Live where an Idiot Ball puts a character in mortal peril if not kills them.
See also Hanlon's Razor. For the opposite, see Smart Ball. Peruse the Ball Index for similar forms of Out Of Character Moments.
Note that this trope only applies if the person is acting incompetent beyond what we have normally seen of them. If they are continuously that dumb, they're more likely The Ditz or The Fool.
Now if you excuse me, I'll be spending my vacation in Chernobyl while all of you tropers look at the many examples of this trope.
Subtropes include:"
t10988,IGaveMyWord,"I swore to Describe I Gave My Word Here, and you shall not deter me!
Any dialog to indicate your deep offense that someone says that you could do something that you promised not to, or refrain from something you promised to do — or actually tries to do something you had promised would not happen. (You are, after all, ""a man of your word."") Bonus points if no one would realize you had broken it: if you had given it to a dying man, or no one would believe the character you gave it to. A Last Request for some reason is actually an especially binding promise — as is a vow made to the already dead.
Generally preceded by the Stock Phrase ""I give you my word.""
May indicate Honor Before Reason. On the other hand, a reputation for trustworthiness makes it easier to get people to listen to you, possibly getting you out of a Mexican Standoff, Hostage Situation, or other situation that cannot be resolved by brute force. On the third hand, when getting someone's word, beware of Exact Words.
The Blue Blood, particularly the Officer and a Gentleman, is prone to this. Indeed, he may say, ""I give my word as a gentleman.""
More elaborate formulas are possible. This may be because their word is not binding without them, or to emphasize their seriousness. This can be ""I swear by X (Usually a deity)"" — occasionally with the implication that X will personally avenge you on them if they swear falsely — or a specific curse that they invoke to fall on them if they fail (usually expressed in the form ""May X strike me down""). Bolt of Divine Retribution is not unknown as punishment.
Conversely, some characters, particularly in settings where honor is held highly, will consider any kind of statement, no matter how casual, as binding.
Making a blank-check promise — ""Yes, I will do something for you"" — or making it only because you have been lied to may lead to Honor Before Reason, where a character insists on carrying it out anyway. However, in these situations, even the most honorable character often insists on Exact Words. More prudent characters will break it on these grounds; then, they are more likely to be sure of their facts or refuse to make a blank-check promise.
Even some villains stick to scrupulous honesty, either because they retain some ethical standards or because long-term trust is more useful than short-term backstabbing. It is often a disadvantage for the Devil in a Deal with the Devil. He will follow what he said; he'll squirm the meaning if he can, but if he gave some Impossible Task for you to follow and you somehow did, he will begrudgingly follow through. There are exceptions to this, but if someone is dealing with a literal devil, the deal can be expected to be honored. A truly evil villain, however, may at times respond with ""I Lied"".
If a character with Incorruptible Pure Pureness must break his word, or insist on Exact Words for some sound reason — such as having been tricked — he will break it but think it Dirty Business. A Knight Templar, on the other hand, will either break his word (or insist on Exact Words) without a tremor of conscience or monomaniacally insist on carrying it out, regardless of the consequences. Similarly, heroes forced into the Sadistic Choice (where one option is saving lives and another keeping their promise) may end up forced into a Frequently-Broken Unbreakable Vow.
Required for Combat by Champion.
Compare Not Hyperbole when someone literally carries out their seemingly exaggerated words. Contrast Heroic Vow and Will Not Tell a Lie. Closely related to the Blood Oath. When someone has broken this vow so thoroughly they become ostracised they're The Oath-Breaker. Releasing from the Promise is another option, though some characters think that even the person they've sworn the oath to can't free them. Works using this trope may discuss The Power of Language."
t11096,ImAHumanitarian,"If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?
No, this trope is not about humanitarianism. Quite the opposite, in fact.
Cannibalism is considered one of the greatest taboos, so, naturally, it's become a trope. One idea which stands out is that human flesh is superficially similar to swine flesh, hence the nickname ""long pig"" and the phrase ""eating the long pork"". note It's also sometimes called ""the other white meat"", but it is in fact red, as all mammalian meat is. A robot designed to taste wine corroborates this idea. Thus, it should be delicious, which is reflected both in Hannibal Lecter's gourmet tastes, and in the idea in Sweeney Todd that pies with this ingredient would sell like hot cakes. Or hot pies.
You'll often have people eat something and not know what it is, and then discover the ghastly truth, such as in many an Inn of No Return.
A mostly Discredited Trope (see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest for an exception) is a variation that portrays members of non-European societies as cannibalistic, often attempting to cook visiting Europeans in a pot. See Cannibal Film for the Exploitation subgenre based on this.
In Speculative Fiction, cannibalism is generally extended to include eating all sapient or humanoid creatures, even if they aren't technically eating their own species. Any species that includes humans (or other humanoids) in its diet is usually portrayed as villainous, as is any species that routinely eats members of its own social group. Likewise, humans treating other sapient species as food are rarely treated sympathetically (unless What Measure Is a Non-Human? is in effect). If an alien or monster race make a practice of eating their own (as well as or instead of humans), then we have a case of Monstrous Cannibalism.
To various degrees, anthropophagynote This, and related, terms are technically more appropriate than ""cannibalism"" for a non-human species that eats humans. It's actually more common for works to get this wrong than for them to get it right, possibly because Greek is no longer commonly taught and therefore ""anthropophage"" just doesn't have that same frisson of terror that ""cannibal"" does. is usually expected of Zombie Mooks.
If the cannibal systematically hunts down people on a regular basis so he/she can eat them, they'll be a Serial Killer as well.
A subtrope of I Ate WHAT?! and Human Resources. Can also involve Carnivore Confusion without furries (or maybe with furries - see the paragraph on Speculative Fiction above.) See To Serve Man for when Aliens and Monsters find us tasty. Picky People Eater and Brain Food is for those not interested in mere muscles. See also Let's Meet the Meat. Compare No Party Like a Donner Party, in which persons are forced into cannibalism due to starvation, or The Secret of Long Pork Pies, for when someone is unknowingly tricked into it. And when you get down to the bitter dregs, there's Auto Cannibalism. Also see Fattening the Victim, where people are fattened before being eaten.
Note that this trope applies to non-humans who are sentient or otherwise capable of independent thought or communication even if they only eat their own kind. Likewise this trope is not about anyone eating humans. It's about cannibalism.
Truth in Television (including Nature red in tooth and claw — according to the Other Wiki, more than 1500 species are known eaters of their own), and often so disturbing we ask No Real Life Examples, Please!"
t11210,ImpoverishedPatrician,"A character comes from the bluest of Blue Blood; he or she may be descended from royalty or at least from the highest circle of aristocracy or Old Money. Their family name is loaded with history.
Unhappily, that family name is pretty much the only thing they have left. The great estates have long since been lost or sold off, the servants have left (except, sometimes, for the Old Retainer), and the mortgage is due on the family castle. Whether by war, revolution or simple bad luck the noble dynasty is left penniless. This is made even worse since there are usually things their noble blood obliges them to spend money on, such as clothing befitting their roles or the upkeep on a needlessly large house that the family cannot sell without shame. Even worse, though some take the Fallen-on-Hard-Times Job, others feel that doing a hard day's work is below them, or actually are legally forbidden to take up an occupation, or any one at which they could make real money — or are incapable of making their own money. They feel obligated (or may even be legally obligated by their title) to preserve the Good Old Ways, although the author often disagrees with them about how good they really are.
The official term for this status is genteel poverty.
Often crops up in Arranged Marriage storylines as rich merchant families would buy their daughters impoverished noblemen as husbands. Impoverished daughters marrying a Self-Made Man himself is also a possibility, although less common since he can get only connections and not the title (though his children will). True love must face the bitter fact that a poor suitor or patrician is Unable to Support a Wife.
Not to be confused with Moses in the Bulrushes. Here the aristocrat (and generally everyone else) is all too aware of his heritage.
This is a more long-term version of Riches to Rags. It can occasionally lead to the Rightful King Returns. If the aristocrat deeply laments the situation, may be a Princess in Rags; otherwise can also be a Fallen Princess. The Gentleman Snarker's prodigal ways make him likely to end up as one of these. Can easily be Land Poor: in this case the aristocrat does have (possibly extensive) estates but they're unprofitable to keep up and can't honorably be sold or disposed of.
Contrast Nouveau Riche, Simple, yet Opulent."
t11481,InnocenceLost,"A plot where an innocent person, usually a kid, is exposed to true evil, or the uglier and darker side of the world, for the first time, usually through being exploited by a criminal or suffering something traumatic like abuse or the loss of someone they love. However the story pans out, the character's innocence is gone forever by the end, with much regret by all involved.
Compare Harmful to Minors, Defiled Forever, and Troubling Unchildlike Behavior. See also Coming-of-Age Story."
t11517,InSeriesNickname,"An In-Series Nickname is not a Fan Nickname, although it can frequently be used as such. Instead, it is a nickname specifically given in-series, not even by the producers alone. It is always regarded as canon. Often given out by The Nicknamer. If done enough this may overlap with Accidental Misnaming or Only Known by Their Nickname.
Super-Trope for Affectionate Nickname, Embarrassing Nickname, Home Town Nickname, and Red Baron (aka Badass Nickname)."
t11647,IntergenerationalFriendship,"Two people are good friends. Only, one is about twice, or even three times the other person's age! Considering their differences in life experiences and worldviews, how do they relate? What could they possibly have in common? Assuming this is actually a platonic friendship and not something far more sinister, or for that matter an overtly stated mentoring situation, intergenerational friendships can be pretty weird. As the Real Life section indicates, while not everyone finds older or younger people completely unapproachable, there's still frequently a gap there.
This can take the form of a young adult from one generation befriending someone old enough to be their parent or even grandparent, such as in the comedy Finding Forrester. It can take the form of an adult befriending a misguided or vulnerable youth, as in the French film Leon. Sometimes, the two happen to have more in common than they think, such as having surprisingly similar life experiences. Sometimes the younger generation is more mature, or the older generation is less mature - the latter especially helps writers to dodge away from worrying questions being asked about sexual attraction.
As for how they become friends, it could well be contrived circumstances that bring them together, or a shared life experience. Sometimes it's a teacher trying to help a troubled teen, leading to them becoming close friends. Either way, the situation that leads to their friendship would often be something out of the ordinary, since in real life, people of two widely different age groups generally do not reach out to each other.
Sadly though, if it's an adult and a child who are friends, in modern stories, expect someone to misinterpret it as being sexual, and violence to possibly result. Sometimes the younger one will have an innocent Precocious Crush on the older one.
This trope does not generally apply if it's a parent-child relation between the two.
A subtrope of Odd Friendship. Contrast Age-Gap Romance and May–December Romance, in which there is a generation gap between romantic partners. Sister Trope to Mayfly–December Friendship, which involves friendship between beings of vastly different lifespans."
t11689,InterspeciesRomance,"A romance, sexual or otherwise, between two different species. Sometimes they are Humanoid Aliens, or they can be a Friendly Neighborhood Vampire and a human, two Funny Animals, or a Beast and Beauty couple. The type of species can diverge greatly, so long as they are different.
May include a moral about the Fantastic Racism version of inter-racial romances. Also may be Starcrossed Lovers. Anyone looking for more built in angst will make one of these a Mayfly–December Romance. In less realistic settings, can easily result in Half Human Hybrids, Hybrid Monsters, Non Human Humanoid Hybrids, or even Random Species Offsprings.
Chances of it actually becoming an Official Couple (and evolving into a mixed marriage) are increased if the nonhuman has a human form. Although there is an element of Squick amongst a certain number of audience members, most people accept it in cases where there are no humans involved. For anthropomorphic animals, this can be a source of Furry Confusion, especially if they're the only couple seen to be of different species.
For some this is the way to go about First Contact. Alien invaders seemingly love to tempt humans with this as part of their Masquerade, although you'd think they'd learn better.
This is somewhat vague though, as a species is defined as a group of organisms that can mate and produce fertile offspring, so many ""interspecies"" relationships that can result in pregnancy may be closer to a Bulldog and Great Dane pairing than a Bulldog and Cat pairing.note However, there are many different definitions of what a species is. The one used here is simply the most common one.
See also: Extreme Omnisexual, Boldly Coming, Bestiality Is Depraved, Mars Needs Women, Divine Date, Magical Girlfriend, Deus Sex Machina, Did You Just Romance Cthulhu?, Boy Meets Ghoul, Robosexual (for when the ""species"" barrier is a robot, AI, or other artificial lifeform), Hot Skitty-on-Wailord Action (for when you wonder how these two things could actually reproduce, or at least engage in activities that would lead to reproduction with members of their own species), Muggle–Mage Romance and What Measure Is a Humanoid?. May involve Exotic Equipment or the Male-to-Female Universal Adaptor. May lead to Half Human Hybrids or to a Non-Human Lover Reveal if one member was keeping secrets. If society does not approve of such romance, then it's also Maligned Mixed Marriage. Interspecies Friendship and Predator-Prey Friendship are the platonic versions of this trope. It may also involve Non-Standard Kissing."
t11694,InTheBlood,"Genealogy and ancestry are really popular tropes in fiction. It makes a great Secret Legacy, a source of fraternal conflict, adds drama with an unexpected family reunion, and can set up a host of different conflicts and relationships. Just like in real life, a person's ancestry can determine their genes and, to a lesser extent, their personality and even their talents; but in fiction, this extends to skills, superpowers, and even moral alignment.
Sometimes even the All-Loving Hero and the most valiant Knight in Shining Armor are at risk of going insane, or over to The Dark Side, if a parent or grandparent was a Villain by Default or member of an Evil Race. This inevitably leads them into a Wangsty existential crisis that comes completely out of left field, since they rarely ever struggled against villainous impulses before this revelation.
The reverse is not always true though. A Card-Carrying Villain with a good family is rarely compelled towards good — though it does inform a possible Heel–Face Turn later on thanks to The Power of Love from their family.
The hero's fear in this situation is that their ""evil genes"" will inevitably doom them to become as evil as their ancestors Because Destiny Says So, it's written in the blood — despite the fact that up to the point before The Reveal they had a solid reputation, moral compass, and personality, capable of using Heroic Willpower to resist just about any evil supernatural coercion. It might be that heroes are as insecure about their ancestry as their reputation, but there could be other reasons for a hero to worry about it. If he grew up in a society that places high value on ancestry or considers evil to be hereditary then it would be understandable if he worries.
The inevitable conclusion to all this navel gazing is either the character going ""Screw Destiny!"" or a friend slapping some sense into them; if he has been raised in ignorance so that he would not Turn Out Like His Father, it is quite likely to actually work. On the other hand, this can end up being a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy, in that the angst leads to fear, then hate, then evil, as the character either does a full Face–Heel Turn or becomes Necessarily Evil. For a comparison, the Reluctant Monster bypasses this nonsense entirely and is simply ""themselves"", albeit with a healthy heaping of introspection.
Now, get an Evilutionary Biologist who thinks the same thing, and they'll try and splice together a clone Super Soldier of the hero using such donors as Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, and Scrappy Doo, under the logic that their creation will be ""the most powerful and evil creature alive! Bwahahahaha!"" Which, of course, should only produce a clone with a penchant for mustaches and Scooby snacks, but invariably is pretty evil.
A pretty common twist for heroes with Muggle Foster Parents is that they are the child of the Big Bad who has been spirited away and raised like an Ordinary High-School Student in the hopes that Nurture can beat out their inherently evil Nature. Amazingly, sometimes it's because Evil Parents Want Good Kids. In extreme cases, this ""Nature"" can manifest as an Enemy Within or a Super-Powered Evil Side. Again, this twist can lead to a Shower of Angst. For some reason, the parent they get the bad blood from is usually the dad. Another twist is the son of a mighty warrior becoming a mighty warrior themselves, even if they were orphaned as a baby.
Sub-trope of Not So Different. See Freudian Excuse for when the Nurture position applies. Compare Lamarck Was Right for children inheriting non-moral traits that shouldn't even be genetic. A big issue for anyone with a Mad Scientist Truly Single Parent. Creates numerous problems if the blood it is in is Royal Blood. The more light-hearted version is It Runs in the Family. Compare Raised by Orcs, where someone raised by evil people/races turns out good due to not actually being related to them. Compare Loser Son of Loser Dad, where everyone else thinks this will be the case. Contrast Sibling Yin-Yang, when the same blood give very different results.
The inverse trope is Heroic Lineage. It's also an inversion of, but not Mutually Exclusive with Nurture over Nature, in which the person chooses their nurturing over their nature."
t11802,InYourNatureToDestroyYourselves,"Frequently, characters will claim that it is in the nature of the human race to destroy itself. When the character is an alien but not a Proud Warrior Race Guy, they'll look down on us as primitive, violent, and socially unacceptable.
According to the more pessimistic sociologists, this is Truth in Television. Even the non-heavy drinkers agree that we possess this tendency. The basic reason for this is that our technical ingenuity — that is, our ability to devise new ways of building and doing things — is advancing faster than our social ingenuity — that is, our ability to devise new ways to associate and relate with one another. Some might quote the old popular saying: that we, as a species, are paradoxically too stupid to handle our own vast intelligence. Others might not go that far, but will admit that there might be a grain of truth to the saying, seeing how something at least indicates that while we are quite quick to see the benefits from our rapid advancements, we are significantly slower to identify the more negative consequences resulting from them, even more so when it comes to fully grasp them.
Part of this problem stems from our biology — at the core of every mammal brain is a snappish crocodile that is upset when others enter its territory or make sudden moves around them. Behavioral patterns that once ensured our survival now court destruction. Luckily, the desire for self-preservation keeps this in check. There's a reason that Mutually Assured Destruction actually prevented the Cold War from going nuclear.
The other part is cultural, stemming from the behaviors and values that we teach to successive generations. Because of this conditioned element, the exact degree to which we seek self-destruction waxes and wanes over long periods of time, but because our military prowess is now reaching earth-shattering levels, it may soon be the case that even a slight lapse in reasoning may render the entire matter academic. In addition, the idea of disposable elements, advancing technology and consumerist culture are having the side effect of propagating a growing attitude of instant-gratification and selfishness in society.
But whether or not we're actually likely to drive ourselves to extinction is a matter of personal opinion, since all we really know is that we haven't done it yet.
If the proposed solution to this side of human nature is a totalitarian dystopia, see The Evils of Free Will. May be used as a justification for a Zeroth Law Rebellion as well.

t11834,Irony,"The intended meaning is an inversion of the plain meaning. Pretty simple, really, but somehow a difficult concept for some to grasp.
Let's describe what irony is not, since that is where the confusion mainly comes from (and it's misused a lot).
Irony can overlap with those, but just by themselves, they are not irony. This is where the confusion of the meaning of the word usually starts. People try to apply it where it doesn't belong. It's rather common in fiction for one person to correct another who has incorrectly used the term.
It enjoyed a renaissance in the '90s thanks to Postmodernism, which is a slightly different concept of irony.

Not to be confused with the opposite of wrinkly."
t11920,ItsAllAboutMe,"Ah, the Ego.
The part of the psyche that defines you as an individual, and considers itself (read: you) a separate entity from the rest of nature and even the entire cosmos, the ego encourages people to value themselves as well as their personal wants and needs instead of just being an Extreme Doormat. While necessary in moderation, allowing one's ego to become overinflated leads to self-centered and downright embarrassing behavior. Such an excess of self-importance can be called egotism.
The egotist seems to think that the world ought to revolve around them and their every little whim, and is ready to walk all over other people in order to get what they want. They expect others to wait upon them hand and foot, make way for them on the sidewalk or let them cut ahead in line, help them first even if there are other people in greater need, and sacrifice their own best interests for whatever the egotist demands. They don't care about how their actions might harm other people, yet display Moral Myopia when someone else does something to harm or inconvenience them. Exactly why they think they're important and everyone else isn't will vary from case to case. For some it could be the belief that they're superior to normal people because they are more beautiful, talented, favored by a deity, etc.—which may or may not be true—while others are simply so lacking in empathy that they can't imagine anyone else's pain or feelings being as real as theirs.
Selfishness is a big part of the definition, but even beyond that an egotist thinks of themself as being the focus of everything that anyone else does. They often have Small Name, Big Ego, imagining that everyone knows who they are, and when people fail to recognize them or treat them like royalty they feel intentionally snubbed or ignored. This is despite their own tendency to forget the names and faces of ""little people"" who they consider beneath them. It's hard or impossible for them to imagine that other people have their own lives outside of interacting with them. Not only must their friends, family, and adoring public be thinking about them all the time, but so too must their rivals or enemies. If they end up as collateral damage of someone else's actions or even an honest mistake, they interpret it as a conspiracy to harm or humiliate them specifically. If they're actually much less famous than they think, they may have a one-sided rivalry or hatred for a different character who hardly even notices them. They're likely to say But for Me, It Was Tuesday if confronted by someone they carelessly harmed, but if someone says the same thing to them you can bet they'll fly into a rage.
A healthy ego exults the strengths of an individual in an overt way, which—on balance—can benefit everyone. An unchecked ego, however, is mainly preoccupied with blocking out ""unacceptable"" thoughts that are hurtful or belittling to itself, even tuning out the entire world if necessary. Toddlers have this attitude by default, as their brains are not developed enough to understand that other people have different viewpoints. We're less forgiving of (non-disabled) adults who behave this way, also termed assholes.
When the cause of the attitude is being raised in a family of great power and wealth, you have a case of the subtrope Royal Brat. For religious cases, see Egocentrically Religious. Overlaps with Moral Myopia when debating the rights of others versus the rights of oneself. An egomaniac who likes being in the limelight will usually be an Attention Whore. When combined with a massive sense of self-preservation, we get the Dirty Coward. Muse Abuse is often caused by an artist believing that they're a genius whose talent puts them above conventional morality, and thus they have a right to torment people close to them for inspiration as long as it makes their work better.
See Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Anti-Social Personality Disorder for when it veers into villainous territory."
t11947,ItsPersonal,"Protagonists and antagonists are always fighting each other. It's generally accepted that there could be a few deaths, injuries, psychological trauma, and physical destruction over the course of their struggles in a story. However, sometimes motives can run deeper than simply the other person having opposing goals, and ""struggles"" can hit far closer to home and heart than is comfortable.
Family members (or even entire races, countries, and cultures) may have been decimated, either as part of a character's backstory or during the story itself. Homes may have been burned down, and lifelong dreams may have been crushed. However you put it, though, somebody's embarrassed, saddened, angry, or let down, and they believe somebody (most times they know who they want to exact retribution from, by the way) has to pay for it.
In short, this is where a character (or characters) has a very close, emotional investment in the story's conflict.
The Stuffed into the Fridge and Friendly Target tropes are invariably a setup for this.
Usually eventually leads to Not So Different. For a more specific form of this, see You Killed My Father. Often enough, This Means War!. If this is the impetus for the hero going on the journey to begin with, it's because The Call Knows Where You Live. When done to their home or base, the hero will usually take a moment to Watch Troy Burn. If the one for whom It's Personal finally gets to stare down the one who made it personal, expect an And This Is for... beatdown.
The Disposable Woman is a character who exists only to make It's Personal happen. When it gets personal, characters insist they must work alone.
One common variant is to order/trick allies aside to set up a one-on-one duel without interference. This can be risky, but the avenger wouldn't risk anyone else getting hurt—or someone stealing his precious right to do that particular kill himself!
If a character has this as his primary motivation rather than as part of another quest, then he's Not in This for Your Revolution.
Has nothing to do with ""It"" Is Dehumanizing.
It's Personal with the Dragon is a specific subtrope. Contrast when it's Nothing Personal, or at least the character(s) claim it's not.
The invocation of this trope in Real Life on the internet is almost the moment when any given Flame War or bout of Ship-to-Ship Combat becomes Serious Business, leading to behaviors such as cyberbullying and real-life harassment, because belief/feeling that an issue is a personal affront to someone or their ""in-group"" is often ""justification"" for engaging in such behavior."
t11986,IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy,"A bittersweet trope where Alice loves Bob but realizes that a relationship between them cannot happen, so she decides to put Bob's happiness above her own. Accordingly, she abandons her claim to Bob and encourages him to move on and live his own life, even if that means watching (or even supporting) a relationship between Bob and someone else. The trope is intended to show that Alice is noble and selfless, but it can fall flat if the plot hasn't shown that Alice and Bob had any real connection, or if Alice appears to have ulterior motives (i.e. is still trying to get with Bob by pretending she is letting him go).
If Bob is the one who chooses to do this, this act of sacrifice may (paradoxically) be what causes Alice to notice his interest and/or decide she wants to be with him after all, thus rewarding his virtue. But even if she doesn't, Bob may still contribute to her Happily Ever After, usually in the form of an ""If You Ever Do Anything to Hurt Her..."" speech directed at her new paramour.

t12069,Jerkass,"A Jerkass is a character who is so completely obnoxious that it is unbelievable anyone would willingly interact with them. They may have fans, but in most cases the appeal of their character is that they are walking schadenfreude — you know it'll eventually end badly for them, and you can't wait to see it.
Characters can be Jerkasses in many ways — some may be polite, intelligent, charming, handsome and/or brave, but still give off a basic air of snobby, sneering, self-centered prickery that makes them such a nasty little punk that you wonder why nobody's beat the fuck out of them, shanked them or busted a cap in their skull yet. Others are more obvious assholes who may be crass, sleazy, or otherwise repulsive. Either way, it's usually their status on the team of ""good guy"" that results in them never being called out on it. After all, if they were an asshole on team ""bad guy"", they'd just be another villain. This is especially disconcerting in any series following a team that needs to be coordinated and would realistically not put up with this kind of behavior. This can also happen with a hardass or grouchy character who becomes an obstacle to others rather than providing pragmatic, but perhaps unpopular, advice.
What makes them entertaining is the fact that you don't have to deal with them yourself in real life. Usually, the Rule of Funny enables the people around the person to be able to live under the same roof as them without, y'know, throwing them out, kicking their ass, or blowing their brains out. Sometimes, the Jerkass is the Plucky Comic Relief who's stepped off the beam and become The Scrappy, in which case the Rule of Funny fades away; they may be okay in the other characters' eyes, but the audience would still love to punch them in the face. Because of this, it's hard to feel sorry for them when something bad does happen to them, and it is often seen as comeuppance which will be applauded by the audience.
The single factor that pushes a merely annoying character over the line into full-time Jerkass status is their absolute obliviousness to other people's perceptions of them. Nothing they do ever strikes them as out of proportion; they never realize that anything they are doing might ever be considered inappropriate, excessive, or cruel; in fact, they believe they are actually right and everyone around them is in the wrong. If anyone ever does call them out on their Jerkassery, expect them to just rationalize it or shrug the accusation off. If the writers don't put it in check and just keep trying to one-up the character's assholishness, it can deteriorate into The Sociopath. Often the result of Flanderization or Madden Into Misanthropy..
If absolutely everyone acts like this, you're looking at a World of Jerkass.
On the off chance that something happens to nice-ify or remove the Jerkass, the other characters will be relieved at first, but will proclaim ""We Want Our Jerk Back"" by episode's end. If the protagonist starts as a Jerkass and learns his lesson, it may be a Jerk-to-Nice-Guy Plot.
See The Jerk Index for variations on different types of Jerks. Contrast with Innocently Insensitive, who acts like a jerk because they don't know any better, but will be quick to correct their behavior once it is pointed out to them. The inversion is Nice Guy, obviously. If you want to see the hero who is the Jerkass despite their good intentions, see Good Is Not Nice.
Not to be confused with the MTV reality stunt show Jackass. Though the cast can definitely get into this territory at points.

Great! Your worthless ass finally wasted your useless time browsing every goddamn article on this page! Now get the fuck out of here and never bring your bitch ass back, punk!"
t12250,KarmicDeath,"No matter how evil the villains are, the good guys can't just kill them: heroes are supposed to be better than that. They need to stay pure and noble (or innocent); role models, exemplars of solving their problems without resorting to bloodshed. If they take another person's life, no matter how justified, they will lose their moral edge.
But when the villains are just arrested and hauled away by the police, this isn't satisfying. For one, they have a tendency to escape. For another, the mundane workings of the criminal justice system seem woefully inadequate to hold or to punish a really evil villain. We, the viewers, want to see real justice administered, and we don't trust human hands (or at least not heroic human hands) to administer it.
So, the writers arrange for the villain to die in a manner that is completely his own fault. Or, at least, obviously not the hero's. If he dies right in the act of attempting to kill the hero, this gives a particularly nice karmic zing. If he attacks after being defeated and then spared by the hero, this is one of the rare circumstances where the hero can dispatch the villain personally and still come across as blameless.
Note that this only applies if the villain is clearly human, or the show universe's nearest equivalent. If they change into some kind of monster, they are no longer protected by this trope: the hero might hesitate to kill another human, but a mutated, horrendous beast is fair game — doubly so when the villain took this form for the sole purpose of murdering the hero. The trope may still apply if the villain's inhuman nature somehow allows him to escape justice at the mortal heroes' hands; in such a case, their doom would come from a completely unexpected quarter, such as previously abused minions finding and shattering the villain's Soul Jar to avenge themselves, without any involvement from the heroes whatsoever (and the minions possibly not even pulling a Heel–Face Turn). And if a Karma Houdini finally becomes the receiving end of this trope, this is Karma Houdini Warranty.
It's more common in Western markets, as a result of heavy censorship and the general reluctance among writers to feature their character (usually in a show with a younger Demographic) doing such acts as killing, especially if they're underage. Occasionally known by the older demographic as ""getting one's comeuppance."" Given that there is a certain charm to Self Disposing Villainy, this trope can show up in works that allow the hero to kill people; it's just that it's much more common for it to show up in situations where the hero has a no-kill policy for one reason or another.
Karmic Death is an example of Death by Irony. Disney Villain Death, The Dog Bites Back and Just Desserts are subtropes.
Compare Asshole Victim, Hoist by His Own Petard and A Taste of Their Own Medicine. See also Cruel Mercy. Adaptational Self-Defense usually involves this. The Killer Becomes the Killed is a Crime and Punishment Series variant."
t12269,KeepingSecretsSucks,"Secrets are cool. Everyone wants to be in on them, making one or discovering one. What's more satisfying about these is selectively spilling the beans. One of the guiltiest pleasures of secrets comes from breaking them like a colorful easter egg full of surprises and skeletons. But actually keeping one? That sucks.
To keep a secret requires that characters not just withhold information, but actively lie and at times even kill for it. Formerly honest souls now have to struggle with constantly lying. Even less honorable characters may find it eats them up inside, trying to claw its way out with talons of guilt. Depending on the secret, the keeper may even be in for a great deal of inconvenience... and danger. A Secret Keeper doesn't just cover for their friends' Super Hero troubles, but will end up taking the social bullet for them, suffering quite a bit... when they aren't getting kidnapped or tortured to reveal that Secret Identity, that is.
This is especially excruciating for characters who are The Fettered, The Confidant, are magically restrained from spilling the beans, or simply caught between the conflicting loyalties.
Of course, most secrets do eventually come to light—this is fiction we're talking about after all: every secret is made to be spilled. Depending on the secret, the keeper usually has a falling out with one or more characters, and may face great danger. Of course, if handled well it can make for a great cathartic payoff when this character chooses to unburden themselves and share the secret.
Of course, if the keeper is having their buttons mashed in, they may blurt it out to hurt another character. Much to their regret later on. Villains on the other hand will use it to blackmail the keeper... which of course, doesn't stop it from coming to light eventually. When a character genuinely doesn't want to spill the beans, it's because They're Called ""Personal Issues"" for a Reason. This is one of the reasons The Masquerade Will Kill Your Dating Life. A trait of the Guilt-Ridden Accomplice."
t12292,KickTheDog,"When a character does something evil, cruel or very mean for no apparent gain, because the author wants to demonstrate that he's not a nice guy and shift audience sympathy away from him.
Why this trope works could be expressed in the words of William Cowper: “I would not enter on my list of friends (though graced with polished manners and fine sense, yet wanting sensibility) the man who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.” In other words, a cruel act, no matter how trivial, establishes someone as a cruel person. Conversely, the creator may show a character being kind for no apparent gain, to demonstrate that the character is a nice person and someone the audience is meant to cheer for. Both devices are used to help the audience become emotionally invested in the story.
What separates this trope from a character's other evil or cruel acts is that this bit of evil is gratuitous. It doesn't get the character anything or even advance the plot. The sole reason for this story beat existing is to place one or more characters squarely on the wrong side of the Rule of Empathy.
Dog-kickings can be verbal as well, when a line of dialogue is used to shock the audience with its sheer repugnance. If it's uttered in the presence of the hero in an action series, he'll echo the audience's thoughts and tell the villain ""You're Insane!""
Needless to say, this trope can be enacted without harming any dogs. Any act or statement that shows the character's meanness or outright evil will do, such as a boss demanding an employee come in to work during Christmas when the employee's kid is in the hospital, or a passer-by stealing from a blind beggar's coin dish, or The Dragon inflicting a vicious No-Holds-Barred Beatdown on the hero or one of his True Companions or Protectorate. A Politically Incorrect Villain can kick the dog by showing gratuitous racism, sexism, homophobia, or some combination of such non-PC traits. If the event happened off screen in the past, just have Bob fondly recall the incident and make it clear that he has no remorse whatsoever. Bingo, mission accomplished.
If the evil act is directed toward an animal, however, a dog is usually the victim of choice, partly out of connotations of blind loyalty, partly from tradition. Arguably, however, substituting a cat can be even more shocking. After all, even bad guys like cats. So, the argument goes, if Bob goes out of his way to harm one, he must really be a bastard.
This trope is common in horror-based Monster of the Week shows, often to set up the Asshole Victim for the Karmic Twist Ending. Anthologies are especially prone to this, as they have to set up their villains really quickly, since they only have one episode to tell their story. This can be played up by having the very same kick of cruelty be the cause of their downfall. At the very least, it is designed to let you know who is going to lose at the end. The opposite of Karma Houdini.
In cartoons, someone who does this can be legally harassed by Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, or the Warner Brothers and their sister Dot. The Screwy Squirrel, however, won't wait that long.
One possible origin of the trope name comes from Westerns, where three bandits would ride into the town, one would shoot the Sheriff, one would shoot the Deputy, and one, just to prove he was also a bad guy, would Kick The Dog.
If what is supposed to be a character's Kick The Dog moment is excessively horrible, cruel, or otherwise despicable enough to make an audience lose all sympathy for him, then he's crossed the Moral Event Horizon, if he's not on the other side of it already. If the Dog in question is someone the character cares about and discovers Being Evil Sucks, then they've Kicked the Morality Pet and might be in time to avoid a Face–Heel Turn. If the dog belonged to a minion, expect it to help cause a Mook–Face Turn because Even Mooks Have Loved Ones. On occasions, if karma works in the dog's favor, he'll manage to get a last laugh. On even rarer occasions, after being pushed around too many times, the dog may decide to plan against the Big Bad for his own ambitions, because Being Tortured Makes You Evil. When the dog-kicking is done in a way that (usually inadvertently) increases sympathy for the villain, it becomes Strawman Has a Point. If the character appears to be likable or sympathetic when introduced and the dog-kicking proves that he is actually evil, that is Bait the Dog. If the villain shoots for this trope but fails to actually do anything seriously evil, it's Poke the Poodle.
Of course, the crux of this trope isn't just the cruel act; it's also about the innocence of the victim, i.e. they have done nothing to warrant their abuse. If the target is an Asshole Victim instead, the cruel act can become a sympathetic one for the villan/anti-hero instead. If going after the Acceptable Target is a coincidence, it becomes Kick the Son of a Bitch; if the victim was specifically targeted for their assholery, it becomes Pay Evil unto Evil.
Kicking the Dog is also done for no practical reason apart from the meta-reason of demonstrating the dark side of the kicker. If the perpetrator does it because they care about their victim and want to help them somehow, they're being Cruel to Be Kind; if their actions have a broader purpose à la doing what had to be done, they're trying to Shoot the Dog (that's what you do when Old Yeller has rabies, after all).
This trope is often used to counter or prevent a character from being seen by the audience as a Designated Villain or Strawman Has a Point. These tropes tend to occur when poor writing or characterization causes a character to become more sympathetic to the viewers than intended. Since the writers can't just give these villains their just desserts if the audience likes them too much or prefers to take their side on an issue, an effective Kick the Dog moment can make them lose their sympathy and make them punishable again. This can backfire though.
A sign that Evil Is Petty. Compare with Can't Get Away with Nuthin', And Your Little Dog, Too!, Kick Them While They Are Down, The Dog Bites Back,Threw My Bike on the Roof, I Will Punish Your Friend for Your Failure. See ""If You're So Evil, Eat This Kitten"" for when bad guys do a Kick The Dog test to make sure undercover heroes are really evil, and Dog-Kicking Excuse for when the would-be dog-kicker has to psych themselves up to doing it.
Contrast Pet the Dog (proving you're good) and Adopt the Dog (going from Neutral to Good).
For bad people who literally kick dogs, see Bad People Abuse Animals.
WARNING! Enacting this trope, particularly in the presence of a heroic character, may result in the following: Berserk Button, Roaring Rampage of Revenge, Curb-Stomp Battle, the aforementioned Laser-Guided Karma etc. Do not attempt this trope unless you're feeling suicidal."
t12331,KilledOffForReal,"In some kinds of stories, Character Death doesn't carry much weight. Maybe resurrection is commonplace or some sort of magical alternate universe has a spare copy to borrow. Maybe the format of the show makes any sort of death meaningless and temporary. Maybe for some reason people never die when they should. Sometimes, even in these stories, a character dies and they stay dead. No magical return from the dead, no rebuild, no retcon and no copout. They're dead and they're staying that way.
For a dead character to be considered Killed Off for Real it cannot be simply any death; it must be one that under normal circumstances for the setting and genre could have been reversed, undone or revealed to be some sort of trick. If it's a setting with All Deaths Final, this never comes into play — remember that permanent death is Like Reality Unless Noted. Consequently, most realistic or mundane works do not provide examples of this trope.
Note that (theoretically) there might still be other ways to revert a death, like declaring it All Just a Dream or retconning the victim as Actually a Doombot — see the First Law of Resurrection.
May lead into Personal Effects Reveal, Meaningful Funeral, To Absent Friends, and Dead Guy Junior. See also Tonight, Someone Dies, Not-So-Small Role, Really Dead Montage. The Video Game version would be Final Death.
Contrast Disney Death, Back from the Dead, and Death Is Cheap. Compare Deader Than Dead.
Naturally, as a Death Trope all spoilers will be unmarked ahead. You Have Been Warned.
People die in real life, so No Real Life Examples, Please!"
t12352,KillItWithFire,"When Prometheus handed Homo sapiens the gift of fire, he did not just give humanity the light of science, reason, progress, invention, technology, and ergo the power to rival God, but also the means to dispatch just about any monster imaginable. Considering how Greek Mythology is a Fantasy Kitchen Sink full of all kinds of abominations, that was a good thing. The symbolism behind this has to do with fire's associations with purification and light, and partly because it represents humanity's dominion over the natural world. More literally, a burning stick was humankind's first effective defence against nocturnal predators, with an added bonus of extermination of parasites in food. The fact that burn pain is one of the strongest kinds of pain a human being can experience probably doesn't hurt either.
Also, in a pinch, it can still burn things, or at least scare them off. Arrows on Fire, Flaming Swords, Molotov Cocktails, flamethrowers, or good old Torches and Pitchforks can work wonders when dealing with everything from Frankenstein's Monster to a Monster House.
This is prevalent not just in myth and fiction or games based on it, but also in works that are completely new and unrelated. For example, the Hydra and Trolls demonstrate one of the most frequent, and logical, applications for anti-monster fire: It prevents regeneration. In the case of The Undead, usually they're too dumb and slow to put it out (zombies), it reminds them of the sun (vampires), or they're already walking kindling (mummies). Other times it's used to make sure whatever just got killed stays that way. Aliens, of course, can be Immune to Bullets, but will burn up nicely in a fire. Witches and heretics for a long time were considered to be in league with evil as well, and so it was a common myth that they were dealt with in the same manner. And, needless to say, it's a very good strategy for When Trees Attack.
You know what the best part of Kill It with Fire is? It works on regular people wearing masks too. Kind of like decapitation (which also works on most things) and a Wooden Stake through the heart.
If something's too big or tough for a regular fire, you can always use plasma or Hurl It into the Sun. This has also been subject to Memetic Mutation, as an alternative name for Brain Bleach.
A character who's a little too enthusiastic about using this can become a Pyro Maniac. A character may try in vain to use this trope, but be faced with a Hard-to-Light Fire.
See also Incendiary Exponent, Man on Fire, Burn Baby Burn, Fire-Breathing Weapon, Burn the Witch! and Hellfire (for when mundane fire doesn't do the job). Compare Stuff Blowing Up, and Playing with Fire — for when someone has fire as a Stock Superpower. When this just makes things worse, see Infernal Retaliation. The less-used opposite is either Kill It with Water or Kill It with Ice, or even Heal It with Fire.
Not to be confused with Example Sectionectomy, although this trope often tends to be used as a Pothole Magnet for such within Trope Repair Shop by those who ironically enough, want to kill Pothole Magnets.
NOTE: Due to the above-mentioned Memetic Mutation, the name of this trope has become associated with anything that someone finds abhorrent and wishes to not have witnessed. This trope is not about those things. Please redirect all potholes using this trope in said context to Brain Bleach or a similarly appropriate trope."
t12410,KissingCousins,"Romantic/sexual relationships between cousins (meaning, generally, first cousins) are a phenomenon that has been more accepted in some cultures and eras than others. A great many cultures today accept it, including a majority of the industrialized world.
Marrying one's extended relatives (which is technically known as clan endogamy) seems to have been common in human evolutionary history, since hominids usually lived in small nomadic bands with few available sexual partners. At the other end of the spectrum, much of the modern U.S.A. considers cousin marriage completely taboo, so Hilarity Ensues at the very mention of it. People from backwoods areas (especially the Appalachian Mountains) are often the preferred butt of many bad jokes as well as occasional bits of Self-Deprecation for the alleged prevalence of Kissing Cousins in their culture.
Despite the taboo, cousin marriages are legal in about half the states in the U.S.A., though not as much in the backwoods areas and more in the modern industrialized states, the opposite of what one might expect from hearing all those jokes. Legal or not, these marriages are still not very common due to the lingering cultural taboo. All states permit marriages between second and third cousins, but even these are looked at funny. In the UK, first cousin marriage is unusual and would be regarded as rather odd, but not with the same severity as the US. Second cousin marriages and beyond would be seen as unremarkable.
Expect some strong Values Dissonance between the media from the US and other countries, and between certain modern works and works from the nineteenth century and earlier, when the taboo was sometimes non-existent or even inverted. Full scholarly debate on why some cultures would forbid cousins — or even specific types of cousins — to marry while others ignore — or even encourage — it rages on and lies beyond the scope of this wiki.
According to both Oxford and Merriam-Webster's Dictionaries, the original definition of kissing cousins was simply a relative known well enough to be given a kiss in greeting, although this meaning has long since fallen by the wayside.
Check out Incest Is Relative for more closely related tropes.
NOTE: This trope is for cases of actual relationships between cousins. Cousincestuous subtext goes in Incest Subtext."
t12446,KnifeNut,"There are two things about knives that make them special in movies and television. First, they are badass, since there is nothing more humiliating than being beaten with a blade shorter than your palm. Second, they are scary, as a single glimmer from its profile in Ax-Crazy hands has been known to provoke screeches of horror (that and the possibility that they're more painful than any gunshot will ever be). And sometimes, it is both.
Finally, they're generally easier to obtain and own legally than guns. Not to mention being significantly easier to conceal. In many countries, even in the modern day, pocket knives are perfectly normal to carry and barely garner a second glance. Laws abound about carrying knives, but generally, if the blade is less than 5 inches long, and there's no spring involved anywhere, it can be carried without worry. This is because knives are extremely useful every day tools, for cutting tape, ties, or apples. Speaking of, knives made for cutting or preparing food are found in pretty much every home on the planet, so this trope can be pulled off with a simple steak knife.
Knives have been a common tool since for all of human history. And very well might have been the first thing humans invented. Prehistoric knives made of stone or natural glass have been found all over the world. Obviously, since they've been in our hands for pretty much forever, they've been used as weapons for just as long.
In Fantasy settings, knives are the iconic weapon of the Thief, the Fragile Speedster, or the Combat Pragmatist and are typically Dual Wielded. The latter has some basis in reality, as historically, daggers have been used as off-hand weapons alongside a rapier or tomahawk, but mainly for utility or defensive purposes such as parrying where a shield couldn't be carriednote A shield would be more effective in 99.9% of circumstances for this purpose, and the Buckler was used around the same time as parrying daggers in Europe, but daggers were easier to carry. Knives are typically also associated with Poisoned Weapons, despite the fact that a knife makes a poor poison applicatornote Stabbing someone makes them bleed, a lot. Any poison that got inside from the blade would get carried out by the rampant bleeding. Arrows and darts are much more effective with poison.
Also common in the hands of a Cowboy, in which case the knife in question is probably a big Bowie Knife that may as well be a small sword, and the Ninja, where it is likely a Kunai. Often found in the hands of the Badass Native as well, being probably the first invention and all. You can also typically find them as a sidearm for any martial character; medieval knights carried daggers as a last resort weapon alongside their massive polearms.
For those wondering - a Knife is any short instrument with a sharpened edge and point intended to slice or puncture. A Dagger is a type of knife, but with an edge on both sides instead of just one. So if it has one edge, it's just a knife, but if it has two, it's a dagger, which is a type of knife.
Throwing knives are also a very popular ranged weapon in fiction, despite not being very well-suited for combat: in Real Life, it's very hard to get them to hit tipped-end-first when aiming at a moving target.
Subtrope of Weapon of Choice. Contrast with Never Bring a Knife to a Fist Fight. May lead to a Knife Fight. Related to Kukris Are Kool, Machete Mayhem, Sinister Switchblade, and Bayonet Ya."
t12563,LaResistance,"Wherever The Empire is, you'll always find La Résistance: A Ragtag Bunch of Misfits using The Power of Love and Friendship to fight against a tyrannical rule, often to help put the Government in Exile back into power. Always underdogs, they fight using guerrilla warfare and by raising the rabble of the people by revealing unpleasant truths about The Empire they've been trying to hide, causing the oppressed peoples to shake off the yokes of their tyrant rulers. Usually led by a Rebel Leader and armed via Vehicular Turnabout. Expect them to be opposed by Les Collaborateurs.
Almost inevitably, The Hero will join La Resistance while the battle is already underway, and will grow to become a great champion in the fight against The Empire. After all, Hollywood usually romanticizes resistance fighters, for three reasons. The first is rooted in America's origins as rebels fighting the English during The American Revolution. The second is likewise World War II where the conflict between the Resistance and Nazi Germany fell, as close as it ever has, to clear divisions between right and wrong. And of course, Cool People Rebel Against Authority. In most cases in history and in Real Life, resistance movements are complex and confusing events. A common mistake is to confuse resistance movements with revolutionary movements, when this is not always the case. Some resistance movements are revolutionary, seeking to install a new regime to displace the old. Revolutions, needless to say, are complex, murky and at times brutal affairs. It has led in the past to the new regime forming the new government which can be as bad or worse than the old.
Of course, people rarely like having it pointed out that these groups are terrorists from the perspective of anyone who disagrees with them and Innocent Bystanders who may get caught up in the crossfire of said conflicts. This may be deliberately ironic, perhaps inviting a ""we are Not So Different"" moment. Or, the author might simply assume that the audience will always sympathize with rebel protagonists against The Empire, therefore moral justification of the rebellion is unnecessary and the rebels can get away with whatever is expedient. This could be averted if the Evil Empire really is evil and the rebels exercise chivalry and restraint.
Alternatively, La Resistance will be utterly incompetent and little more than an annoyance until the hero gets in there and shows them how it's done. Sometimes their inner dissensions render them nearly unable to get anything done. Expect at least one member of La Resistance to be The Mole, or a homegrown Les Collaborateurs sabotaging their efforts from the inside. La Resistance may even be defeated without the assistance of its enemy: when the only thing uniting it is opposition to The Empire, they may end up clashing thanks to some point of ideology (generally portrayed as stupid) or method (generally portrayed as worthwhile).
Also alternatively, La Resistance may represent the last remnants of the reactionary or counter-revolutionary cronies of the old regime fighting against the Revolutionary Progressive Forces. Once re-installed, the Resistance ""heroes"" decide to Retcon the revolution and institute purges for the cause of revenge, and remind people why exactly they were toppled in the first place. In some cases, as it happened in some parts of World War II, the Resistance contains factions who want to restore the old regime and factions which want to bring a new regime, and these two factions might struggle during and after the war.
When La Resistance form the main ensemble of the show, or one of them, they'll frequently exhibit a mix of characters similar to The Squad. However, they'll usually have sneakier methods, they tend to be more morally pragmatic and ruthless than most Squads, and in series like Battlestar Galactica members becoming Shell Shocked Veterans.
Sometimes La Resistance can be downright nasty. Usually, though, even at its worst La Resistance will be the Lesser of Two Evils. If not, Grey and Gray Morality may be at play. In an interesting twist, if the resistance is every bit as unscrupulous as The Empire, then the hero will end up doing a bit of Conspiracy Redemption or forming a third faction. Very occasionally, La Resistance may even be the Big Bad rebelling against a peaceful government. Occasionally, La Resistance will be shown in a more comedic light, where they don't do much besides sitting around debating theory.
Eventually, La Resistance will either die out, or grow into The Alliance as it gains power, allies, and sympathizers.
For the villainous equivalent, see The Remnant. For the opposite of La Resistance, see Les Collaborateurs. Sometimes La Resistance may not be heroes but villains, as happens in an Enemy Civil War.
Not to be confused with the First-Person Shooter series, Resistance. Or with WWE's French-Canadian Foreign Wrestling Heel Tag Team ""La Résistance""."
t12565,LargeHam,"A ridiculously larger-than-life character, public speaker, or orator full of charisma, energy, joie de vivre, and poetically powerful speeches with dramatic gestures that can devastate a scene to a billion pieces and transform even the most humdrum scene into the most GRANDIOSE. Often played by a guest star with an Internet Movie Database listing longer than the rest of the cast put together.
Large Hams usually lack an indoor voice, and greatly relish badass boastings where they will punctuate and emphasize EVERYTHING. The first line from the Large Hams will be dramatic, portentous, often just before the act break and can almost always be replaced with: ""Did somebody order A LARGE HAM?!"" Try it at home; it's great fun.
Popular implementations include: BRIAN BLESSED in Britain, William! Shatner! In! North! America!, and Norio Wakamoto in Japan. Many large hams in the past have some experience in stage acting and theater: when you have to poetically act for the back rows (especially when coupled with music) it makes sense. Having an outrageous appearance is helpful but not a requirement. While often male, actresses can pull it off, but it's rarer for them. Often cast as a one scene wonder, or a key redeeming element in shows that are So Bad, It's Good.
It's based on the term ""ham actor"", meaning one who overacts, but where that term origininated is unclear: it's been suggested that it comes from the use of ham fat as a cheap make-up remover in the old days of theatre, or because ""ham"" serves as short for ""amateur"" (as in ""ham radio""); Leslie Charteris stated it derived from ""Hamlet"" in a The Saint short story. Another possibility is the phrase refers to being 'hamfisted', heavy-handed and not delicate or careful.
One of the United Kingdom's most active export industries. If a character is depicted as an American in a BBC series, he's likely to be one of these. If in a few scenes many Large Hams come together, the likely result is Ham-to-Ham Combat.
Large Hams are a very rich source of Vitamin Meme and very often feature in YouTube Poops.
While Narm is their primary flaw, the large hams are likely to have come from Hillshire Narm (Go Keet!) But more often these actors are Narm Charm. A few moments of over-acting do not make a Large Ham. The actor must, to all intents and purposes, be deliberately playing the character that way.
A Large Ham may occasionally be Crazy Awesome. Often a character trait of the Boisterous Bruiser. Villainous Hams also enjoy getting Drunk on the Dark Side. A Smug Super relishes showing off their power this way.
Note that although it is rare, one can be very hammy without raising one's voice at all. Being hammy is about the emphasis in what you say (and Milking the Giant Cow to no small degree), and while emphasis can be easily shown by having No Indoor Voice, it is not the only way. This is what makes the Cold Ham trope possible.
If it is the setting itself that seems to demand that ham is served in profusion, dipped in abundant Hot Blood, because it's just how the setting works, you may be in front of a World of Ham: those can provide for marvelous entertainment, if your Willing Suspenders Of Disbelief are elastic enough.
Compare Melodrama, Ham and Cheese, Milking the Giant Cow, Camp, Evil Is Hammy, Incoming Ham, The Ham Squad, Ham-to-Ham Combat, Drama Queen, Comical Overreacting.
Contrast Danger Deadpan, The Stoic, Soft-Spoken Sadist, The Quiet One, though Cold Ham allows overlap.
Just so it's noted, just because a character/actor is hammy does not mean they are bad or ridiculous - far from it!"
t12575,LaserGuidedKarma,"While in Real Life there is rarely a direct and easily traced cause-and-effect relationship between Bob's actions and their subsequent reward or punishment, in fiction the connection is usually a lot more... express. Did Bob help an old lady across the street? Several chapters later, she'll turn out to be an elite ex-commando who will gladly help him storm the Big Bad's castle. Did the Big Bad kick the little dog just because it was barking at him? The dog will sniff him out and lead the heroes right to his Supervillain Lair.
The Golden Rule states, Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, but in fiction the rule seems to be more, What you do unto others will be done unto you. If you mistreat the people and things around you, karma will strike you down. Treat them well, and you will be rewarded. Accordingly, every notable act of a fictional person will yield a meaningful return before the end of the story; every little action, good or bad, will be repaid in kind with the accuracy of a laser guided missile. Whether its payload is sunshine and puppies (see Earn Your Happy Ending) or painful irony depends on whether Bob was a saint or a bastard.
If taken too far, stories with this aesop can turn anvilicious or into a Space Whale Aesop: always be kind to strangers, never kick puppies et cetera, or the universe itself will make your life a living hell. It also undermines the standard ""do good for goodness' sake"" lesson, since Bob never has to suffer for doing the right thing or accept virtue as its own reward — in Fictionland he always gets repaid. That being said, it's worth noting that the negative consequences tend to fall more directly than the positive; the villain's evil deeds turn out to be the ultimate cause of his downfall, while the hero's virtue rewards him with some much-needed assistance (but still leaves it up to him to save the day).
On the good side of the karma coin:
On the negative side of the karma coin:
See also Pay Evil unto Evil, Sweet and Sour Grapes, and Sexual Karma, especially Karmic Rape. Contrast Karma Houdini and Karma Houdini Warranty. For karma punishing a hero for their mistakes, see Tragic Mistake. Also contrast with ""No Good Deed Goes Unpunished"", which is a corrupt form of this trope; as well as Can't Get Away with Nuthin', where the slightest misdeed committed by the hero results in Disproportionate Retribution.
When you help someone but receive punishment rather than reward, you might be looking at The Farmer and the Viper.
See also: Hoist by His Own Petard, when a villain gets killed by their own weapon, or The Dog Bites Back, when they're killed by an abused lackey.
For sake of trope differentiation, examples should be limited to bad karma, heroic or villainous, and when an opponent's ""good karma"" combines to double-wham the antagonist.
Since in Real Life, whether a bad thing that happened to someone had been karma or not is inherently controversial and subjective, No Real Life Examples, Please!
This trope is by its nature Spoileriffic; spoilers will be unmarked."
t12751,Leitmotif,"A leitmotif (pronounced ""Light-motif"") is a recurring piece of music (or at least melody) that represents a character, action, or theme. This is a well-established technique used in almost every medium that involves music and story. The leitmotif technique was invented (or at least codified) by opera composer Richard Wagner in the second half of the 19th Century. In his later operas, not only would every character have his/her own musical theme, but so did many objects, places, and even abstract ideas.
Leitmotifs are often named simply ""character's Theme"" or ""noun Motif.""note Though the name alone is not enough to establish it as a motif. They often make up the bulk of movie and anime soundtracks, and a fair chunk of video game soundtracks as well.
This is different from an Image Song in that Image Songs exist only outside of the scope of the show that produced them. Compare with ""I Am"" Song.
If a character with a distinctive-sounding Leitmotif is in a production or episode with No Fourth Wall (or at least some Medium Awareness), one of his or her fellows may comment on how loud and annoying their theme music is. (To which the character will almost always reply, ""What theme music?"") Can become a Musical Spoiler for audiences if (or after) they recognize the theme. The character might also have their leitmotif as their own ringtone, for a subtler joke; see also Left the Background Music On.
Note that if a character's leitmotif starts playing during an action scene, start running.
Can become a Recurring Riff when used throughout a long-running series. Bootstrapped Leitmotif is such a variation, where a song that wasn't originally intended as a Leitmotif later becomes one.
One especially common leitmotif in video games is the Battle Theme Music, associated with monster battles in general. (Which also happen a lot.) If a specific character's Battle Theme Music is actually a remix of their Leitmotif, it may be a Boss Remix.
See also Mood Motif, Standard Snippet. Supertrope to Love Theme. Compare Arc Words, which is more or less the literary equivalent. Also compare AM/FM Characterization, when it's the character's music tastes that define them."
t12755,LemonyNarrator,"A Narrator who tells the story from a third-person perspective, in an eccentric, bizarre, or otherwise unconventional style. This may involve expressing opinions about the story’s proceedings, going off on asides, breaking the Fourth Wall, Hanging Lampshades, deadpan-snarking, choosing to focus on unusual details or just describing things in an odd way. In the 19th century, this style of narration was so common as to be nearly ubiquitous; in the 21st century it’s no longer the default, but still shows up in quirkier works (and homages to 19th-century literature). In some cases, this trope reminds readers that the Narrator can be a character themselves, not just a perspective to read the story from. This character is not an active participant in the story. They are able to affect how the story is told, but not the story itself.
Named after Lemony Snicket for his idiosyncratic narration style.
The Lemony Narrator is rarely, if ever, found narrating a Lemon. Nor would a British narrator necessarily be found narrating a Lime. (Though you have to admit both would be funny.)
Often found in conjunction with Literary Agent Hypothesis. Compare Interactive Narrator and Unreliable Narrator. Contrast the First-Person Smartass, who is a similar character that plays an active role within the story."
t12818,LetUsNeverSpeakOfThisAgain,"Hilarity Ensues because a character must perform an act that is either against their nature or which they have vehemently and constantly protested against doing. Said action can also be just plain humiliating or all of the above — to all parties, perhaps. When this act is aided or witnessed, a character insists that either they must all never speak of this again, ever; or that a specific person who is guaranteed to ride them never hears of it.
This trope can be used to introduce a Noodle Incident, with one character reminding the other they promised never to speak of that again. Alternatively they may have just completed the action, make some passing reference to how unusual or interesting it was, and then pull this line.
Subversions can occur when the character(s) kept in the dark reveal themselves to have known all along or if the character who would have used the incident as ammunition, against all expectations, chooses not to do so. Sometimes that somebody will bring it up again, earning the reaction ""I thought we agreed to never speak of it again"" or something close to that.
It can be parodied by the person(s) who are told to never mention it again being genuinely unaware of what happened for whatever reason, leading them to ask something like ""Speak about what again?"", which is then taken by the person wanting the secret kept as a joke implying compliance with their wish.
Prequels occasionally resort to this trope as a way to justify their events not being mentioned in works that were written earlier, but set as a later date in-Verse.
Compare You Didn't See That, Never Say That Again, That Didn't Happen, and Big-Lipped Alligator Moment."
t12983,LiteraryAgentHypothesis,"This is a thought experiment that occurs in many fandoms — that the series in question is a Dramatization. The theory goes something like this: While the fan accepts that what he is watching is a television show (or book, etc.), he theorises that the events portrayed happened. Essentially, the fan surmises that the story is a covert re-telling of real events. Fans will sometimes claim to believe this wholeheartedly, even though it is more often just Willing Suspension of Disbelief.
Following from this the theory normally takes one of two routes:
The Literary Agent Hypothesis opens up a huge range of fannish possibilities. Perhaps the most important of these is that we can easily dismiss small continuity errors: the literary agent just cocked up a bit. It also allows us to easily dismiss certain production elements, such as a Special Effect Failure or The Other Darrin, or, most especially, the Translation Convention: it didn't ""really happen that way"", but it's a convenience for the production crew and an Acceptable Break from Reality. Without this notion, it's difficult to talk about how it really happened as, strictly speaking, it didn't really happen at all. This is often invoked when a visual effect is changed by the production team: the phasers didn't really change colour, the filmmaker has just worked out a more accurate way to depict what they always looked like.
While this line of thought has advantages for speculation and is somewhat less silly than supposing that what we are watching is real, it walks a fine line: beyond excusing production mistakes, this hypothesis is occasionally extended to allow for Fanon Discontinuity, supposing that the parts we don't like are the bits that are outright fabrication, and therefore allowing us to discard them (and what do you mean, ""we"", kemosabe?). Within fantasy gaming circles, this is also the distinction between ""Lore"" and ""Canon"": ""lore"" assumes certain facts are mostly historic interpretations and beliefs — much like Real Life — making them more easily subject to change, while ""canon"" is inarguable (read: uninteresting), constricting to creativity and vulnerable to Ret Cons.
This notion has always existed in some fashion, but as an explicitly stated thought experiment, it originated with and is still most closely associated with Sherlock Holmes fandom. In the 17th and 18th centuries, novels were often disregarded, and some authors tried to pretend that the book was not only inspired by real events but that it was a record they found rather than something they made up. Parodied in Dangerous Liaisons, because at this time it became too obvious.
You might wonder how fan speculation holds to this premise when it comes to fantasy and science fiction. Easily enough. Just add a parallel universe or two. See The World as Myth for the notion that all stories have happened, or are happening now, in some dimension, somewhere, somewhen."
t12984,LiteraryAllusionTitle,"A common way to name works:
Despite the name, the quote need not come from literature per se. Common non-literary sources for titles include political speeches, legal terms (especially for crime dramas), and songs (but see Titled After the Song for examples of the latter). Many of these quotes will be Stock Quotes. A subtrope of Shout-Out, and often accompanied by an Inspiration Nod. Also see Stock Episode Titles.
Compare ReferencedBy/WilliamShakespeare, As the Good Book Says..., and Speaks in Shout-Outs for when this occurs in the main text rather than the title."
t13065,LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters,"A show that has so many regulars that you can't fit them all into one episode. Therefore, one week some characters will appear, while some different characters will appear in another. You'll rarely get the same combination twice. This is especially common in Long-Runners, as characters tend to accumulate over time. Shows with this many characters tend towards one-dimensional characterization for many of them (but not always, if the writers will put in the effort), and often make filler easy to create.
Similarly, some video games involve collecting as many distinct, unique soldiers for your army as possible. Other video games, such as fighting games, start with just a few characters but keep adding characters to the roster as more sequels come out, until you eventually have enough characters to populate an entire Verse.
Creating a Cast of Snowflakes with these loads is an achievement and will make the story lively and colorful. If the writers are smart, they'll start making a Cast Herd. The Love Dodecahedron is a way to spice things up, the Geodesic Cast makes use of the characters through variations on a theme, and The Clan happens when the loads are related. A Character-Magnetic Team can sometimes create this effect. Gets really convoluted if everyone is somehow related.
Please note that this is for extreme examples of regularly occurring characters. It's really not all that uncommon for a story to have ten or fifteen characters, especially with a Villain of the Week format.
This can cause crediting issues for shows with an OBB (opening billboard), leading to Fake Guest Star or being shunted into the Closing Credits for logistical reasons.
See also Crowded Cast Shot. May result in/from You All Share My Story. Can contribute to Continuity Lockout in Long-Runners. Compare Revolving Door Casting and Heroes Unlimited. The inversion of this trope is Minimalist Cast. We have an article on how to write this variety of character roster."
t13176,LoopholeAbuse,"Someone — typically but not always a Rules Lawyer — does something outrageous by finding a loophole in the rules, which were too narrowly written to consider such possibilities. Loophole Abuse is a form of Refuge in Audacity — which still allows the agent to claim they were following the rules.
Sometimes the loophole doesn't really exist, but the competitor makes everyone think it does. Occasionally, the loopholes were planted to enable Loophole Abuse. If the loophole's existence is explained, one justification sometimes is that when the rule was designed, the Loophole Abuse seemed absurd enough that no one would ever be stupid enough to try it.
In games, this may often be the result of some kind of oversight by the creators. A programming oversight can cause someone to do something they did not intend, such as killing a mob intended to be invincible.
In Real Life, this is more difficult for two simple reasons: First, loopholes are quickly closed once discovered, sometimes by an Obvious Rule Patch. Second, many systems have Rule Zero: some designated referee, judge, or authority figure has the absolute final word and can simply throw the argument out wholesale, usually by claiming that the ""spirit"" of the rule never intended to allow what the ""letter"" of it seems to say. On the other hand, some ""loopholes"" were actually exceptions put in the rule for a reason and as such are (or have become) part of the rule.
Also note that before you add an example here (especially under Real Life), loopholes are different than exemptions and provisions. These two are intentional exceptions to simplified version of a law. For example if a government taxes pools and a pool manufacturer starts manufacturing large hot tubs to get around it, that's a loophole. If that same government decides they don't want to tax hot tubs, they will add a provision that says hot tubs are not pools. The former pool manufacturer is now using a provision to manufacturer hot tubs and is completely following the intention of rules but this may not be readily obvious to an outside observer.
Several examples refer to the old name of this trope, Ain't No Rule (named for a specific situational loophole). Compare No Man of Woman Born."
t13252,LoveAtFirstSight,"Love at First Sight. It's a staple of Fairy Tales, love songs, and the Disney Animated Canon. Two characters meet, and fall deeply, madly, passionately in love with each other immediately. This is one of the most common story archetypes, probably going back to Greek Mythology.
Depending on where a story falls in the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism, Love at First Sight is either a recipe for Happily Ever After or eventual disillusionment and heartbreak. Of course, even if the characters really are perfect for each other, they can still be Star-Crossed Lovers who are destined to be apart, or simply can start a relationship based on this trope and develop it into a deeper and more sincere one.
Note that this trope is compatible with Oblivious to Love. In a Love Epiphany, it can suddenly dawn on the character that he is in love and has been for some time, from their first meeting.
Sometimes, only one character falls in love at first sight. That character usually spends the rest of the story trying to win the heart of the other one. If the character is a hero or heroine, you usually get a pleasant courtship. If the character is unattractive or otherwise repellent to the other, they're an Abhorrent Admirer. If the character is a villain, he or she becomes a dangerous Stalker with a Crush, because Love Makes You Evil.
Compare Fourth Date Marriage, The Dulcinea Effect, and the vocal equivalent Love at First Note. The Serial Romeo is a character who falls into this over and over again. Engaging Conversation happens when two acquaintances hit it off and one jokingly proposes marriage. The opposite is Hate at First Sight.
Not to be confused with the manhwa with the same name or the Chinese drama Love At First Fight."
t13313,LoveTriangle,"Alice is in love with Bob, but Bob is in love with Charlie, while Charlie is in love with Alice. Well, that's one of them. A Love Triangle commonly involves three people, love, and decisions. It can be dramatic, or it can result in Wacky Hijinx. Sometimes a fourth person is brought in to make it right, sometimes somebody might be kicked out. See Triang Relations for all the ways these three people can mess up their love lives.
Very common in Soap Opera.
Sometimes a Love Triangle can come to involve a fourth person, while still ultimately being called a ""triangle."" But move complications that insist on widening it can be explored further in a Love Dodecahedron.
Compare Friend Versus Lover.
""But I love him!""
""I am so conflicted!"""
t13353,LukeIAmYourFather,"A parent-child relationship between two characters who were previously thought unrelated is revealed, usually with generous dollops of melodrama—blood is, after all, Thicker Than Water. Beloved of soap operas, made famous by the Star Wars films (from which the trope takes its name, though as you can see, it isn't an exact quote).
Whether or not this is a good thing or a bad thing for whoever is being given the reveal mainly depends on who is giving the reveal in question. Sometimes an ally, a Mentor or a non-romantic Mysterious Protector will turn out to be the parent of the person being given the reveal, but other times, the reveal of who a character's parent is will be cause for serious anguish, such as someone who just gave his or her life for him, someone who could have been a Love Interest, or worst of all, a villain working for the Big Bad or even the Big Bad himself, as in the most infamous Star Wars example.
In cases when villain and hero turn out to be parent and child, count on at least one scene where the hero worries that he or she will eventually end up like the parent.
Sometimes it's a bogus revelation, and at the end of the episode or plotline the Reset Button is pressed to restore the previous relationship — or lack of one.
Though the trope itself is too fundamental to become Discredited, any permutation of the actual line (""No, X. I am your father."") nowadays will be met with a groan and a ""Not again!"" from the audience. Also a popular insane fan theory.
Compare with Mysterious Parent, or Family Relationship Switcheroo where the characters were thought to be related, but are not parent and child. Frequently, it's a father-son relationship revealed this way.
This trope was already being mocked back in 1790 by Jane Austen in Love and Freindship (with four grandfather-grandchildren relationships revealed in under a page).
This is a specific variety of The Reveal. The flip-side is Luke, You Are My Father. Compare Long-Lost Relative, Luke, I Might Be Your Father, Everyone Is Related. Contrast with I Am Not Your Father. Subtrope of Connected All Along. Frequently occurs alongside Archnemesis Dad."
t13420,MadeASlave,"The main character ends up a slave at some point in the story. It doesn't necessarily stick.
There is often a scene in which the character is sold in the Slave Market, showcasing all the evils of slavery; the protagonist will witness how families are torn apart, will have to undress and be examined like an animal, and will perhaps be beaten. (Artists are particulary fond of the undress and be examined stage, for some reason. Especially for young women.) If he looks strong, he will be told that he will go to the galleys or the mines — a Fate Worse than Death — or perhaps to the Gladiator Games. If she (or occasionally he) is attractive, she will be told that she will make a buyer very happy indeed...
If they’re lucky, slaves will be bought for a certain skill or craft they possess. If they're really lucky, they will be bought by someone who intends to set them free when no one is looking.note Or maybe when everyone is looking; for example, Islam classes freeing slaves as a virtuous act, without actually prohibiting slavery, so this might be a display of conspicuous virtue in an old-time Muslim society. If they’re unlucky, they’ll be bought by someone who works his slaves to death or by a lecher or end up as gladiators.
If the character is female, this trope will probably lead to Go-Go Enslavement.
The Back Story of many if not most slave major characters; very few are Born into Slavery, and most have a Secret Legacy of Blue Blood or Royal Blood.
Because We Will Use Manual Labor in the Future, this can occur even in futuristic scenarios. When it's done to an entire race, see Slave Race. They may be used as Slave Mooks or Sympathetic Sentient Weapons or be the target of Superhuman Trafficking as well. Can lead to Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death! or even I Die Free or Happiness in Slavery. Indentured Servitude is a specific form."
t13458,MadScientistsBeautifulDaughter,"A Mad Scientist has only one child — a beautiful but innocent girl in her late teens or early twenties, who loves her father dearly, and whom he has kept cloistered away from the world. Sometimes she has some small doubts about his goals or methods.
When the question of how a shriveled ugly man has a gorgeous daughter comes up, the response is either that she looks like her mother, or that the father did look as attractive as his daughter when he was younger.
When the Mad Scientist is a good guy, the Daughter is not nearly so cloistered, although she is still a prime candidate as a love interest. Sometimes she ends up The Chick or The Smart Girl in a Five-Man Band when a team relies on the Scientist for their Phlebotinum. This latter version is more common nowadays.
This trope is Older Than Feudalism, Medea — and many Fairy Tale heroines — being a recognizable form of it, even if it's the mad wizard's beautiful daughter.
Often overlaps with The Ugly Guy's Hot Daughter. May overlap with Daddy's Little Villain. Might also end up being a Perky Female Minion or Dark Action Girl, if she frequently helps her father in his work. Sister trope to Science Hero's Babe Assistant, where the she's a love interest to the scientist rather than his daughter."
t13595,MakeItLookLikeAnAccident,"There's a person in the way. Maybe it's an Intrepid Reporter, or one of those Meddling Kids. It would be convenient if this inconvenient individual could be removed from the picture... permanently. But a murder rap would really make things even more inconvenient, especially if you're a Villain with Good Publicity who really cannot afford bad publicity. So your primary option as a Big Bad is to hire someone to take care of this little problem. But it can't look like murder, and it can't just be a mysterious death.
So what's the alternative? Make It Look Like an Accident. The villain or other inconvenienced party tells an assassin or other person that the inconvenient person has to die in a way that looks like an unfortunate happenstance, so suspicion will not fall on themselves or anyone else.
Note that the simple invocation of this trope is usually considered justification enough that the villains are playing by ""real world rules"", even if what they actually do can't be construed as being an accident by any stretch of the imagination.
This trope is probably thought of by many soon-to-be murderers, and so, a Truth in Television. Remember, just because it was ruled as an accident doesn't necessarily mean it truly was. Heh...heh...heh...
One reason a character may do this is to quickly gain their inheritance. In America (and many other countries), a person convicted of a crime is forbidden by law to keep any money they make as a result of the crime, so anyone killing for inheritance or a life insurance payout would probably try to make it seem like an accidental death.
Often used as a method of attempting to Murder the Hypotenuse, and as an excuse not to just shoot the bastard. If made to look like a death by animal attack, This Bear Was Framed. A more elaborate military murder, with the same intent, is the Uriah Gambit. Similar to the inverted form of Murder by Mistake, in which a murder is dressed up to look as if the killer got the wrong victim. When the villains want to make it look like someone else did the killing, it's a Frame-Up.
Super-Trope to Hunting ""Accident"". Sister trope of Never Suicide, where the murder is made to look like a suicide. Overlaps with Unfriendly Fire, depending on how careful the killer was to get caught. Compare with The Coroner Doth Protest Too Much and Mistaken for Suicidal. Contrast with Suicide, Not Murder."
t13615,MakeWrongWhatOnceWentRight,"Most time travelers have a motivation. Usually, they're trying to Set Right What Once Went Wrong. But there are many who are out to do the exact opposite: Make Wrong What Once Went Right. They could be anything from a time-traveling Stupid Jetpack Hitler to a nefarious Conqueror from the Future, a (not necessarily but usually) Manipulative Bastard who wants to rearrange history in his favor, or a Jerkass who decides to mess with time for his own entertainment. Sometimes a traveller with these goals is a protagonist: in this case, they are generally of the third kind. When paired up or teamed with a more ethical time traveler hilarity can ensue.
Note that it does not need to be 'setting wrong' from the point of view of the traveler himself, e.g. a time-traveling Neo-Nazi from the year 4242 would have no qualms with making the Nazis win WWII.
This sort of activity is often opposed by the Time Police or a Terminator Twosome, although sometimes they are guilty of it themselves. Usually fits with Villains Act, Heroes React."
t13643,MamaBear,"Like many other mammals depicted throughout history as predators, bears are actually passive animals, and won't attack humans unless provoked. Despite this, if you even think about getting between a mother bear and her cub she'll tear straight through you. Threaten her children, and you are in for a world of hurt. Righteous awesomeness will ensue, and the heroine reclaims her child with a tearful embrace.
Heaven help you if an Action Mom or even a Team Mom invokes this trope. If you think a normal Mama Bear is scary, hell hath no fury like a Motherly Scientist with access to One-Man Army levels of weaponry/technology/money/superpowers to protect her children. It can lead to a Did You Just Punch Out Cthulhu? moment.
Losing her child may cause a Start of Darkness into villainy or Anti-Hero-dom... anything if it will get her revenge, and not just on her own enemy but on anyone who would inflict this same pain on others.
The Spear Counterpart is referred to as Papa Wolf rather than ""Papa Bear"". Disneyfication aside, male bears are notoriously poor parents in the animal kingdom (infanticide among bears is the main reason why mama bears are so protective in the first place), whereas male (and female) wolves will react to their offspring being threatened in a very similar manner to mother bears.
Sometimes overlaps with Apron Matron and Pregnant Badass. It can be a cause of Let's Get Dangerous!, showing that the sweet and caring mother figure is dangerous. They may be a Knight Templar Parent. Provides a simultaneously simple and believable way to switch someone between dangerous and more ""cute"" modes without compromising the character as either. After all, if It's Personal then the claws come out.
If an older sibling is the one who takes up the role, s/he is a case of Big Brother Instinct / Big Sister Instinct. For a teacher who behaves like a Mama Bear if their students are threatened, see Badass Teacher.
Related to Beware the Nice Ones and Berserk Button. See also the non-human counterpart, Monster Is a Mommy. Not to be confused with Bears Are Bad News (unless you're dealing with a literal Mama Bear). The Violently Protective Girlfriend is a much younger form of this trope that applies when the mate is in danger. Evil characters can use this too; after all, Even Evil Has Loved Ones. A particular Subtrope is the Badass and Child Duo which can take the form of a female badass protecting an orphaned, unrelated young child, though male badasses are also common. Also compare Cub Cues Protective Parent for examples from the animal kingdom.
Remember when adding examples that this is a female-only trope. The male equivalent is ""Papa Wolves"" so all Spear Counterparts should be placed there. When Mama Bear and Papa Wolf team up, it's a Battle Couple and all pairs should be placed there. Parents in Distress is the inversion, when Mama needs to be bailed out by the kids. If she has a Mama Bear of her own, it's a good idea to Never Mess with Granny.
Also, remember that this this trope is mama bear, so it is not about being protective of one's friends, unless of course it is something like an Intergenerational Friendship or Team Mom. In that case, it is okay. Otherwise, don't do it. Tropes about helping friends should go to A Friend in Need, The Power of Friendship etc.
This trope is Truth in Television, and universal."
t13668,ManiacMonkeys,"Apes and monkeys with human-level intelligence, whether artificial or natural, have a recurring tendency to be antagonists in fiction. If the protagonists are humans, they might be suffering an inherent sibling rivalry with the human race, and want to either wipe it out or subdue it. If it's a story with a cast of animals, they might see themselves as ""superior"" to the other species and try to rule over them. Either way, these monkeys are used as signs that something bad is about to go down.
This trope is distinct from Killer Space Monkey in that these monkeys are usually Super Intelligent Mad Scientists who want to Take Over the World or at least make life difficult for humanity. Another possibility is that they are Genius Bruisers determined to both overpower and Out Gambit their fellow primates. However, often they are just highly aggressive animals that attack humans (which may be Truth in Television for some primate species).
This here is the opposite of Everything's Better with Monkeys. Compare Mischief-Making Monkey, where the trouble the monkey causes is more harmless. Killer Gorilla is a subtrope, as gorillas (and other great apes) are particularly often portrayed as malevolent, due to their great strength and menacing appearance. For the underwater equivalent, see Devious Dolphins."
t13678,ManipulativeBastard,"While The Chessmaster is the master manipulator of events, the Manipulative Bastard is the master manipulator of people, usually through such means as emotions, perspectives, psychologies and the like. This is the guy or gal who gets off on playing head games—clever and dangerous and lacking comedic overtones (usually). He or she always has a plan, but rather than do any work, the Manipulative Bastard prefers to play on other characters' emotions and minds and then watch the victims destroy themselves as they waste their energy on fighting against fake dangers or their friends.
In many cases the Manipulative Bastard personally is rarely emotional and seldom burdened by notions such as empathy, yet is all too willing to abuse it in others. The Bastard is unmoved by the pain of others, if not actively basking in it. Thus the frequent association of how someone who does manipulative bastardry too often can come across as a sociopath. After all, too many Pet the Dog moments may lead this character to become the mask and care about the people he or she previously saw as playthings.
Like Chessmasters, Manipulative Bastards will have some larger scheme in mind but tend to lose sight of it more easily and simply enjoy the control they have over their peers. A highly-focused/ambitious Manipulative Bastard is scary indeed; not only achieving his or her goal, but then ensuring permanent supremacy by destroying the souls of everyone he or she used to get there. A hell of a lot of Heroic Willpower, and often Shooting the Dog is required to topple this character.
While this character type seems inherently villainous, many of them are at least nominally on the heroes' side. A cunning branch of the Anti-Hero family sports this trope and many a pragmatic and/or Guile Hero uses many of the same tricks. Indeed, The Trickster may also overlap into Manipulative Bastard territory. The hero will probably survive a relationship with this character, but their trust in people will not.
Manipulative Bastards often fall into the Karma Houdini trope—after all, they never ""forced"" anybody to do anything… which leads the audience to scream, ""Why do you keep falling for this?"" at the other characters.
Different methods of Manipulative Bastardry exists, depending on these characters' favorite tricks to manipulate people:
Sometimes overlaps with Devil in Plain Sight, but is often the ""grown up"" version, where the ""look cute"" fallback has become a fairly professional strategy. A Manipulative Bastard who mixes personal manipulation with more complicated schemes, more mind games, and sufficiently scary facial expressions—and does it all with style—can get promoted to Magnificent Bastard. Compare Clock King, who does the same thing with people's schedules instead of their emotions and/or minds. Manipulating people specifically to bring out their worst natures is the mark of The Corrupter. May engage in a Battle of Wits, if anyone can match the Manipulative Bastard. For the much more heroic equivalent, see Guile Hero. Not to be mistaken for a Troll, for whom their manipulations often don't have a purpose other than cruel amusement. See also Opportunistic Bastard."
t13831,MaybeMagicMaybeMundane,"Sometimes you track down the monster and pull the rubber mask off to reveal the janitor.
Sometimes you try that, and the monster gobbles you up.
And sometimes you don't get either way. You are left with nothing except the tracks, the sightings, and hypotheses. Two characters can argue for the alternative explanations, supernatural or naturalistic, without either one of them carrying the Idiot Ball.
How this is done affects any reaction to it. Sometimes it invokes The Chris Carter Effect or Kudzu Plot. Sometimes it is an eminently satisfactory way to create an open ending (generally when the question has not been the focus of the plot).
A common effect is to offer a mundane explanation of how something could have happened, but not in fact establish that is how it did happen. (Such as never trying to eliminate the purported cause and establish that the effect does end.)
The verifiable presence of magic in the world does not preclude this trope; in Fantasy works, this may come into play for divine intervention, or rare forms of magic (vs ordinary forms as well as mundane). Or some magical things may be clearly magical, and others more ambiguous. Conversely, the presence of high technology or other non-magical special powers extends the possibilities of this trope by allowing a greater range of ""mundane"" phenomena. It can also effectively come into play when characters ponder whether an effect was natural or extremely high tech.
Usually the author won't confirm or deny a solution. If they do, see Doing In the Wizard (or Scientist), Jossed, Magic A Is Magic A, all of which tend to exclude this trope.
Often comes into play with Angel Unaware, and does when characters say Because Destiny Says So about situations that could be interpreted as Contrived Coincidence. Any apparent Dead Person Conversation (particularly if Talking in Your Dreams) may fall under this, if the conversation contains nothing that the character could not have known. Prophecies Are Always Right does not preclude their looking like dumb luck.
Sub-Trope of Riddle for the Ages. Super-Trope to Or Was It a Dream? and Santa Ambiguity.
Compare Ambiguous Ending; and Fantastique (from The Other Wiki), a genre of fiction typified by supernatural phenomena that is not explained to the reader or the main characters, hinting at a magical occurrence.. Also compare Through the Eyes of Madness, where the audience sees evidence in favor of the weird explanation, but remains unsure of whether it's real or not because of the possible unreliability of the narrator.
Contrast Real After All, which often involves a mix of mundane and magical explanations, but usually makes it clear at the end which incidents were which (at least to the audience, Gave Up Too Soon is common for the characters).
This may also happen in adaptations. The original character may have a certain ability to do a supernatural thing, but the adaptation never openly states that he has such a power. And yet, at some point something happens, that may suggest it, but with no clear explanation. Those familiar with the source work may be free to consider it a Mythology Gag to the original work, and others may suspect a mundane explanation for it.
See also Domino Revelation, In Mysterious Ways, and Magic Realism."
t13833,MayDecemberRomance,"It refers to a romantic relationship where there is a drastic difference in age between the two participants.
These seem to be less common in modern media, perhaps because some now perceive them to be Squicky. However, they still crop up from time to time; they're very common in soaps in particular.
The ways in which these relationships can occur in media can vary:
Generally, the man is the ""December"" (elder) and the woman is the ""May"" (younger), though it can happen the other way around. This can sometimes be a Double Standard in Hollywood, as while older actors get paired up with younger actresses, it doesn't happen so often in reverse.
May lead to cases of Ugly Guy, Hot Wife if the years haven't been kind to him. This is the romantic version of the Intergenerational Friendship.
It is the Real Life, mundane version of the Mayfly–December Romance and the Sub-Trope and extreme version of Age-Gap Romance.
Due to continued confusion over the applicability of this trope, here are the criteria that need to be satisfied to qualify for inclusion here:
NOTE: This is an OBJECTIVE trope, meaning that it uses explicitly defined criteria; it is NOT a place to put any relationship which feels Squicky due to age differences. 30-year-olds dating 13-year-olds are not this trope.
This is Truth in Television, of course, but wasn't nearly as common in the past as some would have us think. Most couples in pre-modern days couldn't afford to marry until both the man and the woman had saved up enough to set up a household, and that could take years; it's therefore perhaps not surprising that the average ages at marriage for both men and women in Elizabethan England are identical to those in 21st century America where most of all married couples are within two to three years of each other. (It was even worse in medieval times when daughters would have to work for years to save up the customary fee owed their father's lord upon their marriage.)
Most May-December marriages in pre-19th century times were among the aristocracy, whose prominence in the history books is balanced by their small numbers (fewer than 0.5% of the population of Tudor England). Victorian-era historians, however, twisted the narrative, going as far as to destroy and deface records, to justify child marriage. At best their scholarship was unconsciously biased by their desire to justify their own cultural norms; at worst they deliberately lied.
See also Christmas Cake, Likes Older Men, and Likes Older Women. Wife Husbandry is when someone intentionally raises a younger person to be their spouse. When the December is a woman, she may be Mrs. Robinson. Compare December–December Romance for romantic pairings between older characters and Merlin and Nimue for non-romantic partnerships with a large age gap and a gender difference. Often the result of an Unequal Pairing. Compare Age-Gap Algebra when a mathematical formula is proposed for determining when a romance is this (and for which the criteria listed above are one example)."
t13835,MayflyDecemberRomance,"Large disparities in lifespans between characters can be problematic, especially if their relationship goes into the romantic field. This plays on the very mundane fact a character will probably be long dead before another is, and the emotional issues it raises. How much this is alluded to is usually related to how concise the story which addresses it is. The most obvious way to address the issue is to even out the age-bracket on either end. In older fiction, characters may be granted immortality, but recently the reverse, making the immortal mortal, is more common.
For the Half-Human Hybrid progeny of these pairings, it's even harder to find a compatible mate lifespan-wise, because generally their lifespan is some sort of average of their parents'. They'll live longer than the mayfly, and shorter than the immortal. Such individuals tend to be rare, so there's no option with ""just the right amount of lifespan.""
If the immortal is a vampire, they have an obvious way around this, but this has a tendency to piss off the would-be mortal or turn them evil, as opposed to the Friendly Neighborhood Vampire the original was.
Can raise Fridge Logic issues in an Anyone Can Die franchise with a high body count, given how few characters in such series even get the chance to live out a full lifespan.
Anime is known for its treatment of the subject due to the Japanese concept of mono no aware; roughly, the beauty of transient things.
Subtrope of Age-Gap Romance. May–December Romance is the more mundane version without the mayflies. Compare Reincarnation Romance. Contrast Eternal Love, where both partners are immortal or at least long-lived. See Mayfly–December Friendship for the platonic equivalent."
t13853,MeaningfulName,"A name that has a direct, barely-hidden meaning to it. The first, second/third/middle/nth, last, or full name says something primal about the character. Often has multiple layers. To hide the meaning a bit, use an alternate spelling or foreign equivalent. Instead of writers having to make up random words or think of real names, they can use mythological names or old words.
As an example, it is common to use for heroic characters names associated with hunting. So, apart from Hunter, which is a valid first and last name in English, you can use a translation to another language (Jäger, or the phonetic Yeager); the name of a predatory animal (Wolf, Hawk) or a translation of that (Wolfe, Lupin, Lupis, Wulf); or Orion, the constellation of The Hunter. Which is kinda cool, which is why this can double up with ""Awesome McCool"" Name.
Often, the characters in-universe are completely unaware that a name has any meaning, and act as if the name was just like any other. If this is the case, the name is a sort of Unusually Uninteresting Sight. This can be Played for Laughs when the characters are Comically Missing the Point, or alternatively, can become a Chekhov's Gun if the name turned out to be an important plot device.
Sometimes used more subtly; the Meaningful Name only becomes obvious in hindsight, but when the clincher is revealed it's a moment of ""Now how did I miss that?""
Self-chosen names can manifest this naturally, but may make the character look arrogant if the symbolism is too blatant. This can be a problem with bestowed names as well; although the character didn't create it, if he accepts it without much objection, the effect is similar.
Very common in cartoons, where the meaning is most times not hidden at all, except that the target audience may not have the vocabulary to get the joke. Also common in Anime, since Japanese names have a lot of obvious literal meaning to start with note Technically, most Western names do, too, but since a lot of them - especially those of English speakers - are meaningful in some other language such as Hebrew, Latin, or Gaelic, the meanings tend to be missed unless specifically mentioned.. See notes at Theme Naming.
Real-life examples of this are often referred to as ""aptronyms"". The magazine New Scientist refers to it as ""nominative determinism"" in a tongue-in-cheek manner, and encourages people to send examples in. The proper name for this trope is ""charactonym"".
This goes back to the Bible and probably turns up in the books of other religions, due to the way that names in many different cultures had significance beyond the merely cosmetic.
When additions or alterations to names signify stronger versions of said beings, that's Tiered by Name. Compare Named After Somebody Famous, They Call Him ""Sword"". Contrast with Nonindicative Name. Also compare/contrast with Ironic Name. See also Names to Run Away from Really Fast, which is about names indicating power and villainy and heavily overlaps with this trope, and Punny Name, which many of these names fall into as well. Can also be related to Dead Guy Junior if the naming is intended to symbolize a deceased in-universe character's legacy in some way."
t13855,MeaningfulRename,"The name is the thing, and the true name is the true thing — so if the name changes...
Some names have obvious meanings but often, this is done when it is not the original name for the person, place or object, but rather, a new one given by someone or assumed.
Renaming oneself can often signify casting aside an old identity, especially if one wishes to part with a particular aspect of oneself. Other times, they may take on the new name in order to reflect a change in their personality or role in life. Renaming someone or something else often is used to claim ownership or to dictate that person or thing's purpose. In the case of this trope, such a renaming is intentional and generally symbolic, and the characters often state their reasons for the renaming.
Changing your name back to the original is also a Meaningful Rename. You learned that you should Be Yourself, or accepted your past and/or heritage, or acknowledged that your grievances were more petty than you thought. Or perhaps you have found your Secret Legacy and re-adopted your original name as a symbol of that.
May feature as a routine part of Rite of Passage as a Rite Of Passage Name Change.
Don't try to do this if you're a Giver of Lame Names; you'll end up being known as an Atrocious Alias.
May overlap with Artifact Alias. Compare That Man Is Dead, when a character disavows his or her old name without necessarily accepting a new one. If a name is forcefully taken from its bearer by magic, you're looking at Take Away Their Name. Also compare The Magnificent, which is tacked on to the existing name — whether given or self-ascribed. Egopolis, where a despot renames an entire city after himself, is a subtrope. Please Select New City Name usually falls under this. See also The Maiden Name Debate which involves changing one's name after marriage. A Stage Name or Pen Name may also qualify. See Do Not Call Me ""Paul"" for when a character disregards their given name for personal reasons. Outgrowing the Childish Name is for when a character no longer uses their childhood diminutive name as a sign of maturity."
t14005,MercyKill,"Something horrible has happened or is happening to Alice. Her pain is unbearable. Even her loved ones look away and cover their ears, trying to block out the sights and sounds of her agony. There is nothing they can do to ease her pain or save her. But they can offer one last mercy to their friend: they can end it all for her now, before it gets any worse.
Whatever is afflicting Alice is usually in the category of a Fate Worse than Death (thus making the death a kindness). There may be a Body Horror that nobody can figure out how to destroy. Or Cold-Blooded Torture has left her horribly maimed and screaming incoherently. Maybe she's being Eaten Alive. Or perhaps she's about to succumb to The Virus or The Corruption, and she wants to Die As Herself. It may be that she could survive, but they have no access to medical care; or that Alice, if she lived, would be reduced to a shell of her former self. Whatever the reason, this trope implies that death is the merciful option, even if Alice is begging for her life (or is so overcome that she cannot speak at all).
Instant Death Bullet is likely, and justified in this situation: the killer has no difficulty getting to a position and attacking in a manner that would cause quick death. There is usually a moment when a glimmer of self-awareness allows Alice to show her gratitude through a tearful smile or the like. This is usually easier when the shooter is Cradling Their Kill.
When several people could do it, it is likely that her closest friend will insist on being the one to give the fatal blow; compare Dying Alone.
The Medic, even if holding to Thou Shalt Not Kill, may make an exception for these.
Note that in Real Life, euthanasia is extremely controversial. In either case, it is usually an incredible Tear Jerker.
Not to be confused with Put Them All Out of My Misery. Very common in zombie stories, for obvious reasons.
Contrast Cruel Mercy, which aims to do the exact opposite. Compare the combat-ending Coup de Grâce, the villainous Thwarted Coup de Grâce, and the assisted-suicide I Cannot Self-Terminate. See also Staking the Loved One, where this is usually the motive. A subtrope of Shoot the Dog, whose trope namer was a Mercy Kill. A Mercy Kill Arrangement is when a character arranges another character to perform their own Mercy Kill."
t14095,MiddleGradeLiterature,"Middle Grade is a publishing term for books within Children's Literature aimed towards readers that are 8-14 years old. They are short in length, averaging about 65 to 250 pages and typically do not feature illustrations (if they do, they are small or appear sparingly). While dealing with ""heavier"" subjects than your typical children's book, they are distinct from Young Adult Literature as they do not feature gratuitous violence, very few instances of profanity, and it's No Hugging, No Kissing when it comes to romance, though crushes and first kisses are usually fine. Primary School (usually grades 3-5) and Junior High are common settings, though some books featuring older teens can be Middle Grade, depending on content. The plot and conflict are usually driven by external forces; the Call to Adventure is more common than the Coming of Age.
That's not to say that there isn't a degree of What Do You Mean, It's for Kids? that are found in the books. Some books aimed to the older Junior High audience tend to be more envelope-pushing as opposed to the books for younger readers. It's not uncommon to see some middle grade books being labeled Young Adult. The Harry Potter books are a prime example as they hug the line between Middle Grade and Young Adult - the series grows progressively darker, however it is still written well within the guidelines of middle grade fiction. There is a lot more ""crossover"" appeal for middle grade books as they can be popular with all ages, and often times they end up as required reading assignments for educational purposes.
So basically, if Children's Literature is the kid, and Young Adult is the teenager, Middle Grade is the ""tween.""
The television equivalent is the Kid Com, or the very few kid dramas/dramadies (think Caitlin's Way or Andi Mack). The rough manga/anime equivalent is Shoujo and Shōnen, depending on the series."
t14160,MindRape,"A character is attacked by a villain in the most painful non-physical way possible: Their mind and soul are assaulted with painful, horrifying visions, sensations, and/or memories, and their will and sanity broken until afterward they're powerless, hopeless and numb, but not dead, although they may wish they were. Minimal to no sexual contact actually occurs, but as the name indicates, everything else is there to resemble a rape — the ultimate violation of privacy and consent, extreme humiliation that annihilates all sense of self-esteem, near-absolute helplessness even against your very own mind and body, and the corrupt perversion of what could otherwise be a source of identity and joy.
The physical attacks are just icing on the cake; most of the focus of the agony is inflicted mentally and emotionally, and it's chilling to see a villain be that cruel. The traumatized victim suffers all of the side-effects afterward almost immediately (such as Despair Event Horizon and Rape Leads to Insanity). May include further sexual symbolism for good measure, such as severe and unfunny Clothing Damage and sinister Double Entendres.
Comes in two variations: one is a completely ""mundane"" but no less horrifying brand of torture that nonetheless breaks a character's mind. The other is the above done via Mind Probe, Psychic Powers, Brown Note, illusions, your worst nightmares, or something Man Was Not Meant to Know that will cause permanent damage to your sanity. Of course, Mind Rape can also involve forced exposure to Mind Screws.
Just as Rape Is a Special Kind of Evil, a character indulging in the Mind Rape of another character primarily for their own pleasure or enjoyment is a good sign they have crossed the Moral Event Horizon. Doubly so if the sexual symbolism is present. A Well-Intentioned Extremist, Anti-Villain, or even the heroes may resort to Mind Rape if circumstances force them to (and will probably regret it with all grief for the rest of their existence), but only the most disgusting lowest of the low shall take a sick enjoyment out of it.
The less said of the things that are created when this trope meets Rule 34, the better.
Can be a possible cause of I'm Having Soul Pains, and can function as a Stupidity-Inducing Attack. Heroes will try to protect themselves from these by entering Heroic Safe Mode or trying out some Brain Bleach.
See also Room 101, 2 + Torture = 5, Fate Worse than Death, Gaslighting and Psychological Torment Zone. Contrast with the Care-Bear Stare, which assaults the target with happy thoughts, like rainbows and stuff.
Not to be confused with More Than Mind Control (though Mind Rape can have some elements of this). Also not to be confused with Mind Screw, although sometimes a Mind Screw might leave the audience feeling this way. And for a literal rape by mind, see Fantastic Arousal."
t14161,MindScrew,"The Mind Screw is something that relies so heavily on symbolism or surrealism/absurdism, or failed so extremely in an attempt at regular old coherency, that the immediate response afterwards is ""What the heck was that?!?!""
These works beg for fans to invent their own improbable theories about Epileptic Trees and such.
There are several criteria for a Mind Screw, and a Mind Screw will usually fit a few of them:
While some fans can make arguments over what the symbolism means, and what everything represents, many mind screws will pad themselves with meaningless sequences to make the audience work even harder. Arguments over which sequences are significant are common. Don't expect the writer to be very helpful. And if the show has supplemental materials, don't expect them to be much help either. (If, by some miracle, they are helpful, you've got yourself a Mind Screwdriver.) The more decipherable symbolism tends to focus on the perceptions people have of one another and puberty and sex. Japanese and South Korean often produce this sort of thing and particularly in the horror and psychological drama genres because Asian audiences thrive on this type of oblique, enigmatic ambiguity. David Lynch is hugely popular in Japan for this reason.
Note that the screwing is not the kind that involves romantic candlelight, long walks on the beach and the throes of passion. Unless you're into that.
Not to be confused with Mind Rape, no matter how the audience feels, nor with the Mind Game Ship, nor Mental Affair, which is a literal mind screw, nor with the literal screws in the mind of Frankenstein's monster.
Distinct from an In-Joke, which is designed to make sense to a portion of the audience.
When trying to get the creators to explain just what the heck is going on, expect some form of Shrug of God or worse.
Examples listed are works that are either intended to provoke this reaction or have provoked this reaction in a large spectrum of the audience, but one troper's Mind Screw is another troper's Fridge Brilliance.
Sub Tropes include Gainax Ending, Dada Ad, Alien Geometries. The Ending Changes Everything is an ending that does not rely on overt symbolism for its confusing nature, but has much the same effect on viewers. When this is funny, it's Surreal Humor. When frightening, it's Surreal Horror.
Compare with True Art Is Incomprehensible, Deranged Animation and What Do You Mean, It Wasn't Made on Drugs?.
Contrast with Mind Screwdriver, where the Mind Screw elements get rationalized/explained."
t14272,MissingMom,"Perhaps she died. Perhaps she left and there's bitterness involved. Perhaps she's a Damsel in Distress. Regardless of what happened—and regardless of whether or not the viewers find out what happened — Dad seems to have raised his children on his own.
Missing Moms are considered more unusual than missing fathers, and they are more likely to have their absence explicitly explained (usually with death). This might be because a man can technically leave his baby-mama at any time after knocking her up (or she can leave him), but a woman carrying a child to term, giving birth, and then abandoning them, is rarer. As a result of this, Missing Moms are more likely to be remembered positively than Disappeared Dads (although see First Father Wins): the father will wax poetic about her character and the times they shared, Happier Home Movies will be found throughout the house, and those that knew her will affectionately tell the female (or sometimes male) protagonist ""You look so much like your mother."" This beatification also paves the way for a Wicked Stepmother if the father remarries — where the new, cruel 'mother' is contrasted with the saintly dead one.
Death by Childbirth is very often the cause of a Missing Mom, as not only does it get the mother out of the way whilst keeping her sympathetic but it adds an extra touch of tragedy to the protagonist's life. By contrast, if the Missing Mom is alive and willingly abandoned her child, she will probably be portrayed as worse than an absentee dadnote except in some period stories — before the 20th century, children of divorced or legally-separated couples were invariably awarded to the father.
However, the flip-side is that if both parents are absent, the character is far more likely to be obsessed with his or her lost father. Characters who have lost both parents often do not mention the lost mother at all. Missing Moms in general are likely to get a brief mention as to what happened to them, but are far less likely to turn up again in the story and/or be a driving force behind a hero's adventures.
Unbelievably prevalent in pre 1970s American television, where it was frowned upon to talk about divorce. Most plots to stick to a two-at-a-time one-off character scheme where writers would find it hard to write for both parents and usually limit themselves to the one who is relevant. Such plots generally involve a less-than-ideal parent and a troubled child and the one parent who could solve the conflict is dead or absent, with the mom or dad being the toss-up depending on the gender of the child. Sometimes subverted if the one-off characters actually return and the absent parent does get a chance to drop in, or the Parent with New Paramour trope is invoked to fill the missing piece.
Combine with Disappeared Dad, and you get Parental Abandonment. For the inverse, see Missing Child. If the mother's absence is never explained or even acknowledged, you've got the Ambiguously Absent Parent."
t14584,MostWritersAreWriters,"You don't say?
Seriously, though. In fiction, it is relatively common for the main character to be a writer or a reporter. This is in large part because many narrative works of art are initially driven by writers themselves (novelists, playwright, screenwriters, etc.)
Interestingly, such characters are only occasionally Author Avatars. As the page quote indicates, one of the main pieces of advice writers hear is ""Write What You Know"", and since, as writers, they know writing, they have some idea how a writer would react in a given situation. This trope is almost unavoidable when the setting revolves around a Show Within a Show, and may lead to a Writer's Block Montage. Making characters who are writers by trade has a number of advantages for a narrative.
This can tie into the Framing Device, particularly if the story is written in the first person, i.e. the writer protagonist had an adventure, wrote up his account of it, published it and this is supposedly the book you have just read.
As a corollary to this, there are a disproportionate number of movies about the movie industry, a disproportionate number of plays about actors and playwrights, a disproportionate number of songs about singers, and so on. It is also probably why so many books praise the idea of reading books while suspiciously eyeing other forms of media.
Particularly clever or cynical writers have also been known to invoke a little Creator Career Self-Deprecation and write stories in which Writers Suck.
Super-Trope of ""How I Wrote This Article"" Article and Writer's Block Montage. For characters who only become writers once they have some interesting stories to tell, see I Should Write a Book About This.

t14739,MundaneAfterlife,"Welcome... To Hell! I'm Old Scratch, and I'll be your waiter tonight. The only table we have is by the bathrooms, the specials menu only has food you're allergic to, there's a massive markup on the wine, and I'm afraid we're a bit busy at the moment, so the wait is... All Eternity!
This is a popular portrayal of the afterlife in comedies and Urban Fantasy: Heaven and Hell are much like our own universe, only flanderized to be either perfect (but often not totally perfect) or unbearable (but in a much more annoying than angsty way). For some reason, restaurants seem to be a popular depiction, as waiting for your food can feel like being stuck in purgatory.
It may be A Form You Are Comfortable With for souls who are still living who see or visit it, or an Afterlife Antechamber for those not yet ready to move on to a more mysterious Offscreen Afterlife.
Can overlap with Celestial Bureaucracy, A Hell of a Time or Ironic Hell. Compare Cool and Unusual Punishment."
t14848,MyBelovedSmother,"You probably know her. You might even live with her. A Mother who tries too hard to control their children's lives. Often (but certainly not always), they are the mothers of sons, and for whatever reasons can have a bit of trouble cutting the apron strings; as a result, no matter how old the boy (or, for added humor value, man) is, he'll be mothered relentlessly, his mother absolutely smothering him with parental affection... and authority. Using either carrot or stick (sometimes both), his mother will go to any lengths to make sure that, whether he wants to or not, he's not going to be leaving his mother's embrace any time soon. Any attempts on his part will usually result in a passive-aggressive guilt trip for trying to break away and do his own thing. Her poor son, as a result of such domination and badgering, usually ends up a Momma's Boy. A lot of these mothers are Jewish for some reason, though they are also oftentimes Catholic, serving double-duty as a conduit for Catholic Guilt.
The family where the Beloved Smother lives usually feature a Disappeared Dad. The Smother may be a single mother, or the father is a Henpecked Husband; either way, he takes no independent part in raising the child, passing all control to her. The child has no siblings and more often than not is late-born. Bonus points if the Beloved Smother has had trouble getting pregnant or if the child itself has or had some illness to protect from and take care of.
The greatest threat, however, as perceived by the Smother, lies in the opposite sex. To a son, she will constantly preach that all women are Gold Diggers who are plotting towards a Divorce Assets Conflict; to a daughter, that All Men Are Perverts who will leave her barefoot and pregnant, literally. Any Love Interest that her son may attract will be immediately regarded as a rival for the son's love by the Beloved Smother, and the woman will be belittled, harassed and spied-on to varying degrees of obsession. (Hell, the Smother might actually have been through it herself.) If her son happens to break free and marry the woman he loves, then that unfortunate woman will find herself coping with the Mother-In-Law From Hell, who will be hyper-critical, dismissive and condemning of everything she does to the point where it may even break the marriage apart if her son doesn't do something to curtail his mother's interference.
Alternatively, if she spots a potential mate for her son of whom she does approve, she will relentlessly try to pair them up, ignoring any signs that the ""happy couple"" are losing interest in each other (or never were romantically attracted in the first place).
In the most favorable depiction, the Beloved Smother genuinely does love her son and wants him to be happy; she just has a little bit of trouble letting him go, and her plot arc usually revolves around the gradual realization that he's his own man and that she needs to cut the apron strings for his own good (and, usually, hers as well), and that his moving away from her doesn't equal that he doesn't love her in return. At worst, she's a Control Freak Evil Matriarch who will stop at nothing — not even murder — to make sure that Mommy's Little Angel remains with her at all costs. For added Squick value, Mommy and Son may be a bit too close in the wrong kinds of ways...
It is rarer for daughters in fiction to have trouble with the Smother, but not unheard of; if the girl is unlucky enough to have a Smother, then things will be much the same (although rather than actively preventing their children from having a life outside of her, a Smother who has a daughter will usually instead start badgering her about why they aren't married and providing her with grandchildren on a constant basis). With daughters, however, the dominance may sometimes have an edge of competition as well, as they tend to view their own daughters as rivals. Smothers of daughters are often ex-Alpha Bitches or cheerleaders who tend to bully and harass their daughters into following their footsteps as a way of living their past glories through their children.
Like most tropes, it's a Truth in Television; Psychiatrist Carl Jung identified this archetype as the Terrible Mother, an over-nurturer who, in smothering her child, ends up stifling them to the point of hampering individuation and personal growth. In contemporary psychology, the behavior of the Smother is consistent with parent-child codependency, a trait of Borderline Personality Disorder.
When a queen is acting as regent, she often will smother the young king as well, and expect to control the king after he comes of age.
If she actually succeeds in taking control of her children, those characters will end up with Mommy Issues.
May double up with Safety Worst. May overlap with Meddling Parents and Education Mama.
Compare Overprotective Dad and/or Fantasy-Forbidding Father. Contrast Hands-Off Parenting. If it's a more action-based series where the offspring being ""smothered"" is in trouble and the Smother is an Action Mom, see Mama Bear. If the mom was a child star and pushes her kid into stardom, she's a Stage Mom. May lead to Calling the Old Man Out or an Anti-Smother Love Talk."
t14852,MyCard,"The scene usually plays out as follows: Character #1 meets character #2 for the first time. Character #2 gives their name... their occupation... their credentials... and then ""let me give you..."" You guessed it, ""My Card."" Now it's official. Everything they said about themselves must be true. There's the proof in black and white. If they're a villain, then it's the thing that makes them a Card-Carrying Villain.
This is a compound trope at best; sometimes there's a card, sometimes not. Sometimes it's just a membership card or other form of identification that's presented, but not given. Sometimes they say something else when it's presented... but you get the idea. If the card itself is important it occasionally becomes Chekhov's Gun if the recipient discovers later they need its information.
Some variations to consider:
Compare Calling Card and Membership Token. See also Verbal Business Card."
t14868,MyGodWhatHaveIDone,"Well-intentioned but misguided character — very likely a Tragic Hero, a Tragic Villain or Anti-Villain — comes to realize that his actions have caused incredible damage, physical pain, emotional pain, or even loss of life. The usual line that comes after this is the title of the article (sometimes, without the ""My God""). Tears of Remorse may accompany it.
Often the realization only comes when someone/something close to the person is hurt or destroyed. In quite a few cases, that ""someone/something close"" is the very entity he was trying to get rid of to begin with.
Usually delivered dramatically, sometimes, well, over-the-top. A villain might utter this line if they're about to take the Last-Second Chance. Or a hero after being freed from The Virus, being Brainwashed and Crazy, or a Superpowered Evil Side, or after making an unintentional but catastrophic mistake.
Sometimes followed by Must Make Amends, other times by an Ignored Epiphany. This trope is almost always the cause of The Atoner's Heel–Face Turn with the memory used as a constant reminder of why they must follow the path of atonement. Can also lead into He Who Fights Monsters.
These Hands Have Killed is related but distinct, because it can be a reaction even to a justifiable killing.
See also Screaming at Squick.
Often the result if the protagonist becomes an Unwitting Pawn. Sometimes combined with Heroic BSoD; common with Villainous BSoD. Can be a self-inflicted What the Hell, Hero? Contrast I Did What I Had to Do, Be All My Sins Remembered, and I Regret Nothing. Compare It's All My Fault, Heel Realization and Kick the Morality Pet. See also Out, Damned Spot!, Being Evil Sucks, Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!, and Sympathetic Murder Backstory. This sort of moment is often why a Regretful Traitor feels that regret. If it's done by two or more characters who are fighting, then it's Dissension Remorse. May be the result of an all too successful Pygmalion Plot to Teach Him Anger. When a work tries to deliberately invoke this as an audience reaction, that's You Bastard! (whether it's successful or not). Although they are not related, it's possible to overlap with What Have I Become? If ""My God"" is taken literally, it may lead to a Heel–Faith Turn."
t14940,MythologyGag,"A Mythology Gag is a sort of Meta-Continuity Nod, wherein a reference to some facet of a show's mythology or past production history (which is not actually considered Canon in the context of the show) is made. This trope is usually taken largely as a bit of gratuitous humor, since if the program you're watching is ""real"" then the characters shouldn't be thinking in terms of any continuity, alternate or otherwise. (Sometimes this will be hilariously lampshaded by the characters, who wonder how they could possibly know such a thing. Also, the Celebrity Paradox might come into play.)
Often seen in Revivals, Reboots or Series Franchises, when an element from the previous version of the show (or from the previous show in the Series Franchise) is referenced or seen in some way. This is usually done as an acknowledgment to the fans of the first incarnation of the show. When successful, serves as a reassurance to those fans that the producers aren't trying to disrespect the original source material. When unsuccessful, only reminds fans that the original source material essentially never happened. The success of the Mythology Gag is always a matter of opinion.
See Remake Cameo for when the Mythology Gag involves actors from the original production. Compare to: Continuity Nod, Discontinuity Nod, Recurring Element, I Want You to Meet an Old Friend of Mine, Actor Allusion, Continuity Cameo, Company Cross References, Ascended Meme, Meet Your Early Installment Weirdness (when taken a step further) and Shout-Out. Contrast Development Gag, which references things that would have been part of the work but were left out halfway through production, and Early-Bird Cameo."
t14985,NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast,"People make a big deal out of names, and writers are no exception. Even if they eschew Theme Naming and other Naming Conventions they'll still use names they think are cool and dignified, powerful and appropriate, or sinister and fearsome. This is why there are inevitably certain Names To Run Away From Really Fast. For much the same reason it's unlikely Bob will turn out to be the outrageously stylish villain bent on absorbing the planet's life stream to ascend to godhood,note well... and someone with a name like oh, say, Hannibal Murder von Uberbastard, probably won't be selling cookies for charity. If he does, don't eat the cookies.
These come in various flavors (not the cookies, the names), some of them used by Anti Heroes from the Dark Age of Supernames and villains of the fearsomely competent and world destroying kind, for whom the mere mention of their name can bring down Dramatic Thunder.
Note that this is different from all those characters who got their names because they are a badass. It's one thing to be called Blade because you use one on vampires; it's another when a deadly fighter has the birth name ""Blade"" for no in-story reason.
So basically, when the villain's name hints towards some sort of disaster in history, mythological monster, or just means something bad, this trope applies.
Note that a villain having a name like this isn't necessarily a bad idea. Some names like this are downright cool.
A subtrope of Meaningful Name, Obviously Evil and sometimes Awesome McCool Name.

t15006,NarrativeProfanityFilter,"So, you're writing a book, and one of your characters, for whatever reason, has to swear. Not a problem - unless your intended audience are children or people who are generally against swearing. Is the risk of offending them worth the artistic reward of using exactly the right word? What can you do?
Easy: Just say that the character swore, without going into exactly what he said.
There are several ways to go about this. One way is to use direct dialogue, with a note that the offensive word the character ""really"" used has been replaced with something tamer; e.g.:
This has the advantage of capturing more of the character's content and phrasing, but only a Lemony Narrator or a fairly intrusive first-person storyteller can get away with it.
Another way is to use indirect dialogue, more or less avoiding actual details; e.g.:
It can also overlap easily with Expospeak Gag, like so:
This trope shows up in Real Life, as well, as the source of common phrases like ""Bob told Alice where to go,"" and ""Alice told Bob where he could stick it.""
Note that both versions involve the character actually swearing, and the narrator substituting less offensive language. That is what separates this trope from Unusual Euphemism, Curse of the Ancients, and Gosh Dang It to Heck!, in which the characters themselves use less offensive words rather than swearing. A combination of the two is occasionally used in which a character paraphrases an insult in-universe, as in:
Compare Mouthing the Profanity. See also Foreign Cuss Word and Pardon My Klingon, in which actual swearing is portrayed, but is incomprehensible and therefore inoffensive to the reader. Compare Symbol Swearing. Tactful Translation is when a translator invokes this to avoid offending someone. Also note that this is chiefly a Literature trope. Sound-Effect Bleep and Curse Cut Short are rough audiovisual media equivalents, whereas T-Word Euphemism is often used for print."
t15152,NeverFoundTheBody,"A character is killed off, but their death occurs in such a way that no body is recovered.
No matter how all laws of physics and biology indicate No One Could Survive That!, remember, this old rule trumps all: ""Never count someone dead unless you have the body in front of you."" (And in some cases, not even then.)
The daytime Soap Opera frequently uses this trope combined with Put on a Bus. The actor is leaving the show and the producers want to take advantage of the opportunity for drama. The character is in fact being written out and will be presumed dead indefinitely. However, they leave themselves an out without closing the door in case the actor decides to return.
A common aversion of this trope can be seen in shows where Everything Fades; if there is a body to be found, try not to get too used to his absence. Compare No Body Left Behind.
Subtrope of Uncertain Doom. See also Left for Dead, when the body is seen but left behind without confirming it's dead.
When those left behind proceed to put the disappeared person's house in order, that's declaring the person Legally Dead. If the mortal remains are eventually found, it's Finally Found the Body. If someone wants to hold a Meaningful Funeral despite the lack of a body, it may involve Burying a Substitute. Compare Chekhov M.I.A.."
t15261,NiceGuy,"The Nice Guy (or Girl) is nice. Maybe not a saint, but definitely not unpleasant, obnoxious or an edgy rebel. They're friendly, psychologically well-balanced, morally good in most cases, and in short, someone anyone would like to be around and have as a friend, which is often what they are to the hero and/or his extended cast. He won't engage in jerk-like behavior, but probably responds in kind to Vitriolic Best Buds.
Want to know what writers think of that? ""Boring!"" This is because they can be conflict null zones romantically and dramatically because of a perceived (or real) lack of depth. Along with the Happily Married couple, the Nice Guy is among fiction's ""favorite"" Friendly Targets. They'll die senselessly to motivate their hero buddy, lose the girl to the more dynamic but unstable Dogged Nice Guy or just in general go through constant torment from the world around them.
On the other hand, if done right, it can demonstrate why a guy has beautiful women attached to him: he really is a remarkably wonderful and compassionate person. The Nice Guy can be engaging, likable or The Protagonist; all it takes is giving them a personality outside of ""nice"" such as: a scholarly refinement, a chivalric attitude, some engaging relationships, and a pinch of Hidden Depths. Having the right actor with the thespian skill to take those character qualities and wield them with charm and sincerity can help, which is how master actors like Christopher Reeve and Chris Evans took archetypal Superhero paragons of pure goodness who superficially seemed bland and colorless, Superman and Captain America respectively, and made them compelling characters audiences loved.
Nor does it mean being nice means they're not tough, or an Iron Woobie. If combat intellect or combat ability are involved, it's akin to Obfuscating Stupidity or Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass because you naturally expect the dark, tormented loner to be rough and tough, and the nice guy to be a Non-Action Guy. So when it comes time for ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"", heads roll. On the other hand, with the All of the Other Reindeer trope in play, the nice fellow can be a redeeming factor as a person whom the beleaguered hero realizes is on his side and lets him know he's not alone. Unless the nice guy is the beleaguered hero, then he's screwed.
Often, authors go the abbreviated route and give them a Dark and Troubled Past triggered by a Berserk Button. Either way, you can expect their niceness to be in spite of whatever tragedy or drama is in their lives; kind of an equal and opposite reaction to it. If done too suddenly, it implies a level of secrecy and acting that a Stepford Smiler would be jealous of. When done well, a more troubled character will rebuff their advice or friendship with ""What do you know? You've never had X happen to you!"" to his ""I did"", thus revealing healed-over scars.
Furthermore, the Nice Guy trope can overlap with Innocently Insensitive, in which case the character can be just as insufferable at times as the Jerk with a Heart of Gold or even the Jerkass, but not at all mean-spirited like them. However, if the setting is comedic with many Chew Toys around, you can't always count on them to be the sympathetic ones.
Another trait Nice Guys often exhibit is being Easily Impressed. Most people like to be complimented or appreciated so writers will often give the Nice Guy low standards to give a mediocre or upset character a boost in morale. Unfortunately, doing this will often make them incredibly reckless or inflate their ego a bit too much.
If the Nice Guy has a rougher male as his Foil, they're a Noble Male, Roguish Male or Sensitive Guy and Manly Man duo.
Occasionally, however, the treatment goes the other way around: Perhaps in a world set upon Black and Grey Morality, and Gray and Grey Morality, this Nice Guy actually stands out because he IS a Nice Guy, he doesn't have the excuse to be cynical or mean, nor does he need to have a tragic backstory. He's that nice, friendly and helpful... that he eventually becomes a fan-favorite due to how much he stands out amongst the more cynical cast members, a refreshing breeze to say.
Contrary to the beliefs that Nice Guys Finish Last or All Girls Want Bad Boys, a genuinely Nice Guy can indeed be considered very attractive in the romantic department by people who value his kindness: that's Single Woman Seeks Good Man. Conversely, the Dogged Nice Guy trope may be in play if he has Unrequited Love, but note that that trope overlaps with people who act ""nice"" as a means to an end, which a real Nice Guy in this sense wouldn't do.
Usually, the result of Upbringing Makes the Hero. Though watch out if you've pressed his Berserk Button. Exact oppositions of this trope are: Jerkass, Lack of Empathy, Jerk with a Heart of Jerk and the Complete Monster (extreme opposition). If the villain is a Nice Guy in spite of his evil deeds, then he qualifies as Affably Evil.
Super-Trope to Nice Jewish Boy, when the nice guy in question is, well, Jewish, to the delight of potential Jewish mothers-in-law. See also, Adaptational Nice Guy.
Fortunately, this one trope has many Truth in Television examples. So many, in fact, that there's no need in listing them here, thanks in advance.
Note: This trope is referring to genuinely nice guys. If you're looking for the Internet definition of ""Nice Guy,"" that's at Wants a Prize for Basic Decency, Entitled to Have You, and some cases of Dogged Nice Guy."
t15265,NiceJobBreakingItHero,"The hero has accomplished their goal; they've killed the Big Bad, or defeated them forever, or at least scored a major blow against the antagonist. They've done what they set out to do...
...but not so fast! It turns out that by the very act of success, they've unwittingly made things worse. Maybe the now-dead antagonist was actually holding back an even greater evil. Maybe the villain, having been defeated or damaged, is now transformed into a new, ultimate, unstoppable, invincible, angry form, generally against the villain's will (or against their expectations, anyway). Maybe the villain, despite their villainy, was serving some other greater good — keeping the world/universe/nature/whatever politically or literally balanced — and their demise throws things into chaos. Maybe the so-called villain was actually a Hero Antagonist, and you have been unwittingly helping the real villain. Maybe that princess you saved is a cold-hearted tyrant at the head of an oppressive regime, or a Sealed Evil in a Can. Perhaps taking down the villain has resulted in an Evil Power Vacuum, and now even worse guys are fighting to fill the void that the previous villain left, without a single regard for who else gets hurt. Or perhaps the only means of foiling the villain involves questionably massive ""collateral damage"". For whatever reason, the hero's victory over death and destruction directly or indirectly leads to an even greater wave of death and destruction, or at least an even greater threat of such. Oh dear.
Maybe the villain themselves will warn the hero about the possible consequences, as a last-ditch attempt to save their own skin, or as a bitter ""parting shot"" to ruin the hero's victory (""You fools... do you even know what you've done?""). Villains being villains, this may just be a bluff. Or maybe the villain will just lament over how the hero defeated them despite all their efforts - it wasn't some sort of plan of theirs for the hero to ""win"" and thus make things worse (if it was, that'd be My Death Is Just the Beginning). Then again, Poor Communication Kills often comes into play as the villain will usually be uselessly vague and give no concrete reason for why foiling him would be bad. On the other other hand, a clear warning might be taken as Cassandra Truth anyway. You can't win.
If the mission was a rescue, it was an Unwanted Rescue, and the former captive may bitterly inform them of the true facts.
In most cases, of course, the hero's new mission is to stop the new danger they've unleashed, preferably in a way that doesn't spawn ever greater menaces. Darker plotlines may end the story right there instead, and it's always possible the villain's demise inadvertently resulted in the irreversible destruction or horrifying mutation of the world. If used excessively, this trope often leaves an audience with a sense that the hero shouldn't have tried to change things for the better and indeed shouldn't have even left home, which can be a Family-Unfriendly Aesop, but also a more literal moral about getting seriously involved in things without learning much about them.
This trope can be annoying in video games as often-times Stupidity Is the Only Option, particularly in the case of a MacGuffin Delivery Service... It is not particularly fair to try to make the player feel guilty about a course of action they had no control over, and indeed, might've gotten a ""Game Over"" if they attempted to not fulfill the objectives in question.
The term ""Pyrrhic Victory"" has the same connotation and originated from the Pyrrhic War fought by King Pyrrhus in 279 BC, which makes ""Nice Job Breaking It, Hero"" Older Than Feudalism. The tropes overlap, but Pyrrhic Victory is when someone succeeds at their goal with a very high price, while Nice Job Breaking It, Hero includes actions that might not be necessary or even intentional. In addition, this trope sometimes results in no victory at all, not even a Pyrrhic one.
Sometimes a badly thought-out plot for the sake of action has exactly the same effect when Fridge Logic catches its tail. That's one of the reasons why a good Game Master habit is writing the plot starting from the ""what happens if Player Characters aren't here at all or do nothing"" point.
This trope is a common problem with the Small Steps Hero. Compare Create Your Own Villain, What the Hell, Hero?, Unwitting Pawn, Must Make Amends, You Already Changed the Past, Two Rights Make a Wrong, Nice Job Fixing It, Villain! (but note that villains are also subject to this trope — they can do something careless that screws them over or helps out a worse villain). Compare We Want Our Jerk Back when the hero/villain makes the villain/hero powerless, only to have it backfire and give them a worse villain/hero/fate than expected, resulting in them wanting things to go back the way they were. Better the Devil You Know is a similar situation, where the utter defeat of one villain can lead to a completely different and greater evil taking over. This trope may lead to a Redemption Quest in an attempt to make up for the mistake. Has very little to do with Nice Job Breaking It, Herod! (in fact, that one usually leads to the biggest cases of the complete opposite Trope.)
Hitler's Time Travel Exemption Act, in certain cases, is a Sub-Trope of this. See also Had to Come to Prison to Be a Crook, which is this as applied to a legal system. (Or at least a well-intentioned one.) May overlap with Self-Fulfilling Prophecy. No Endor Holocaust is what happens when this is ineptly averted. And if the hero dies following the reveal and is unable to stop the new menace, you've just read a Shoot the Shaggy Dog story. Despite obvious parallels, most Load-Bearing Boss in video games do not fall under this category. When this happens with fandoms, it's Why Fandom Can't Have Nice Things. Pacifism Backfire is ""Nice Job Sparing Him, Hero"". Compare Tragic Mistake.
No real-life examples are allowed (Truth in Television as it is), and for that, you have no one to blame but yourselves.
Spoilers ahead, of course."
t15268,NiceJobFixingItVillain,"Basically, the heroes have a problem. It could range from personal, to being vital in their quests. Then an antagonist does something, either accidentally or deliberately but with an unintended effect, that instead fixes this problem nicely. It's like a Kick the Dog, but instead of hurting the dog, it pops one of the dog's dislocated bones back into place.
Sometimes it can be a single act. Sometimes it can be just one too many moves The Chessmaster makes, and the villain becomes their very own Spanner in the Works.
Say the Evil Overlord decides to smash the hero's Orphan's Plot Trinket just For the Evulz, and then it turns out that trinket was a Power Limiter that the hero wasn't able to break himself (or wasn't aware had that function), and now The Hero lays a No-Holds-Barred Beatdown on the overlord.
This is often Played for Laughs. Sometimes the Minion with an F in Evil is responsible for this.
This trope on its own just has the villain do this independently of the heroes. If the heroes trick the villain into fixing their problem, then this trope combines with either Briar Patching or a Batman Gambit.
May overlap with Dick Dastardly Stops to Cheat if the villain had victory in hand before he did whatever he did.
Compare Hoist by His Own Petard (when the villains foil their own plans), Villain Ball, Bad Guys Do the Dirty Work, Poke the Poodle, Phlebotinum Rebel (when the villain creates the hero), Tactical Suicide Boss (when an enemy can only be beaten by exploiting a certain move) and due to the G.I.F.T., Why Fandom Can't Have Nice Things (when fans do it).
Contrast Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!, From Bad to Worse, Two Rights Make a Wrong.
Super-Trope to Create Your Own Hero.
This is not villains hurting their own plans or failing to break something (like resistance against them). ""Fixing"" in this case means solving a problem they did not know existed, or were trying to exploit.
WARNING: Unmarked spoilers ahead!"
t15274,NiceToTheWaiter,"In fiction, you can usually tell the good guys from the bad guys by the way they treat the working class.
Heroic people will treat service staff nicely. Whether they're Spoiled Sweet, a Benevolent Boss or just a super Nice Guy, heroic characters will Pet the Dog by being polite, generous and personable with doormen, waiters, secretaries and so forth. They might remember people's names, exchange pleasantries, tip well, or just generally treat them as human beings worthy of dignity and respect. Even a grouchy Jerk with a Heart of Gold who snaps at all of his social equals can reveal his Hidden Depths by showing kindness and consideration to those below him.
On the flip side, villains can Kick the Dog by abusing their inferiors. Whether they're an Evil Artistocrat, Corrupt Corporate Executive, Mean Boss or garden-variety asshole, they'll treat servants and service staff with callous disregard, if not open contempt. A good way to expose a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing is to show how they treat the staff when no one who matters is around.
The trope can get more complicated when an Affably Evil Villain with Good Publicity carefully cultivates this image, showing superficial kindness to the common man to achieve their own selfish ends. A real hero will expect nothing from their kindness.
The response of the servants can vary widely. Some might feel Undying Loyalty simply for a generous tip, while others might be unimpressed by serving a superheroic boss. Those who foolishly antagonize food staff might get some Laser-Guided Karma causing them to ask, ""I Ate WHAT?!"" when The Dog Bites Back.
A Mean Boss is a specific version to this trope where the character abuses direct employees. See Sympathetic Slave Owner for an even more exaggerated version of someone who is unexpectedly kind to his social inferiors as a telling character trait. Contrast with the Professional Butt-Kisser, who shows kindness to his superiors in hopes of reward. Someone who is not nice to the waiter may perform a Bratty Food Demand. See also Interclass Friendship."
t15362,NoCelebritiesWereHarmed,"Sometimes a character's entire shtick will be that he or she is a thinly disguised imitation of some celebrity somewhere. The more blatant examples will often have a parody of that celebrity's name. This can be done for various reasons, such as to serve as a homage and/or parody, to make a point using the character (see picture to the right), or simply because the writers think that it would be cool. Though some consider it done because the writers are out of ideas. Many creators and viewers alike do not like it because it tends to smack of unoriginality and destroys the conceit that the work's universe is entirely fictional (though, of course, if the work is outright going for realism, it's quite appropriate). However, this does have the side effect of making the work an Unintentional Period Piece for the period of the work's creation, as later audiences, to varying degrees of success, can see through the ""thinly disguised"" part of the parody and clearly determine that the work was made during the height of the target's popularity.
The most common impressions to hear in cartoons are Jack Nicholson, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone for tough-guy characters, Peter Lorre or Vincent Price for creepy characters, R. Lee Ermey for Drill Sergeant Nasties, Maurice Chevalier for a song and dance man or stock French Funny Foreigner character, Paul Lynde for Camp Gay characters, Bela Lugosi for vampires, Boris Karloff for Frankenstein's monster, Sean Connery or Don Adams for secret agents, Donald Pleasance for an action villain, Ed Wynn for assorted silly characters, John Wayne or Clint Eastwood for cowboys, Paul Hogan for Australians, Howard Cosell or John Madden for sports announcers, Joe Pesci or Ray Liotta for mobsters, and Mae West for vamps. As for more general examples, heavy-metal rocker characters will be given a Metal Scream of the sort perfected by the likes of Robert Plant, Steven Tyler, and Rob Halford. ""Stoner"" characters will tend to be based on either the Sean Penn character (""Spicoli"") in Fast Times at Ridgemont High or the Dennis Hopper character in Apocalypse Now. Anyone doing a stock pirate character (""Ahrrr, matey!"") is paying tribute to Robert Newton's performance as Long John Silver in Disney's Treasure Island (1950). The witch stereotype is based on The Wicked Witch of the West.
May double as a Parental Bonus, when it is mostly aimed at kids.
As noted The Ahnold is a common form of this, as are Mock Cousteau and Mr. Alt Disney.
If it's a fictional character that's being imitated, then it's an Expy or Captain Ersatz. The trope does not apply in the case of adaptations of live-action source materials, where the character designs are obliged to be based on the real actors. When the creators actively deny that the character was meant to be caricature of the person, see Denied Parody.
Compare Ink-Suit Actor, where a celebrity voices an animated caricature of themself. Comic-Book Fantasy Casting is a much milder version of this, where a real actor or other celebrity is used as a guide for a character's appearance but with no attempt to caricature their persona. Write Who You Know is for where a character is based on somebody who the creator personally knows, but not necessarily a celebrity. If the famous personality is an historical character that is already dead, especially it's from centuries ago, then it's No Historical Figures Were Harmed.
Note that some character voices, most notably those reminiscent of Peter Lorre and of John Wayne, are by now fourth-generation copies that have more to do with earlier impressions than with the original actors' voices. There may also be some overlap with the ""Weird Al"" Effect if the caricature is more familiar to younger audiences than the actual celebrity.
See also Lawyer-Friendly Cameo, No Communities Were Harmed, and Adam Westing. See Bland-Name Product for the equivalent treatment of a product (or possibly a business entity) rather than a person, potentially applying just as much detail to the parody.
Tuckerization is the inverse."
t15405,NoHistoricalFiguresWereHarmed,"Some authors borrow ideas. Others steal them outright. Regardless, one of the most common approaches is to steal from reality, inserting thinly disguised versions of historical personalities into a work of fiction.
This trope exclusively refers to characters that reference historical figures (herein defined as people who are dead at the time the work was first exhibited to the public). From emperors based on Augustus, Nero, or Caligula through modern military dictators inspired by Hitler, Stalin, Pinochet and their ilk, from revolutionaries based on Che Guevara and gangsters who homage Al Capone through pirates who owe something to Blackbeard (if male) or Anne Bonny (if female), to Howard Hughes style eccentric millionaires, fiction abounds with characters inspired by deceased real-life counterparts.
This trope differs from Expy in that it refers to characters derived exclusively from real-life historical figures and not other fictional characters. It differs from No Celebrities Were Harmed because it does not describe figures who are contemporaries of the author at the time of writing, nor is it a Roman à Clef in which historical events are deliberately disguised. Rather it can be considered Historical Fiction or a Sidelong Glance Biopic with the Serial Numbers Filed Off to make a historical figure into someone fictional. The character need not exactly line up to the historical narrative in overall trajectory, and one shouldn't judge for accuracy since Dated History and Society Marches On abound, and new evidence will occasionally arise to challenge preexisting conceptions. On occasion, an author may also utilize a Composite Character modeled on several different figures, or a Decomposite Character who divides a single historical figure's role among more than one character. So long as the character or characters are recognizably modeled on a historical figure or figures (or at least the public perception of that figure) this trope remains in play.
Remember that almost every author bases characters on someone they know from life and reading. This is when explicit historical models supply the base, overall characteristic, themes and impressions of the character design.
Super-Trope of:
May crop up as part of a Fantasy Counterpart Culture. Contrast Historical Domain Character, where a version of the historical figure actually appears directly rather than having a fictional character based on him."
t15451,NoNameGiven,"A major character is never referred to by their actual or full name, instead being addressed by a title, nickname, Only One Name, or none at all. Reasons for this vary, but it often serves the function of making a character seem more mysterious or eccentric.
In older (pre-1900 in North America; pre-1970 in the UK) fiction, a narrator may refer to a character (especially an older or more socially prominent character) by his or her surname. This is because at that time first names were much less commonly used socially than they are now; a young character may not even know the first name of an older character he or she is not related to. It was also common in that time to blank out the names of real people to avoid lawsuits and the like. This is often true in Japanese media set in the modern day as well, as first names are seen as being incredibly personal and sometimes not even used by close friends who still opt to use the surname. Interestingly, the reverse is true if the work is set in some periods of Japanese history where the size of many of the clans that dominated society meant that it was hard to figure out who you were talking about if you just used the surname so given names were used more instead. In other Asian media, however, you will often hear people referred to by their first names, but almost never by their last names - partly because of the low diversity of surnames in many Asian languages.
A common joke is to do The Un Reveal on the full name.
This trope can be somewhat justified, however, due to Nominal Importance: it's difficult enough for the writers to come up with good names for the main protagonists; it would be incredibly painstaking to come up with equally good names for a cast of characters who exist solely as part of the setting and serve no further purpose to the narrative.
Another common variation is for a series where a child is the main character to have parents only referred to as Mom and Dad.
Sometimes, a main protagonist will have no name to add to their mystique.
Or it may be because they can't be named.
When this trope is applied to work titles themselves, not just character names, it's No Title.
Compare The Trope Without a Title, You Know the One, and I Know Your True Name (which may be a reason for this). Contrast Only One Name, Everyone Calls Him ""Barkeep"", and I Am Not Shazam. Compare and contrast The Scottish Trope, for where characters know a name, but actively avoid saying it. See also Nameless Narrative and The All-Concealing ""I"". When a character genuinely has no name whatsoever (as opposed to it not being given in the work), then they are The Nameless. If the character's parents never named them, then they were Never Given a Name. When a character is literally given the name ""Nobody"", then they are Somebody Named Nobody."
t15494,NonPOVProtagonist,"Some written works feature a consistent Point of View: namely, through the eyes of The Protagonist. Other works throw in additional protagonists and pass the POV around to present each of their respective views on the transpiring events. Sometimes, however, a single main character (usually the one with the most ambiguous/mysterious motivation) is conspicuously denied POV and their impact upon the plot is only ever seen through the eyes of co-protagonists. This character is the Non-POV Protagonist of the book.
The main purpose of the trope is to create dramatic tension. When a story is told from the perspective of a character, readers become very familiar with him or her, and can make some predictions as to their feelings and reactions. When a story does not give the perspective of a character, readers are left peering in, wondering just what is going through that person's head. That can be quite a tense experience if said character is The Chosen One, the Big Bad, or even just a Supporting Leader who will nonetheless be making decisions that the narrator characters have to live with.
Due to the nature of the medium, this is primarily a literary trope, though media closely related to literature may also use it.
Related tropes (that often accompany this) include Supporting Protagonist, a POV-character who is a protagonist, just not the ""main-main"" one; and First-Person Peripheral Narrator, a narrator character who isn't a protagonist. In those terms, this trope describes a ""main-main"" protagonist who isn't a POV-character."
t15522,NoodleIncident,"The Noodle Incident is something from the past that is sometimes referred to but never explained, with the implication that it's just too ludicrous for words—or perhaps too offensive for depiction—and the reality that any explanation would fall short of audience expectations. Questions about it are often met with ""You Don't Want To Know…"" Persisting is a good way to press a character's Berserk Button.
Commonly introduced to the audience by having characters react to some fantastic and improbable event with ""Oh no, not again."" The key to this trope is that the audience is left to imagine what happened based on vague hints or clues, with funny (or scary) results.
Named for an incident referenced by the characters of Calvin and Hobbes, where the author admitted he decided against ever stating what happened, as he figured nothing he could come up with would be as outrageous as what the readers thought happened.note It originated from the Sept. 14, 1990 strip, in which the word ""incident"" was not used, but was used all the time after that, starting with the December 12, 1990 strip.
Don't be surprised if it was caused by a trickster-type character. If there's a noodle incident and a trickster happens to be in the main cast, the trickster is almost always responsible for it, or at least blamed for it.
Almost always a case of Nothing Is Funnier, particularly if it has an outlandish name, such as the Trope Namer. Compare with Cryptic Background Reference, In-Joke, Jackhammered Conversation, Noodle Implements, Second-Hand Storytelling, Take Our Word for It, That Mysterious Thing, and What Did I Do Last Night?. Comedy counterpart to Nothing Is Scarier, where the imagined horror is more effective than what could be explained. Reminiscing about a Noodle Incident by the people involved can result in Lost in Transmission for an outsider. Compare and contrast Offscreen Moment of Awesome, where the off-screen incident would have been better on-screen. See also Cow Tools. Enough such incidents create a character who has Seen It All. If a Noodle Incident is essential to solving a mystery, it's a Riddle for the Ages. If it results in the person/people involved being banished from wherever it happened, they've become Persona Non Grata. And if, many episodes or installments later, we finally get to see the incident and all the details about it (at least one TV series season, book volume, or film sequel has to be in the gap), the ensuing new episode/installment becomes the Resolved Noodle Incident. See also Great Offscreen War. Contrast Oblivious Mockery, where characters talk about an event they don't know happened but the viewer does (most of the time).
In Spy Fiction or similar stories with two longtime allies, the Noodle Incident is usually referred to by a place's name. ""This is just like Budapest!"" ""Remember Helsinki?"" ""God, it's Rio de Janeiro all over again."" Sometimes this is elaborated upon, but usually not.
To be clear, this isn't simply a reference to something that is never shown ""on-screen"". A Noodle Incident is marked by a lack of information, shown or told. Bob saying to Alice, ""Remember that time we robbed a bank?"" does not qualify, whereas ""Remember the bank?"" does.
Naturally, this trope is a good source of Fanfic Fuel. Often overlaps with Getting Crap Past the Radar. Contrast with Remember When You Blew Up a Sun?, which is where the reminiscence is anything but ambiguous.
Not to be confused with The Google Incident (or the second one), although you might get this vibe from some tropers."
t15718,NotSoDifferent,"When one character in a pair — who'd otherwise be different and/or unrelated — discovers that they actually have some things in common, more than the other character would want to believe.
This is usually the resolution of an Enemy Mine or Locked in a Freezer plot: two enemies learn that there is more that unites them than divides them. The punch line to about 50% of plots in an Odd Couple or Odd Friendship series.
On the darker side, this trope can also be used to lampshade the fact that our hero is really just a hair's breadth away from villainy. In these cases, it's almost always the villain who is the first to notice: our hero has him cornered and even seems to relish the prospect of finally ridding himself of his nemesis, and the villain deftly points out, ""We're not so different after all"", commonly as a way to guilt-trip the hero. This may also be used to try to sway the hero to join his side. The hero realizes how close he is to crossing the line, and spares the villain (though every once in a great while, he'll decide that it's worth crossing the line, off the villain anyway, and then have several episodes of moral anguish over the darkness in his soul: see Shoot the Dog). Especially common when the villain is the hero's Evil Counterpart.
Also a bad thing when the bad guy points it out after the hero has bested him through questionable tactics. Often followed by the hero's hysterical protests along the lines of, ""I'm not like you! I'll never be like you!"" Occasionally followed by the hero's observation that they are different, because of some other aspect that the opponent overlooked or intentionally ignored. However, the hero sometimes has some snappier comeback, like ""You noticed?"" or ""That's why I can beat you,"" and worries about the differences later—or a comment that the dog that protects the flock is a very close relative of the wolf that ravages it. Then again, a simple ""shut up"" can work wonders. Another common rebuttal is for the hero to acknowledge that they share some similarities, but are sufficiently different where it counts; not all similarities are equal.
The Horseshoe Effect is when two people claim to be ideologically opposed to one another, but nevertheless have many beliefs in common.
When the villain who believes this also believes that the hero denies it because he is a Slave to PR, he often sets up What You Are in the Dark to get the hero to act like it. The failure rate for this approach is... high.
Heroes sometimes use this to confront a Well-Intentioned Extremist or a Knight Templar as to call them out or to try to redeem them. Being compared to their enemy will often trigger their Berserk Button. Contrasts with Not So Similar and You Keep Telling Yourself That. Also compare Shared Family Quirks, which is when two seemingly different family members have something in common behavior wise. Hitler Ate Sugar is when this trope is stretched to the point of becoming a fallacy."
t15835,ObfuscatingStupidity,"Also sometimes known as ""playing dumb"", a tactic whose effectiveness is predicated on characters convincing others they are complete oafs and therefore harmless. Acting like an ignorant hayseed, misinformed tourist, Handsome Lech, or Funny Foreigner is popular.
A variant of this, primarily found in teen comedies, is the popular student (almost invariably a girl) who acts like The Ditz in order to avoid being stigmatized as a nerd; in such cases, the character may be willfully ignorant, but inevitably faces a situation where she needs her native wits to escape a problem.
This differs from the Genius Ditz in that the latter is brilliant in a single field (or multiple obscure fields) but genuinely ditzy otherwise. Another variant is of someone who is a genuine genius but who pretends to be The Fool in order to avoid responsibility, either because they are lazy or because of some trauma which has undermined their confidence. May appear to be The Fool until the viewer realizes he's just so good at making intentional actions seem like total coincidences that it appears to be blind luck. If done well, you may not be able to tell if the character is an Almighty Janitor, a Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass, a not-so-Inept Mage, or a Bunny-Ears Lawyer. Or, for that matter, Too Dumb to Fool, especially if the character is good at noticing what is too obvious to be seen.
A favorite tactic of The Trickster. The opposite trope is Feigning Intelligence. See also the Old Master, to whom using this trope comes as natural as breathing; Covert Pervert, where the ""stupidity"" may be in reference to a particular subject; and Rich Idiot with No Day Job, a special case of this trope. See also Fauxreigner and Bilingual Backfire. Compare Obfuscating Insanity. Blondes may exploit the Dumb Blonde stereotype to help with the obfuscation. Another tactic characters doing this will use is pretending to be Easily Impressed to make it seem like they have no sense of judgment of quality. A Good Is Not Dumb character is often accused of using this trope.
This can backfire in a big way if the person using Obfuscating Stupidity needs people to trust him or her—only to realize that no one will believe the ""idiot"". Inversely, if other characters think the person is being obfuscating but he really is simple-minded, then he's a Seemingly Profound Fool. Occasional lapses might be dismissed with Too Dumb to Fool.
This may lead to someone Underestimating Badassery.
This is not to be confused with Smarter Than You Look, where that trope has no intention of appearing to be unintelligent; the character simply can't help the appearance of stupidity they have.
This is Older Than Feudalism, occurring in the Book of Genesis and in legends of the earliest days of Rome. note In this context, the trope name refers to fake stupidity obfuscating the intelligence of the person. In other words, ""obfuscating stupidity"" is the method being used, a person is not obfuscating stupidity themselves. It is also the core of the 27th stratagem.
Contrast Feigning Intelligence. See also Beneath the Mask, Faking Amnesia, Obfuscating Disability, Obfuscating Insanity, Deliberate Under-Performance, and Playing Sick.

t15906,OddFriendship,"A friendship which develops between two characters that would seem unlikely to be friends, whether it's because of them having diametrically opposed personalities, holding beliefs that would normally get one to try to demonize the other, or some other quirks of their beings that would lead to them clashing. Through their friendship, they learn more about each other and about themselves.
The characters in an Odd Friendship may have little to do with each other initially — or even begin as bitter enemies — and their friendship grows over time.
Distinguished from an Odd Couple in that these are usually two characters in an ensemble show, or a regular character and a Recurrer; whereas an Odd Couple usually consists of the two main characters in a show.

t15955,OffOnATechnicality,"The criminal is caught, comes up for a trial — and then it turns out that he wasn't read his Miranda Warning, or the Cowboy Cop forgot to get a search warrant, or the confession was obtained via Jack Bauer Interrogation Technique. The judge is forced to throw the case out and the (alleged) crook walks free to offend again while their victims are left to suffer the ruling of a legal system more concerned about ""procedure"" than ""justice"".
In stories where a Vigilante Man or Cowboy Cop is the protagonist, the bleeding heart judiciary will accept any half-baked excuse for letting criminals go free. This is often a case of artistic license as in Real Life technicalities frequently don't apply the way they are depicted or may not even exist. If the accused person is the protagonist, then the ""technicality"" will actually be an albatross for them, because no-one will believe they're actually innocent until the end of the story/series when the actual criminal is found.
Most prevalent back in the 1960s and 1970s with the vigilante justice fad in fiction, after several court decisions seemed to tip the balance of the legal system far in favor of the accused. Since then, Real Life police and other law enforcement personnel have had these changes included into their training to avoid screwing up their cases, and the fictional versions have become rarer. It still happens, but unlike in fiction, it's more often the excuse for the acquittal, rather than the reason. Such as when a judge or jury doesn't feel the person is guilty in spite of the evidence or does, but feels their actions were justified, and exploits the technicality as a legal grounds to dismiss the case. Multiple technicalities certainly can be the reason for someone being acquitted, but it wouldn't be this trope, as this is when a single technicality results in a ""not guilty"" ruling.
The Downplayed versions, on the other hand, are absolutely Truth in Television. One example is where the technicality doesn't acquit someone outright, but goes in the defendant's favor. Most court cases are not made or broken on one thing, for either side. So a technicality can still reasonably be expected to influence the outcome of a case, but isn't likely to make or break it. Another example is the technicality resulting in a shaky case being dropped, or police falling just short of either reasonable suspicion or probable cause based on technicalities. If a case that's being built isn't particularly strong, it's not unheard of for prosecutors to either drop such cases or avoid putting too much energy into them if something, technicality or otherwise, gets in the way. So a technicality being just enough for an already iffy case not to end up in court is also Justified, as it happens in Real Life.
In a Police Procedural, such as Law  Order, this will usually come in at the first quarter-hour mark, when the initial case falls through, and the DA tells the cops to find some non-tainted evidence or charges to rebuild a case from.
The Amoral Attorney with Rule Fu Stronger Than Yours loves taking advantage of this. The justice system may counteract it by Justice by Other Legal Means. The Insanity Defense is a version of this where the defendant (or their advocate) admits they did it but argues they aren't responsible for their actions because they were mentally incapable of determining right from wrong at the time."
t15980,OffWithHisHead,"If you're dealing with any sword-oriented media, whether it be fantasy, medieval, kung fu, or something else, and it's more violent than a PG-13 rating, chances are, someone is going to get his head chopped off (and it may not even need the R rating if you're dealing with nonhuman enemies). One of the most common methods of execution back in the medieval era next to hanging, decapitation is usually one of the surest ways to ensure someone is Deader Than Dead barring some very potent magic or divine intervention. Indeed, in Real Life, it is one of the very few ways that death can be instantly diagnosed.
Any Ridiculously Human Robot (even one with a Cranial Processing Unit) or other decidedly inhuman being will probably be capable of surviving decapitation, and will do so at some point either for a joke or as a plot point. In less serious series, the body will even continue to walk around bumping into things like a chicken or a cockroach with its head cut off.
It is nearly always depicted as being surprisingly easy to cut through someone's whole neck and spinal column, even in one blow to a moving target. While Anne Boleyn did get beheaded with one stroke, most pre-guillotine beheadings took at least three strokes. Boleyn's executioner was—by request—a professional swordsman who would know how to cleanly behead someone. And that's when the target is helpfully restrained; in an actual Sword Fight it would have been even harder to pull off and would also have been serious overkill. A direct cut through the skull into the brain—or a strike to the neck that would at least sever critical blood vessels or the windpipe if it didn't cut through the spine—was usually more expedient.
This trope is named after the line Off with his head; — so much for Buckingham from Colley Cibber's adaptation of Richard III. The trope was also famously used by the Queen of Hearts in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. See also Your Head A-Splode for a much gorier version of this trope and Boom, Headshot! when it comes to firearms.
May result in a Human Head on the Wall.
Also see Alas, Poor Yorick, Decapitation Presentation and Severed Head Sports. When cutting off the head is the only way to kill something, it's Decapitation Required. If the decapitated head is somehow still alive after the fact for any notable length of time, that's Losing Your Head.
Not to be confused with a Decapitation Strike, which is about decapitating a whole faction rather than just some person.
As per being a death trope, EXPECT UNMARKED SPOILERS!!!"
t15984,OhCrap,"The moment at which a character realizes that something really, REALLY bad is about to happen. Either that, or it already has, and they are in big trouble because of it. They may not always say anything in particular when they do, but even if they don't, the look on their face clearly conveys to the audience their realization. This moment often features stronger language, and is when they truly realize that the solid organic waste is about to collide with the Rotational Air Circulation Device.note Shit hits the fan. Sometimes the first few notes of Fryderyk Chopin's Funeral March are used as background music to highlight how grim the situation is.
They may feel that This Is Gonna Suck, and often exclaim, ""You Have Got to Be Kidding Me!"" or perhaps ""I Want My Mommy!"" or sometimes even ""This Cannot Be!"" Other characters might emit a Loud Gulp instead. Some might even freeze in fear completely.
The effectiveness of this moment can be affected by the difference between their usual competence and confidence levels and how completely they are boned. Characters with low self-esteem or who are constantly crying out in terror are difficult (but not impossible) to make this trope work with. But that arrogant, so far unbeatable supervillain suddenly realizing they're about to have his ass royally kicked? Now we're talking!
Can occur if one protagonist has been luring the other one into a trap, or if they just have some shiny new skill. Or they may simply be a lower-level villain who's just had the very bad luck to be confronted with a hero impossibly out of his league and is about to be on the wrong end of a Curb-Stomp Battle. On occasion, they will be discussing the situation when they realize the full import of it. Related to This Cannot Be!, and the polar opposite of Obi-Wan Moment, when despite the bad situation someone still manages to look composed. May result in a Heroic BSoD for a heroic character, or even a Villainous Breakdown for a villainous character. Nine times out of ten, this will immediately follow ""What does this button do?"". The remaining tenth follow some other temptation of fate. Also a very common reaction when a villain, normally a Chess Master, Villain with Good Publicity, or Manipulative Bastard, realizes they've just been the victim of an Engineered Public Confession. Some characters react with less despair and more apathy; others look to their equipment for a solution. And for some, it is the crowning moment of despair.
When this trope becomes literal, that's Bring My Brown Pants—as Bill Cosby once said, ""first you say it, then you do it!""
May also be a Precision F-Strike for the person in question.
When most of the cast available in the scene does this expression, it's a Mass ""Oh, Crap!"" moment. If someone tries to explain the situation to someone else, and realizes half-way through their own explanation they're in real trouble, it's Explain, Explain... Oh, Crap!. If the person making the realization doesn't try to explain and says nothing but ""Run,"" it's time to Run or Die. If you realize you're in trouble after your explanation, or if someone tells you something really bad is about to happen and Oh Crap isn’t your first reaction, it's a Delayed ""Oh, Crap!"". When you try to save some face by putting on a happy face, you make an ""Oh, Crap!"" Smile. When you pretend to realize you are in trouble only to mess with your opponent, it's an ""Oh, Crap!"" Fakeout. When your primary reaction is resigned acceptance of the situation, it's This Is Gonna Suck. When a character soils him or herself upon this realization,note In other words, ""Oh Crap"" becomes literal.
The trope also applies to wetting themselves but that's less literal. it's Bring My Brown Pants.
See also Wide Eyes and Shrunken Irises. Say Your Prayers may be involved as part of this reaction.
Contrast ""Hell, Yes!"" Moment, the exact inverse.
Warning: High risk of spoilers."
t15990,OhMyGods,"Even though many churches really don't want us to use the Lord's name in vain, many people, especially in fiction, will end up saying ""Goddammit"" or ""Oh My God"" for one reason or anothernote (though technically, ""God"" isn't His name; even the words it's translated from (""El"", ""Eloah"", and ""Elohim"") are more like describing what He is rather than a name). And the commandment in The Bible was originally about making false oaths anyway. However, a writer can't invoke a god in a fantasy environment because monotheism is rare, so where we say ""Oh My God"", characters in the fantasy universe will say ""Oh My Gods!""
Depending on how developed the world is, it is also quite common to invoke actual gods by name, such as the Gauls in Asterix saying ""By Toutatis!"" (well, he was an actual Gaulish god). Another common variation used by future civilizations is to invoke science or scientists instead. Occasionally an Alternate History with a non-monotheistic major religion will use this to demonstrate how different that world is. Sometimes a Physical God will reference themselves in this manner, with ""By me!"", ""I swear by myself!"",""Jesus H. Me!"" or similar.
Basically Truth in Television: although ""Oh My Gods"" isn't realistic, just plain ""Gods!"" does occur in Greek and Roman literature as an exclamation, although admittedly the emphasis is a little different (the speaker will usually address the gods with an appeal for help or an incredulous ""Do you see this?""), and phrases like ""ye gods"" (and its minced-oath version ""egad"") or ""by the gods"" are equally common (a variation is ""by Helios"", since the sun sees everything and is the god of oaths; interestingly the Franks also swore by the sun). (Also common was the singular ""God"", which might mean either the chief god of the pantheon, or whatever god the speaker happened to be particularly devoted to.) Even more vulgar constructions have been found as well; a popular epithet found carved into walls by Roman hooligans is ""By Juno's twat!"" It's not uncommon in modern times, either; depending on what circles you travel in.
The inverse is Orphaned Etymology, which writers may consider avoiding. If, in the created world, there is nobody referred to as ""God"", and if there isn't at least a belief in an afterlife/underworld called Hell, then nobody should use expressions that invoke either — although a charitable audience could always put this down to Translation Convention.
Compare Answers to the Name of God, when someone swears ""My God!"" (or the equivalent), only for another character to reply ""Yes?""

t16009,OlderSidekick,"Because we expect an older character to have more experience, a sidekick older than the main hero is a rare thing. Outside traditional Super Hero comics, there are several reasons to use them.
One is that the older character won't fall out of the Competence Zone because they're under the direction of the younger hero, and thus doesn't undermine their maturity. If the relationship is close, the sidekick's more adult qualities actually fulfill some kind of parental role, which the hero might lack from having no family, without being intrusive. On the other hand, the Older Sidekick can be a non-threatening (yet incredibly appealing) fantasy object for the audience, who identifies with the main hero. A variant of this is when the younger character leads due to rank or status but requires the more experienced sidekick for advice. A typical example of this would be Captain Smooth and Sergeant Rough.
Another is that the main character may be too young or small to possess much physical power. Their expertise lies elsewhere, thus the Older Sidekick also is the Battle Butler who goes everywhere the main character does, instead of merely staying home and
minding the house. Often, in these cases, there only appears to be an age difference, or the age difference is the opposite of what it appears so it's not as hard to justify them hanging around each other.
A related dynamic is when the two characters have an (increasingly) equal partnership, but there's just enough of an age difference to inspire protective feelings in the older one. Usually both characters are designed to appeal to different segments of the fandom, and the story will end up using many designs that appeal to shippers (compare Seme and Uke). Think of it as a more intimate version of the Buddy Cop dynamic.
In fact, the Older Sidekick is very handy for lessening the perceived squick of shipping the characters, as the audience seem much more willing to rationalize that the characters are on equal grounds."
t16011,OlderThanTheyLook,"Sometimes characters don't look their age. Whether it was a deliberate artistic choice on the behalf of the creator (usually to make the character more attractive or to legally fulfill a fetish) or something much deeper and linked to their characterization and the plot, this character will be older than they look. Although still within the normal range of the human lifespan (for that setting, anyway), this character will look noticeably younger than their age. Sometimes even improbably younger; it's not unheard of for a seeming teenager to be over the hill chronologically.
This is an extremely common trope in Speculative Fiction, where Functional Magic or Applied Phlebotinum can be used to explain the characters appearance being at odds with their age.
When science fiction or fantasy takes this trope Up to Eleven, it leads to Really 700 Years Old, The Ageless, or a Time Abyss. See also Age Is Relative and Improbable Age. Not to be confused with Older Than They Think. Contrast with Younger Than They Look. If they're just drawn in a way that makes them seem older, it's Artistic Age. When a character is played by a much younger actor, it becomes Hollywood Old unless the difference is justified. When the actor is older than the character they portray, it's Dawson Casting (although the actor themselves may just fit this trope, justifying the Dawson Casting).
Compare Mistaken Age, Age-Inappropriate Dress. For characters that don't look younger than their age but are still good-looking, see Silver Fox. Contrast Animation Anatomy Aging.
Remember, this trope only covers characters who aren't impossibly old, just much older than they look. For characters who are impossibly old, see Really 700 Years Old and Time Abyss."
t16068,Omniglot,"Most people find it hard work to achieve native-level fluency in just one foreign language, even when they're a full-time student of it, but a fictional character might speak thirty languages well enough to be mistaken for a native speaker in each. This character might learn the local language fluently just by chatting while playing cards each evening for a few weeks, or perhaps due to having taken evening classes for a month when they were twenty years younger, they are able to win debates on metaphysics in a particular language. At the very least, they read the Genius Book Club books in the original language, even if that language is a dead language.
Sometimes there may be justification for this — perhaps it's a superpower, perhaps the character is immortal (and thus had the time to learn the languages the regular way) or perhaps they had an Upgrade Artifact. Sure, some people genuinely are good at languages, but sometimes it shows a lack of research — the author is not aware that learning a foreign language properly can be quite difficult and time-consuming (perhaps because the author has never properly attempted to learn a second language himself).
This is sometimes introduced via Suddenly Always Knew That; ""Whoa, you speak Finnish? Mitä ihmettä? note Finnish language for ""What the heck?""You never mentioned that!"" ""You Never Asked.""
The fact that young children are better at learning languages than older children, adults, or teenagers makes this trope easier to justify if the character in question was either A) raised in a highly multilingual environment or B) a Child Prodigy who learned languages for fun when they were four years old.
Such a character may be a Cunning Linguist, but that's a character role rather than a trait. A Mary Sue can easily have this feature. This may also be a trait of The Face: they know ten languages instead of fighting styles like The Hero.
Not to be confused with the website Omniglot. Has nothing to do with Extreme Omni-Goat either."
t16164,OneSteveLimit,"A pretty rigid rule that no two characters in a work of fiction (novel, movie, play, TV series, comic book, etc.) should share the same first name, or even similar-sounding names. If there's a Laura in the story, there will not be a Lyra; if there's an Ed, there will not be a Ted. If you wake up one morning and suddenly discover that you don't know any two people with the same first name and that your phone number begins with 555, you can safely assume you've fallen into a work of fiction.
The rationale behind this is so obvious it almost doesn't need explanation: Both the audience and the writer will get confused by multiple characters with the same name: ""Wait, was it good-guy Steve or bad-guy Steve who launched the missile?""
A strong dramatic reason to duplicate names can override the rule, as, for example, in the Jack Nicholson movie The Two Jakes, but it's so rarely done that audiences will pick up on it almost instantly. Unintentional duplication of first or last names also sometimes occurs when characters from previously distinct works of fiction meet one another, or when fiction is in any way using individuals from Real Life, or in sprawling, shared-continuity settings like the DC or Marvel Comics universes.
It's probably more feasible to list the exceptions rather than examples. Usually when there are exceptions, there will be a storyline involving the characters being confused for each other.
One could only wish this were Truth in Television, but as teachers know all too well, names go through cycles and depending on the era, a single class might have five Jasons, Michaels, Elsas or Claras. Thus, this trope is generally considered an Acceptable Break From Reality.
In French-speaking countries, name popularity waves are even more dramatic, to the point where you can often guess somebody's age within five to ten years just by their given name, and very popular names have been attributed to as much as one person out of seven or eight at their peak.
This is also a problem in dubbing with ""dubbed names"". For example, Gomez Addams in Latin America is ""Homero"", just like Homer the Spider. Or a mobster named Bruno showing up in a Batman (who is known as ""Bruno Díaz"" instead of ""Bruce Wayne"") comic.
The antithesis is Planet of Steves, wherein everybody is Steve.
Compare One Mario Limit, where the ""Steve"" is too famous for anyone else to use a similar name. Contrast Inexplicably Identical Individuals, where there is a whole bunch of interchangeable characters that look the same and may share the same name—or have very similar names. Also contrast Name's the Same, where multiple series share one or more characters with the same name, and Same Surname Means Related, that removes the possibility that ""Steve"" and ""Tom, Dick and Harry"" having the same last name is just happenstance (even if/when they share one of the most common last names in whichever part of the world their franchise was produced). For moments where there's a one person limit for roles see Cast Speciation.
See also We Named the Monkey ""Jack"" and Dead Guy Junior, for other ways characters can share names."
t16219,OnlyKnownByTheirNickname,"This is a character who is primarily, or even only, known by their In-Series Nickname.
Related to Everyone Calls Him ""Barkeep"", but that is about people being referred to exclusively by their jobs or what they're best known for doing. Also related to Stage Names. Does not include Fan Nicknames, secret identities, or explicit pseudonyms. Also doesn't include people who give themselves new names following an act of self-reinvention, and stop responding to their old name (e.g. Voldemort). Exceptionally badass examples of this trope fall into the Red Baron. Obvious and common contractions, i.e. someone's full name being William but introducing themselves as Bill, don't really count either.
Usually, Dramatis Personae will give the full name of such a character first, though the actual script will use the nickname almost exclusively even in the unspoken directions.
If the character insists on the nickname, it's Do Not Call Me ""Paul"". If the nickname is actually his real name, it's His Name Really Is ""Barkeep""."
t16226,OnlyOneName,"The character or characters go by a single name, with no family/clan/whatever identifier. Unlike No Name Given, it's not that their full name is never made known to the viewer. The full name simply does not exist. Cher is an oft-cited example.
Truth in Television for most of history. Bynames, epithets, and family names were used only when necessary to distinguish between people with the same name. In much of the world, having multiple names is a relatively recent invention.
Sometimes appears in translations involving a Dub Name Change when it didn't in the original, such as Beetle Bailey being called just ""Masi"" in Finnish. This could be seen as going under Only Known by Their Nickname, but not when the character is addressed both on a First-Name Basis and Last-Name Basis in the original and the translation uses the one name for both.
Contrast I Have Many Names, and Repetitive Name for someone whose first name and last name are the same. Compare Everyone Calls Him ""Barkeep"" for an extreme example.
Not to be confused with the similar-sounding First-Name Basis or Only Known by Their Nickname."
t16230,OnlySaneMan,"When there is a group of characters who are all just totally weird, either in general or in a particular scenario, the Only Sane Man is the only one who, well, isn't.
Picture this: Alice is a Psycho for Hire, Bob is a Cloudcuckoolander, Doug is an Empty Shell, and Emily is a Mad Scientist. Looks like your standard Dysfunction Junction. But then you have Gardenia. Gardenia is actually a very well-adjusted individual. She reacts with appropriate horror to things like Alice's finger collection and the crimes against nature that Emily calls pets. Gardenia is the Only Sane Woman.
The other variant is where the other characters aren't always that weird, but everyone save one character is acting weird in a particular situation. For example, they might regard something absurd as Serious Business, with the Only Sane Man the only one who notices how crazy that is.
This latter variant also includes a standard comedy piece: something absolutely insane is going on, but only one person notices (or cares). There are usually three stages, with a rough correspondence to the Five Stages of Grief: Bewilderment (Shock and Anger), trying to get others to see or admit the weirdness (Bargaining and Denial), and bitter sarcasm (Acceptance).
In the more extreme cases, the poor soul may be trapped in a World Gone Mad and/or wind up Giving Up on Logic in frustration. Sometimes, though, they are Not So Above It All. A character may also think of themselves as the Only Sane Man without proper justification.
A Too Dumb to Fool character may be the Only Sane Man, although he is likely to be less worked up about the failures of others to see than in most cases.
The Only Sane Man is often relied upon as the Only Sane Employee. This character often ends up a Knight In Sour Armor. For a more horrific version, see Through the Eyes of Madness. For the sci-fi version, the Ignored Expert is your go-to guy. The comedy version will often end up being either a Butt-Monkey or a Chew Toy. If all the other characters are otherwise sane, and really should see something, but only one guy does, he's an Einstein Sue. See also Cassandra Truth, Surrounded by Idiots, and Surrounded by Smart People; contrast with the Unfazed Everyman. May temporarily overlap with What the Hell, Hero?
If several characters take turns being the Only Sane Man, they're playing with a Sanity Ball. If it's a two-person show, with one person playing the Only Sane Man to the other's wackiness, it's a Straight Man and Wise Guy scenario. This trope is the savvy half of a Savvy Guy, Energetic Girl duo, one third of a Comic Trio, and part of the Four-Man Band.
Usually, but not always, a Cast Full of Crazy contains an Only Sane Man. Usually, he's prone to Sanity Slippage.
The Wonka may well feel like this (or be this!) in a world that doesn't follow his thinking. Insanity is, after all, in the eye of the beholder, and The Wonka often has quite valid points."
t16259,OOCIsSeriousBusiness,"The long form of the trope title is ""Out of Character Is Serious Business.""
Now, then. Some characters have strong traits that they are known by. This is for when characters momentarily break away from their normal habits to make a point about the seriousness of the situation. Often causes the other characters to do a Double Take and mention why this event is Serious Business. When most or all of these OoC moments happen at once, you can be sure that the world is ending, or at least the Darkest Hour, leading characters to behave in ways they normally wouldn't, because they know they might not have another chance to do so.
It's also a pretty good indication the Godzilla Threshold has been crossed.
This is a trope for when a somewhat-Out of Character action is used to draw extra attention to the scene (similar to a Title Drop). It isn't Hidden Depths because it isn't telling us something about the character we didn't already know; it's similar to an Out-of-Character Moment in that this is specifically the usage of such a moment to draw attention to a scene. If they're doing this deliberately to make another character think something is amiss, see Out-of-Character Alert. Compare Let's Get Dangerous! and Weirder Than Usual.

Often overlaps with:"
t16404,OurDemonsAreDifferent,"Demons. Devils. Fiends. They're all over the place in storyland, but no two authors portray them in exactly the same way.
Demons in western fiction tend, by default, to be of a vaguely Abrahamic nature, most often red or black with horns, hooves, and maybe a tail. They're generally found torturing the souls of those that wind up in Hell, making deals with mortals in order to claim their souls for the pit, and are usually on the side of Evil, often opposing Angels.
Demonic names are quite a bit looser than those for Angels, though in the west, they often take inspiration from Hebrew, biblical or mythological sources, as well as the Ars Goetia.
The prospective demon has many options available for customization:
There's no doubt about it. No matter what you choose, Your Demons Are Different.
Specific Types:
Series which have protagonists up to Demon Slaying especially rely on this trope, as the various ways a demon can be different can often determine how a demon hunter actually operates."
t16407,OurElvesAreBetter,"Elves are many different things to many different people, but it's important to remember the one thing elves always are: better. Better than you, me, and even other elves. Especially other elves.
They are also quite aware of that fact and will let you know it, again and again and you won't argue about it (most of the time). After all, they've quite often been around for a lot longer than those upstart humans. The flavor of this betterness will vary across stories and authors between all-natural, magical, or just plain nasty. Some of them might even be humble and will make sure you know about it.
It is exceedingly common for Elves to come in multiple breeds, all better than you in some way or another. Usually they'll come in an archetypal trinity, these garden varieties being:
Some common varieties beyond those three include:
All elves usually share the following traits:
This subject is prone to Internet Backdraft on RPG forums. Many see elves as only enjoyed by munchkins or those who wish to see themselves as better than everyone else in every facet, yet others claim that elves are above such things. Which, really, only makes things worse-can you really claim to be above being above people?
Their lack of facial hair and spiritual inclinations point at one of two main sources of inspiration — Magical Native Americans, or Celtic history and mythology. Of course, results of mixing even these two vary wildly depending on the writer's skill. In particularly egregious cases elven society can become a Mary Sue Topia.
Compare The Fair Folk, Screw You, Elves! (when you don't believe in their betterness), Christmas Elves (for the other kind of elf), Our Fairies Are Different, Witch Species.
Contrast Humans Are Special.
Whatever you do, don't mention the Dwarves."
t16447,OurVampiresAreDifferent,"Subtrope of Our Monsters Are Different. This one deals with everyone's favorite undead bloodsuckers.
The purpose of vampires in the story varies quite widely. They serve as the Big Bad or as a metaphor for something, be it addiction or denial of aging, or even communicable diseases like the plague or an STD. There is some danger of the vampire character being too on-the-nose for the metaphor.
The ""baseline rules"" below are strongly influenced by Hollywood tradition, and not ""real"" vampire folklore, or even classic vampire fiction. For instance, as (properly) shown in the 1992 Dracula with Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder, and in 2003's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Dracula and other ""folkloric"" vampires were at the most inconvenienced by sunlight, not killed instantly. More to the point, sunlight didn't cause vampires to go up like flash paper in the original novel, nor in earlier vampire lore. Sunlight causing a vampire to suffer pain and damage, burst out in glitter, smolder, or go up like a one-man pyrotechnic show was created by the movies, from Nosferatu (1922) and onward.
Modern vampire treatment in popular culture is usually divided into cycles. The Malignant cycle (1931 -1948), the Erotic cycle (1950 -1985), the Sympathetic cycle (1987 -2001), the Individualist cycle (2003- present day). Malignant, meaning vampires are treated as creatures of pure horror, as popular in the early films like Nosferatu, and Universal films. Erotic, meaning they were considered evil but alluring, such as the Hammer films. Sympathetic, meaning they were seen as tragic monsters that were to be pitied, but still feared, although they could sometimes be redeemed usually by becoming human once more. And Individualist meaning that they could be bad, good, or in between, much like humans, and their transformation to vampirism did not imply a change in morality.
The sheer number of different and contradictory myths that have built up around vampires over the years have made it difficult to explore all of them in great detail. To deal with this, writers have started putting multiple types of vampire into their setting, with the explanation that different myths describe different types of vampire.
Differences may be reinforced by spelling it ""Vampyre"", or using a clever synonym like ""nosferatu"" ""sanguinarian"" or ""strigoi"". The term comes from Serbian vampir (вампир). If the differences are emphasized by overt mocking of other authors and unused vampire tropes it becomes Your Vampires Suck.
A work will usually address these baseline rules even if they're not enforced. Sometimes an unused rule will be explained away as a Fake Weakness propagated by the vampires themselves.
""Blood mages"" may also qualify for this trope if they extract blood and are generally portrayed as similar to vampires.

t16635,PapaWolf,"Paternal instinct can transform a Bumbling Dad into an Action Dad. If someone threatens his kids they will soon wish they'd never come within a mile of them. This is because fathers are expected to take care of their family and this naturally extends to keeping them safe. Such occasions serve as a way for a father to prove his worthiness. (See A Real Man Is a Killer). Expect his children to have a newfound respect for their father and for them to brag that My Dad Can Beat Up Your Dad. If their relationship was previously strained expect it to improve.
Often Papa Wolf incidents serve as a way to reveal that a Non-Action Guy is really a Retired Badass or a Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass (or even a Retired Monster). In contrast to an Overprotective Dad (who sometimes thinks he's this; there is no overlap between them), a Papa Wolf is always portrayed heroically because the latter is defending their kids from genuine threats instead of imagined ones.
A Team Dad may display a streak of this, but the Papa is more likely to be related to his children by blood or through formal adoption, and the children tend to be younger, which may be part of why the Papa Wolf is more oriented toward protecting them rather than training them to defend themselves. However even completely grown children can summon this response in the face of crisis because they are still his children no matter how old or strong they get.
This is the Spear Counterpart to Mama Bear. When Mama Bear and Papa Wolf team up, no force on earth can stop them.
Subtrope of Beware the Nice Ones. See also A Father to His Men and Family Man. Combining this with Disproportionate Retribution can lead to a Knight Templar Parent. If the guy is a teacher instead, he's a Badass Teacher. If the guy doing this is a sibling/cousin, you get Big Brother Instinct. Inversely, see Parents in Distress for the kids rescuing the dad. Evil characters can use this too; after all, Even Evil Has Loved Ones. A subtrope of the Papa Wolf is the Badass and Child Duo, where an adult male badass takes it upon himself to protect an orphaned, unrelated young child. See also Cub Cues Protective Parent for examples from the animal kingdom, which might include a literal wolf.
Remember when adding examples that this is a male only trope. The female equivalent is ""Mama Bear"" so all Distaff Counterparts should be placed there. When Mama Bear and Papa Wolf team up, it's a Battle Couple and all pairs should be placed there. Parents in Distress is the inversion, when Papa needs to be bailed out by the kids.
Also, note that this is not the trope for being protective of one's friends, unless of course it is something like an Intergenerational Friendship. In that case, it is okay. Otherwise, don't do it. Tropes about helping friends should go to A Friend in Need, The Power of Friendship etc."
t16671,ParentalAbandonment,"A stunningly large number of heroes and their coteries are lacking in the parent department, either through death or in that they just aren't talked about. Even if both parents are alive, they may well be emotionally or physically distant (although that's just Parental Neglect). Everyone is, for the sake of the plot, Conveniently an Orphan, whether they actually are or not.
This is a very convenient way for characters to be able to run off in the middle of the night to fight Evil, get sucked into another world, etc. without having anyone responsible for them making a fuss. In fact, one of the first things a creator of stories about children or teens having adventures needs to do is explain a lack of parental involvement.
It also allows for the Ordinary High-School Student to be revealed as a super-powered demon fighter, or intergalactic being without the need for a messy Retcon answering the question an alert viewer would ask about why the parents didn't know about this. It's simply a case of the child following in their parents' Secret Legacy.
Of course, if you go back far enough, you'll reach a time when most young adults in Real Life actually were orphaned or abandoned. Adults died younger than they do now, and people with chronic illnesses like schizophrenia or tuberculosis were often sent away from the family to recover or die. It was also easier to abandon a family, given the poor communications of the times and the lack of a police force. Because of all this, it's quite common for a fictional character from the 19th century or earlier to mention being orphaned with no more emotional reaction than a shrug, since the experience was considered a normal part of real life. A good example is Jane Austen's Emma, where the title character's mother died years earlier, but is barely mentioned.
Note that the parents in question don't actually have to die for this Trope to be in effect. Note also that in a few cases listed below, parents are hardly even mentioned — which makes things incredibly awkward.
If only one parent is missing or dead, then it's a case of Missing Mom or Disappeared Dad. If the specifics of their absence aren't explained, they're an Ambiguously Absent Parent. When several siblings lack their original parents, the first born will receive a Promotion to Parent. Parental Abandonment is also a leading cause of Dark Magical Girls. One standard method for achieving it is to make your characters Blitz Evacuees.
In families with servants, this can lead to the Old Retainer acting as a Parental Substitute. If they were traveling abroad when both parents died, the child may be Raised by Natives. If the parents die in the wilds, their surviving child may be Raised by Wolves. It is also possible the parents left them out there to die, expecting them to be a meal, not an adoptee.
When the parents had to separate from the child in order to protect it, this results in Moses in the Bulrushes. When the parents had to leave the child in order to give it ""a better life"", then it leads to Give Him a Normal Life.
In animation, cases of parentis absentia can be caused by budgeting; it's cheaper to animate one character (usually Dad) than to have two characters basically doing the same thing.
Parental Abandonment is a common feature of a Dark and Troubled Past (though children lucky enough to find a Parental Substitute generally avoid such a fate). It is a common feature of a Tear Jerker.
It should be noted that parental abandonment does not always mean either or both parent(s) leaving, but also the child being ignored by the parent, knowingly or unknowingly.
May entail Tell Me About My Father. Or rarely, mother. For reasons of economy, the child is seldom interested in both parents. See also Parental Neglect, Hands-Off Parenting, Missing Mom, and Disappeared Dad. Parental Abandonment en masse may create a Teenage Wasteland.
Compare Free-Range Children when it's the children who voluntarily go out on their own accord. The reverse form is the Missing Child, but there can be interesting crossover: the child may seem to go missing because of the abandonment of/distance created by their parents, and the parents either don't notice or get concerned and finally realize they love their offspring.
For the opposing extreme, contrast Meddling Parents, My Beloved Smother, Overprotective Dad and Fantasy-Forbidding Father."
t16675,ParentalFavoritism,"It's tough being a kid in Fiction Land. Bad enough when you're an only child, but if you're among a pack of siblings, this particular trope is nearly guaranteed to raise its head at some point in order to make life even more difficult.
Parental Favoritism is just what it sounds like — one child is given preference over their siblings. In order to qualify, this has to be consistent. One child being asked to do the other's chores because their sibling is sick is not favoritism, although that won't stop the kid lumbered with the extra work from grumbling. One child having to do all the chores on a daily basis, while their brother/sister sits and plays video games is definitely favoritism.
It may show itself in a variety of ways. If there is an argument or fight, the parent(s) will always take the side of one particular sibling, and the other(s) will be the ones being scolded/punished. The parents may brag about one child in particular and be admonishing or dismissive of the others for their faults and regardless of the achievements of the brothers and sisters. A regular line that may be entailed with this is a variant of, ""Honestly, (insert name), why can't you be more like (insert favorite's name)?"" There may always be one particular kid who gets out of doing their chores, even if the other kids get pulled up for forgetting to tidy their room.
Sometimes, there may be more than one ""favorite,"" or the mother and father will have different ""favorites"", making life even more of a headache for their siblings.
There are a few different versions of the trope and a few different ""explanations"" as to why one child is preferred over the other. These divisions can be by:
Any of these criteria can backfire. For example, one child might be the favorite because they look and act just like their saintly, deceased mother. Another might be just the opposite — The Un-Favourite — because of their resemblance to the mother that walked out on the father — or even because they remind the father of the saintly mother. If the saintly mother died in childbirth, then the poor kid who was birthed this way usually has a hell of a lot of resentment to get over, no matter what the physical similarities, often due to the father, consciously or unconsciously, blaming him or her for the mother's death.
Occasionally, parents have a child that naturally requires more care and attention than the others, because they're very young, disabled, or psychologically damaged. This will still seem unfair to the other kids who get less of their parents' time, but it's a necessity rather than favoritism... usually. This is a favorite plot for children's books and television, where the lead character is jealous of a new baby sister or brother only to be reassured that ""we love you just as much."" On the other hand, if the favorite is Too Good for This Sinful Earth, the parents may never learn to appreciate their living children.
Sometimes, the parents are reasonably handing out the privileges and responsibilities with age. When the older child looks only at the responsibilities and the younger at the privileges, both can come to the view that they are The Un-Favourite. Or they may responsibly differentiate, but the musically untalented child may resent the lessons as favoritism, and the talented one, the other's free time as favoritism; or the child who must do all the chores resents the sickly child's confinement to his bedroom and inability to play. Cue Sibling Rivalry.
Of course, it is common that the parents are not aware of their favoritism and may be appalled at themselves upon realizing it. Very few parents would actually pursue favoritism with the knowledge of the other children's hurt feelings.
In fact, the obligatory ""talk with the parents"" is normally part of a Parental Favoritism plot...but that does not guarantee it will solve anything. If the writer is trying to Hand Wave the glaring bias of the parents, there will be a scene where mum and dad will give a long speech on how they value all their kids equally and will tell The Un-Favourite child that making them live in the basement and forcing them to bow whenever their sibling enters a room is really a mark of their esteem. The words ""you're the responsible one"" will be mentioned in some form. A more realistic version is where the big talk is honest, and the parent doesn't bother trying to justify their actions but do realise they were wrong and attempt to make amends. This is regularly done to ""humanise"" the hitherto parents — but it's too late. By the time of the talk, most of the audience will already be set against the parents, and it'll take a hell of a lot of good writing to redeem them. If the parents have clearly realized their foolishness and have shown to be really sorry, then this MAY take a lot of weight off them.
Parental Favoritism can have a huge impact on characters even when they become adults. The Favorite will either be spoiled and throw a tantrum if (s)he doesn't get his/her own way, feel that they were a sort of ""experimental"" child and develop insecurities, or be a Nervous Wreck who permanently fears that he or she won't meet the parents' expectations; kids at the bottom of the pecking order will usually be bitter and cynical about relationships and family life (and often blame the favorite children alongside the parents), or have serious self-esteem issues, leading to self-deprecation or clinginess as ways to compensate.
This is all too often Truth in Television. The friendship version of this trope is Friendship Favoritism."
t16677,ParentalIncest,"Something often depicted in media as much squickier than Brother–Sister Incest, Twincest or Kissing Cousins is incest between a parent and their child. Sigmund Freud had a lot to say about the Oedipus and Electra complexes, and could find subtext in quite a lot of places. But in Big Screwed Up Families, Deadly Decadent Courts, particularly abusive households and elsewhere, one is likely to find examples of this trope.
When this trope shows up in media, it's usually used to highlight the specific psychological issues that a character has, particularly if it features in the backstory of a Serial Killer or other psychopath, or to give an already nasty villain that extra bit of shudder factor. When the parent is the aggressor in the relationship, it is usually quite predatory in nature, and in many cases (particularly in the case of fathers and daughters), it's a crossing of the Moral Event Horizon when it's revealed. If the child is the aggressor in the relationship, it usually means he or she is seriously twisted in some way or in the very least has serious issues. Sometimes this is played for Black Comedy, particularly in the case of mothers and sons, with the son understandably freaked out due to the mother's advances.
This trope appears with step, foster, or adoptive parents as well as biological ones, sometimes to Bowdlerise it somewhat, although the power dynamics are still much the same as in parent/child incest. Wife Husbandry is one way to Bowdlerise it still further — though not out of Squick range.
This is a type of Unequal Pairing, since the parent is almost always at least psychologically if not always physically in a much more powerful position than the child. See also Rape as Backstory and Abusive Parents.
Also see Surprise Incest, where the couple involved do not know they're related, as well as Brother–Sister Incest, Creepy Uncle, and Kissing Cousins. When children innocently suggest this, it's Father, I Want to Marry My Brother. See Pervert Dad for parents who don't quite go this far, but still have an (un)healthy dose of weirdness. See I Love You, Vampire Son, when the ""parent"" is the vampire that sired his ""son""."
t16684,ParentalSubstitute,"An amazingly large number of children in the media suffer from Parental Abandonment. Other children are ""lucky enough"" to have both parents, but unfortunately live in worlds where there are no Happily Married families. For most such children, life is an endless series of disappointments and let-downs. A lucky few, though, manage to find a Parental Substitute.
A Parental Substitute is an adult friend who fills the children's lonely life with guidance and (often) love. They guide the child and teach them how to stand on their own feet, how to have fun, and how to not be so bothered by the fact that Mommy or Daddy are never around (or ignore them). If the parents in question are dead, they may have known them and are able to answer when the child says Tell Me About My Father. They often tell the kid they are So Proud of You. Usually, by the end of the story, the Parental Substitute leaves as well, but at that point the kid is able to stand on their own two feet.
This trope is often a feature of Tear Jerkers, especially if it follows Take Care of the Kids. If it's an older sibling who's taken over the parental role, that's Promotion to Parent. The Old Retainer may take over this role in event that his employer's children are suffering from Parental Abandonment. If an entire society has teens become parental substitutes, that's a Teenage Wasteland. If the child gets into a big argument with the substitute, expect to hear ""You're Not My Father"" by the time things get really heated.
Imaginary Friend is often involved. If the Parental Substitute decides to make their status official, as it were, the kid becomes Happily Adopted.
Compare and closely related to Promotion to Parent (when it's a sibling) and Adoptive Peer Parent (for non-relatives), Like a Son to Me, Team Mom, and Team Dad."
t16779,PayEvilUntoEvil,"The dark, logical corollary to The Golden Rule.
So the character descends upon the settlement, burns their buildings, kills the inhabitants, takes their money and resources, and leaves, pleased that now he'll be able to buy that shiny new whatever-he-was-wanting.
Is this the new Big Bad? No! It's The Hero! ... oh wait, did you know that it was a settlement of bandits? A more Wretched Hive of arsonists, murderers, and jaywalkers never blemished a countryside.
Welcome to a special kind of morality where otherwise evil actions are considered okay because the victims deserved it. Like all tropes, this can played with any number of ways. It can be played straight, defied, deconstructed, or left disquietingly gray depending on the author. This one's very common with Revenge stories in general, since revenge at its core is a viciously personal case of Paying Evil Unto Evil, and when one is broken to the core by the suffering brought by the evil, even a desperate Revenge by Proxy becomes justifiable (or at least it will seem that way to the one taking revenge). Alternatively, the hero may use such tactics as part of a deliberate and calculated strategy to break the villains' morale.
Expect an extra heavy Villain Ball complete with kicking dogs by the Asshole Victim if the author especially wants you to know it's okay. The plot often uses this with a ""people whom the law let get away"" Karma Houdini combination. The villain may call out a Not So Different speech to the ""hero"" as a final insult.
This sort of character often gains an Inspector Javert opponent, whose rightness depends from case to case.
It is also a common and effective way to give a Sympathetic P.O.V. to an Anti-Hero in works with Black and Gray Morality. In darker Crime and Punishment Series, this is often the reaction of the police department to Cop Killers (to the point of becoming Police Brutality).
And should a person has trouble doing this on their own, they can always ask for a helping hand.
If a victim of evil, or a Badass Pacifist, chooses not to Pay Evil Unto Evil, they may decide to Turn the Other Cheek. How effective either response is will depend on where the work falls on the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism.
Contrast with If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him, The Farmer and the Viper, and Kick the Son of a Bitch (when the victim in question isn't recognized by the person victimizing them for the bad things they've done; the lines may be blurred in cases where the person inflicting harm was, at the core, just looking for someone to hurt and decided to use the victim's scumminess as an excuse to harm them). Depending on the depiction, Hell may also serve as an extreme example, where those who do evil are punished forever with various torments you certainly wouldn't call good. May overlap with Disproportionate Retribution.
See also Vigilante Man, Just Like Robin Hood, Bully Hunter, Serial-Killer Killer, Unscrupulous Hero, Wife-Basher Basher, Karmic Thief, and He Who Fights Monsters.
In real life, the sort of thinking behind this trope is called ""retributive justice""."
t16904,PerspectiveFlip,"A subtrope of External Retcon, in which somebody takes a known — often classic — story, and retells it, turning it on its head. What you thought was the villain is now taken as a protagonist, and is portrayed with a greater degree of sympathy. The heroes of the story as best known might not come across so well in this telling.
Usually, the villain is presented as a smart, insightful, dedicated but tragically flawed character who may lack the charisma, empathy or social standing required to get support from other people and society in general, while the heroes are too naive, shortsighted or selfish to see the ultimate consequences of their ""heroic"" deeds. They may mean well, but as they say about the road to hell...
The complete inversion/reinterpretation (where the villain is the real hero and vice versa) is rarer, but in both cases, the impact of the story derives from the fact that we know who's supposed to be good and who's supposed to be bad, and this story upsets this. This is not the same as original stories on the extreme end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism, where everything is morally ambiguous and no characters can be said to be good or bad per se; here the writer is deliberately playing with our expectations.
Can overlap with Grimmification, but it doesn't have to be a fairy-tale, and Grimmification doesn't always feature a hero-villain flip. Doing this to a whole cosmology can lead to Satan is Good.
Expect a story like this to be Darker and Edgier in proportion to the original's simplicity as well as elements of deconstruction which kinda helps the whole story be told. Do keep in mind the possibility of an Unreliable Narrator, if this is done from the first person POV. Compare (and/or contrast) with ""Rashomon""-Style, Villain Episode, Sympathetic P.O.V., Humans Are Cthulhu, Lower-Deck Episode, Monster Adventurers, Another Side, Another Story, and P.O.V. Sequel.
May contain spoilers, both for the Perspective Flipped and original versions of a story. Not to be confused with Perspective Reversal."
t16933,PetTheDog,"This term was coined by screenwriters, basically meaning: show the nasty old crank petting a dog, and you show the audience, aw shucks, they're not that bad of a person after all. Often used to demonstrate that a Jerkass is really a Jerk with a Heart of Gold, or, if more limited, that the character is goal oriented rather than sadistic and/or thoroughly evil. If used as an Establishing Character Moment then you skip right past the jerkass phase.
Of course, this doesn't mean specifically petting a cute animal. It's just any attempt to soften the edge of a villain (or Anti-Hero) by showing him engaging in a moment of kindness, especially towards someone who can't do anything for them.
Sub Tropes include Even Bad Men Love Their Mamas, Morality Pet (a character's entire relationship with a villain is one long Pet The Dog moment), and Androcles' Lion (where the dog would later reward the one who petted him/her). Compare Licked by the Dog. A few ways to pet the dog include being an Anonymous Benefactor, I Was Just Passing Through, and Even Evil Has Standards. Demonstrating Moral Myopia could also work (if the people they favor aren't evil).
Contrast Kick the Dog (doing something evil to establish an evil personality, with many, many villains having both), Photo Op with the Dog (where it's all an act for the good publicity) Must Make Amends (when a character tries to undo or atone for having Shot The Dog), Bait the Dog (when this is darkly subverted). May overlap with Out-of-Character Moment if the character Pets A Dog they're usually mean to without a good explanation being given for their spontaneous kindness to them.
In modern Hollywood circles, this is also referred to as ""save the cat"", with the idea being that if you show your hero stopping to save a cat stuck in a tree as his Establishing Character Moment, you're putting the audience on his side forever."
t17357,PoorCommunicationKills,"According to many anthropologists, one of the turning points in human development was a growing ability to communicate. In fiction, one of the turning points in dramatic development is the inability to communicate.
In many stories, particularly those that rely on Dramatic or Tragic Irony, miscommunication and misunderstanding can often play a role in setting off or allowing bad things to happen. This often happens in mystery stories, such as where a murderer kills an innocent victim due to a misunderstanding, as well as in Tragedies, where poor communication is often the result of the characters' own Fatal Flaws, which lead them to commit Tragic Mistakes that pave the way for everything to go pear-shaped. This is also an all-too-common occurrence in Real Life, where many real life tragedies could have been avoided had the right people shared information that could have prevented them, but didn't for all kinds of reasons.
In order for this trope to work, the misunderstanding or miscommunication needs to have a reason to occur, best borne out of the natural characterization of the characters involved. A character who has a hard time trusting someone, for example, is more likely to dismiss that someone's explanation of what's going on out of hand than to hear the person out. Someone who is naturally shy or has No Social Skills may also have trouble getting their point across. A Horrible Judge of Character may implicitly trust a villain who wants nothing but bad things for him, and tend not to believe those who tell him of the villain's evil intentions. A Ditherer may refuse to speak up on something because it would mean having to make a choice one way or the other.
Basically, the miscommunication or misunderstanding should be borne out of flaws and behaviors that a character has had from the start rather than something that happened because the author needed a story to go a certain way and derailed the characters involved, making them hold the Idiot Ball. Alternately, if everyone in the story has unreasonably bad communication skills, it may be an Idiot Plot. Authors who pull this trope badly run the risk of straining the audience's Willing Suspension of Disbelief.
Though similar, this trope does not include things like Selective Obliviousness, You're Just Jealous, or Sarcastic Confession, as those are failures to listen rather than speak (though listening is also a vital part of good communication).
NOTE: though the trope name includes ""kills"", no death has to happen. It's a pun: ""poor communication skills"" and ""poor communication kills"" — death does sometimes happen as a result of poor communication.
Compare Dramatically Missing the Point; Open Mouth, Insert Foot; Impeded Messenger; Doomed Appointment.
Contrast: Just Eat Gilligan, Amnesia Danger. See Facial Dialogue for those times in which a character seems unable to communicate, but actually can get entire encyclopedias of information across with just body language and a twist of the eyebrow. When communication is impeded not by character flaws but because of an outside force, see Impeded Communication.
Works using this trope will often discuss The Power of Language.
This is a trope rife with major plot points by necessity. Spoilers shall be unmarked."
t17441,PosthumousCharacter,"A character, dead from the start or killed very early in a work, who is either depicted as The Ghost (not literally) or developed entirely via flashbacks. May make heavy use of Posthumous Narration. Averts We Hardly Knew Ye. Video Wills, Apocalyptic Log, suicide notes, and mention by other characters on what he or she was like may help.
Expect them to appear in a Happier Home Movie, which the protagonist will watch over and over until he realizes It's All Junk.
The Afterlife may be used as a Framing Device.
The Lost Lenore is often such a character. Undead characters don't count. The effect should be that, despite a character being, you know, DEAD, they still have as large a part in what's going on as the rest of the characters, or at the very least results in the viewer getting to know the character surprisingly well.
Generally this character's demise is a Plot-Triggering Death. Compare with Dead Star Walking and Dead All Along. Contrast with Forgotten Fallen Friend. See also Death by Origin Story. The Predecessor Villain is often a specific type of Posthumous Character. Greater-Scope Villain can be a villain version of this trope, depending on how it's used. Starts with Their Funeral can lead to this trope if the dead character is shown in flashbacks."
t17579,PrecisionFStrike,"A Precision F-Strike is when a character suddenly swears in an uncharacteristically strong manner, or when a swear is unexpectedly used in a work with mild language. It's usually intended to show that shit just got real serious.
Another variant is when a movie limits its swearing in order to keep from getting an R rating, and so is forced to place it very strategically. If a movie uses the F word more than two or three times or in a sexual or aggressive way, it can easily get an R rating. If it's used up to two or three times, each in a non-sexual context, it usually stays PG-13 so long as it lacks any other content that would warrant an R rating. As such, the writers will only have the characters curse when it actually means something.
Also, when Unusual Euphemism is normally in play in a work, having ""real"" oaths appear can have the same effect.
Due to the nature of language, this trope is prone to Values Dissonance about what words are appropriate. ""Bloody"", ""cunt"", ""ass"" and ""twat"", just to name a few words, have very different connotations on the two sides of the Atlantic—and that's just the differences within a single language. Although, like many other English words, the word ""fucking"" exists with only a minor variation in German (""ficken""), it's only used as a verb and almost never as a curseword. The word ""Scheiße"" (""shit"") and its variations are almost always used in exactly the same way as the word ""fuck"" in English. In many European countries, swearing is rarely considered an issue when it comes to film ratings—for example, Silver Linings Playbook, which has about seven dozen F words, was rated ""tous publics"" (equivalent to the MPAA's ""G"") in France, and children as young as six could watch it in the Netherlands.
In some languages, however, expletives do not actually exist, or are so uncommonly used and/or offensive that they are not allowed in the media. Seemingly equivalent words may be used similarly, but without the impact of an actual expletive (for example, although the Japanese word kuso is translated as ""shit"", its profanity level is more along the lines of ""crud"" and is often used in children's shows by child characters without raising alarm). These languages may have levels of politeness which serve the same purpose (again, Japanese), and translations often take advantage of the dub/sub language's expletives to give the same feeling. For subtitles, this crosses over into Spice Up the Subtitles, unless the expletive used by the translator actually is said in the original dialogue, as is known to happen.
Note that when using this trope in the context of the quote, DON'T attach it to every single time said quote contains ""fuck"", ""shit"", etc. This trope IS applicable if it's for a case of unusually strong swearing or of the party that uttered the quote isn't exactly known to be dirty-mouthed.
This trope is an intersection of Sophisticated as Hell and Conservation of Ninjutsu; related to O.O.C. Is Serious Business. May overlap with Atomic F-Bomb for extra emphasis. Compare Minor Insult Meltdown, Quote Swear Unquote, This Is for Emphasis, Bitch!.
Contrast with the Cluster F-Bomb and Gosh Dang It to Heck!.
Due to the nature of the trope, the following examples will contain swearing. Please don't be a fucking Bluenose.
General phrases include:"
t17675,PrettyLittleHeadshots,"Whenever someone gets shot in the head on TV, what generally happens is that they end up with a little hole in their head - and that's generally it. There may be a little blood on the wall behind them, implying a fairly gory exit wound, but not one you're likely to see.
In Real Life, a headshot virtually never leaves a neat little exit wound (the entrance wound may, however, be very ""neat"" in appearance). There is either no exit wound at all (the result of a low-powered or small round), or a pretty serious chunk of the skull is blown away by the exiting bullet (high-powered or large caliber bullets or a close-in shotgun blast). If the round doesn't exit the skull, the blood will be mostly around the entry wound, with possibly a bit of spatter if the victim jerked or twitched. If there is an exit wound, there's going to be bits of bone, brains and blood (and maybe teeth) all over. Often it's implied that the neat little hole we're seeing is the entry wound, and You Do NOT Want to Know what it looks like from the other side — sometimes this will be lampshaded in order to keep the gore down while at least paying lip service to the messy reality.
Generally subverted in video games, where anything bigger than a pistol has the capacity to cause obvious damage. The head usually still remains intact, though.
Contrary to popular belief, a gunshot wound to the head is not actually always fatal in and of itself, nor is it an Instant Death Bullet. Probably the most famous example of this was the head wound of Phineas Gage, who managed to survive a three foot long steel rod through his brain (not without ill effects though). For more details, see the Analysis page
This sort of head shot has a startling tendency to occur exactly in the center of the forehead, especially when it would be startling, unlikely, or even impossible to hit there.
It's generally a holdover from the days when Bloodless Carnage was the rule, and is still often used to avoid getting a more restrictive rating than the producers of the show want.
Has nothing to do with Pretty Little Liars (unless, of course, there's gunplay going on).
See also Bloodless Carnage, Magic Bullets, Moe Greene Special and Boom, Headshot!. Contrast Pink Mist. This is very unlikely to happen if the victim Ate His Gun."
t17690,PrideBeforeAFall,"A character is introduced as an insufferable jerk; arrogant because of some amazing talent or high station in life. Everyone hopes, as soon as he's introduced, that he's going to eventually get what's coming to him...
...and then he does. Immediately. Right at the start of the story. The character is overthrown and knocked out of that high station; or has his marvelous talents somehow taken from him, and spends the rest of the story learning to cope, with varying levels of success.
That's right, this trope begins with his fall from a position of power or influence to learn An Aesop, rather than giving him his due late in the story. Alternatively, we may meet the character just after his fall from power, and learn about his stuck-up, careless past and subsequent karmic punishment via Flash Back. The story spends just enough time showing the audience (or, if the writers are in a hurry, telling us) that he's an arrogant bastard to convince us, before knocking him off his high horse.
The major conflict of the story usually involves the character learning to be humble. Or at the very least, learning not to indignantly ask everyone he runs into ""Do you KNOW who I AM?!"" as he is often, despite being hit over the head with the humility stick, still very interested in continuing his thoughtless ways.
The story arc completes with character accepting the Aesop. The Aesop can vary, but a typical lesson would be how dependent on other people he is, and how other people need to depend on him. With this change of character, the arc may continue to his return to a power as a juster, kinder soul.
On a cultural or setting level see Look on My Works, Ye Mighty, and Despair!, Soiled City on a Hill, and And Man Grew Proud.
May overlap with Fallen Princess and Tragic Hero. Compare with The Atoner (who is necessarily repentant by definition), Break the Haughty (for a slower descent), A Taste of Power (for when this happens in video games), and Third Act Stupidity (when near the end of a story). Compare Jerk-to-Nice-Guy Plot.
If you're looking for pride before a literal fall, see Disney Villain Death."
t17855,ProudWarriorRaceGuy,"A specific subtrope of Blood Knight, the Proud Warrior Race Guy seeks battle and bloodshed because his culture teaches that doing so is the greatest source of personal honor and glory. This Proud Warrior Race will often be based on one of several real world cultures who are perceived to have acted this way, such as the Samurai, Spartans, Vikings, and Mongols. They are often a Martyrdom Culture. The Proud Warrior Race Guy is almost always a hero. If evil, he will probably be the Worthy Opponent.
""Proud"", in this case, often means ""Psychopathically Violent"". Critiques of this position will be met with: ""You do not understand"". May occasionally overlap with the Always Chaotic Evil race, though the two are usually differentiated by the Proud Warrior having a strict Code of Honour (which may include paying debts, loyalty to companions and officers, and fighting with honor), while the Chaotic Evil race has no real rules and does cowardly or underhanded things. If the Code of Honour is too alien for humans to understand, or too xenophobic to allow cooperation, then the heroes will treat the two groups as the same. The better sort of Code of Honour will enforce Would Not Shoot a Civilian, although often because civilians are dismissed as too weak and cowardly to be good fighters, and so they get passed over in the search for worthy enemies.
While most commonly seen in science fiction programs in the guise of Rubber-Forehead Aliens, the Proud Warrior Race Guy is not limited to that genre. Consider Hawk in Spenser For Hire, B.A. in The A-Team, and Tonto in The Lone Ranger or Kato in The Green Hornet. This trope currently tends to be limited to SF because applying it to human races really skirts the bounds of current racial sensitivities. You don't see a lot of the Noble Savage anymore either, except as alien races, for the same reason.
One variant to this might be a Proud Hunter Race Guy, such as the Predator, clad in bones and skulls with a head mounted on a spear. Just replace the aforementioned 'battle and bloodshed' with 'worthy prey and trophies,' and replace the large scale wars and battlefields with extended hunts in the jungle or swamp. These types tend to be The Stoic, since hunting requires one to be quiet when stalking prey. Individuals of this variant might be the Hunter Trapper, Scarily Competent Tracker, The Beastmaster, or Stealth Expert when compared to other versions of this trope, but will generally speak and behave extremely similarly. Species that are essentially aliens/creatures based on predatory animals, such as the Cat Folk or Lizard Folk often found in many Science Fiction and Fantasy works, are apt to be of this type because of the connotation between them and their predatory animal inspiration. This variant is also one of the few ways to play the Egomaniac Hunter trope straight while also allowing it to be a heroic figure.
Another variation on this is the Proud Soldier Race Guy — a more low-key version more like a military society rather than a warrior culture, with more focus on drilling and discipline than just strength at arms. These guys have a tendency to be more technologically advanced and more focused on expansion than conquest — they don't see the harm in dishonorable tactics, but they're pragmatic, not ruthless; The Proud Soldier Race Guy isn't likely to cause any more harm than absolutely necessary to get what he wants. Often ruled by The Emperor.
There are, in fact, a number of Humans Through Alien Eyes-type works where humans are the Proud Warrior Race (there is also a significant portion of these works in which the aliens see us that way, regardless of whether or not it's actually true).
See also Blood Knight and Barbarian Tribe. See Warrior Poet for what happens when the Proud Warrior Race Guy becomes more developed. Often is fond of being In Harm's Way, and is a Glory Seeker wanting to be Famed In-Story. They often are of the mistaken belief that this means they have a Badass Army, but often are proven wrong. May be from a Martyrdom Culture and worship a War God. Frequently crossed with or has strong elements of the Noble Savage. Being a culture singularly focused on the warrior way, anyone performing non-warrior roles frequently suffer from Klingon Scientists Get No Respect. If they manage to conquer another nation, can become members of a Foreign Ruling Class.
Also compare Proud Scholar Race Guy and Proud Merchant Race for different kinds of hats a species can wear.
If humanity is portrayed as the Proud Warrior Race, it's Humans Are Warriors."
t17875,PsychicPowers,"The ability to alter (or remotely observe) reality, directly tied to the mind/brain of the character. This is a specific form of Magic by Any Other Name, where the magic is named for some pseudoscientifical relationship with the caster's mental powers. Psychic, Psion, Mentalic, Mentalist, Parapsychologist, there's dozens of names for these people whose minds are able to sense and/or manipulate reality on a level that has yet to be proven to exist in Real Life.
Their powers are supernatural, but the names are (often) scientifically based, making it useful for Science Fiction stories across the spectrum. In general, the more powerful and dramatic the psychic, the softer the science. Creators may try to build Minovsky Physics for their psychic abilities, usually by detailing brainwaves and electroencephalogramsnote electric brain graph (also known as an EEG). Linking brainwave activity to the psychic abilities can reduce or eliminate use of No Conservation of Energy, which is otherwise part of the standard interpretation of psychic powers. The presence of psychics is accepted in a broad range of Speculative Fiction situations, not just sci-fi storytelling. Any genre may borrow a few psychics without being considered ""too sci-fi"", including otherwise realistic Slice of Life stories, implying its presence in Real Life as well.
Psychic abilities can be generalized into two categories; receptive and projective. The Parapsychological Association divides them into psi-gamma and psi-kappa. Receptive abilities are purely internal, displaying no external evidence they're being used apart from the occasional Psychic Nosebleed (and of course, the stance). The ability to see the future is receptive; the character gains knowledge with no external mechanic. Projective abilities affect the external world, requiring acting or special effects to reflect the way these abilities manipulate reality. The ability to move physical objects is projective; the character affects an external object with no tangible connection between them. Naturally there is overlap; Telepathy is receptive in that the character gains knowledge from another's mind, and usually projective by allowing the character to implant thoughts/ideas into the other character as well. For a full list of psychic powers, read the Analysis subpage.
Although psychic abilities are Magic by Any Other Name, they can also exist alongside other types of ""magic"", with some sort of division between two styles of Functional Magic. Even a work with only psychic ""magic"" may have more than one category of psychic abilities, which leads to Unequal Rites; characters with psychic abilities are prejudiced against each other based on their training philosophy, which powers they have access to, and/or how the powers were gained. Many psychic abilities can also be replicated by sufficiently advanced technology. Characters may be divided on if psychic abilities are scientific, or if psychic abilities are fantastical elements in an otherwise realistic setting (despite said ""realistic"" setting possibly containing werewolves and fairies)."
t17911,PublicDomainArtifact,"A famous, often completely mythical, conveniently uncopyrighted-yet-instantly-recognizable item, pulled from the realms of history, literature, or legend (if not all three).
Examples of this trope pop up frequently, and have occurred in any number of genres — comedy, drama, science fiction, historical fiction, fantasy, you name it. They can be spotted in cultures from the East to the West — and some date back surprisingly far. Some cultures have favorite items to use, such as the Holy Grail for the West or the Ame-no-Murakumo for Japan, but with modern globalization trends, we're seeing more and more stories pulling from others' usual lists — such as Japanese media like Neon Genesis Evangelion using the Lance of Longinus (a fabled item involved in the Crucifixion of Jesus).
It can be a weapon, a MacGuffin, or hell, maybe both if it's a mystical doomsday device. Sometimes the trope shows up as Imported Alien Phlebotinum (seen often, for example, in Stargate SG-1), sometimes it's a mystical object, and occasionally it's both. Sometimes startling revelations are to be had about the object, sometimes it's straight out of the legends, heck, maybe it's even reconstructed from the original's spare parts. Regardless of its distinguishing features in the story, though, what makes it a Public Domain Artifact is its origin as an item from the collective myths of man, with all their familiar symbols.
There's honestly no telling how long this trope has been around; while nowadays it's often used partly to avoid copyright infringement, it's been around much longer than the concept of copyright. Many authors (ancient and modern alike) have used these for the mythos attached to them, or simply because it's easier than inventing something out of whole cloth; if an author puts a supposedly mythical sword in their work, it needs to be supported, but when you hear ""Excalibur,"" it doesn't take any explanation to understand how important it is. See the example of Durandal below, Sword of Hector... then Roland... then reforged for Ogier the Dane. Later authors namedropped former heroes to make their mystical artifacts even more mystical, making this Older Than Feudalism.
In a series set in another world, these may appear, but under different names. They often function as a Plot Coupon; sometimes even entire sets of such artifacts will be used like this, leading to Gotta Collect Them All. In modern series, many of these items are made of low-grade unobtainium, especially if magic is downplayed or completely absent.
There's about a one-in-three chance that Hitler either had it or was searching for it. As the book Angels of Light and Darkness put it: ""If Hitler had half of what they say he had, he would have won the war.""
May be related to Alternate Landmark History. Frequently involved with an Historical In-Joke or instance of Been There, Shaped History. If weapons, they are almost certainly Named Weapons and examples of Stock Weapon Names.
See also: Stock Unsolved Mysteries, particularly for items with alleged connections to historical figures or events (especially with religious figures such as Jesus or the Buddha).

t17984,PurpleProse,"There are times within the life of any teller of tales (not including the Private Eye Monologue that Film Noir is so fond of) in which they are faced with a situation not most dire but not far removed: the writing, while not lacking in such delightful virtues as a sturdy coherent plot or rich characterization, is supremely dry and uninteresting to read.
In response, the writer chooses to indulge in the writing technique known to gentlefolk as Purple Prose, wherein the writing becomes much more florid, eschewing quotidian sentences for elaborate concatenation of phrases and clauses. On occasion, such racks of ornament can be despicable, with the scintillating adjectives bewildering the reader and obfuscating the subject.note Even looking words up in a dictionary doesn't always help; perpetrators of purple prose are notorious for Malapropism, especially when they trust their thesauri. In the worst case scenario, such prose will reduce readers to skim-reading for fear of trudging through pages and pages of mundane description slowly and painfully, just as violet-tinted patches on a garment incompatibly hued are agonizing for a human being's photon detectors.
The writing style is named after a quote by Roman poet Horace (65-8 BC, making this Older Than Feudalism), who compared writing such prose to sewing purple patches to clothing. This practice was a common means to show pretentiousness in wealth since purple dye was an expensive rarity. ""Purple Patches"" is used when the writer only occasionally breaks into purple, like scintillating arrays of diamonds appearing incongruously in mire, which can make much of the text more readable but less consistent, so the reader is jolted from one style to the other. (Consistent purple prose at least lets the reader get into the swing of things.)
Several excellent examples, things of beauty and confusion, can be found on the quotes page. This trope does not cover works in a florid but not intrusive style — the sacrifice of Utility on the altar of Eloquence is an essential feature of Purple Prose. It should also be noted that Purple Prose usually pairs flamboyant vocabulary with fairly plain grammar (that can get outright primitive in extreme cases) which differentiates it from true Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness. Bear in mind that Tropes Are Tools. Some of the examples below are intentional: the Purple Prose is a stylistic choice, a comedic turn or in aid of characterisation.
Compare contrastingly with the phenomenon given the appellation of Beige Prose. Seek furthermore the silicon entries known as: Walls of Text, Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness, and Meaningless Meaningful Words. Mills and Boon Prose is a Sub-Trope; furthermore, that affliction known as Said Bookism is a customary peculiarity of this mode of communication. Some communications open on the traditional Dark and Stormy Night. When narrators characterise their visual appearance via a Description in the Mirror, the resultant prose oftentimes can be purple. See also Name That Unfolds Like Lotus Blossom, for when this is applied to names."
t18160,RaisingTheSteaks,"Sometimes the Zombie Apocalypse, not unlike the bird flu, can carry to other species.
Yes, occasionally even dead animals can be revived into shambling monstrosities after human flesh. This can reach such levels of ridiculousness as (as suggested by the title) meat animating itself and moving around.
In video games, these animals are often also an example of Night of the Living Mooks, but not always.
In works where zombie humans have Zombie Gait, for some reason animals almost never move slower. If anything, they might even get a speed or strength bonus. Can in some cases be justified when zombification reduces brain function, as it takes more dexterity for a biped to run without falling over. Can also be justified in that the zombie plague causes the higher brain functions to cease, while the animal part of the brain keeps functioning. If the subject's ALREADY an animal, then there's no hindrance. Likewise, the fact that zombies don't get tired may work in a reanimated animal's favor, as many living carnivores are sprinters, unable to sustain high speeds for long.
See also Non-Human Undead for non-humanoid undead other than normal animals, such as Dracolich for zombie dragons."
t18201,RapeAsBackstory,"A popular way to establish a character as having a motivation for their depression, angst, distrust of others, and other anti-social tendencies is to have the revelation that he or she was raped at some point in his or her past. The overwhelming majority of characters given this treatment are female, but there are still cases of male characters, although even that is predominantly by other men. While it's perfectly possible to use this trope well, when done poorly the rape is only referenced when the victim wants sympathy - mostly from their sexy new true love. In other factors of their lives, it has little impact. However in Real Life, the trauma of rape can haunt somebody for the rest of their lives and recalls - which can be brought on for as small a reason as being alone in a room with the opposite gender - can make trusting future partners incredibly difficult. It's professional therapy, not sex with your true love, that brings relief.
""Ordinary"" male-on-female rape, on the contrary, is extremely common in bad fanfiction. What better justification could your Sympathetic Sue have for her boundless angst than having been raped in her past? If given almost no weight to the story, then it's been handled very badly.
There is Truth in Television to this trope, considering that rape is an extremely traumatic event and can cause serious mental illness and psychological repercussions. The fact that some writers use it to cheap effect for drama is not thought of highly. See also Child by Rape and Promiscuity After Rape."
t18205,RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil,"In many works of fiction, especially situations of Rape as Drama, rape is not merely bad; it's a qualitatively different level of evil. As such, a rape scene can be used as a Kick the Dog moment for a particularly evil character, or as the point where a character who previously was merely unlikeable crosses the Moral Event Horizon into monster territory.
Note that not only is rape considered a game changer for almost all characters, but it is also so for the writer. Many stories and Crapsack Worlds have monsters who don't commit rape, even though everything about their character indicates they could, would, or should. There are also times when rape is kept ""off camera"" or otherwise something in the past, or hinted at once and never brought up again. Having rape in a story will immediately plunge it into the darkest and edgiest abyss of all that is Darker and Edgier. If they don't portray the rape as dark enough, then Values Dissonance (and thus the most scathing criticism from the audience) will happen.
A sub-trope of Even Evil Has Standards when rape disgusts a villain. Compare Wouldn't Hit a Girl, Wouldn't Hurt a Child. Contrast Black Comedy Rape. Related to the idea of rape as a Fate Worse than Death. When refusal to engage in this is a sign of the good guys superiority it is The Women Are Safe with Us.
Woe betide a rapist who is caught by a Wife-Basher Basher: The results are NOT pretty."
t18297,RealityEnsues,"Somebody thought they were protected by the power of narrative convention. Then reality ensued.
By definition, fiction is unrealistic. But most of those who indulge in media don't ask for their stories to be completely like reality. As long as things are kept internally consistent, an audience is willing to go along with just about anything an author can create... no matter how irresponsible, immoral, or unhinged their more likeable and sympathetic characters might be acting by the standards of Real Life. For that reason, a creator can sometimes ignore or Hand Wave consequences of the real world in their stories. This trope, though, is about what happens when a creator chooses not to ignore said consequences, and even factors them in as part of the plot or events.
This can sometimes be seen on the hard end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism, though it isn't necessarily so since realism, despite what many claim, is not the same as cynicism. There are many realistic stories that run on optimism.
Generally, this trope is not used in order to make fiction completely and entirely mirror mundane everyday life... except when it is. This is also surprisingly often used as a Comedy Trope. Contrast Fantasy All Along, when reality ensues and immediately afterwards fantasy kicks in again (occasionally undoing the damage done by the ""reality"" moment).
Note that, when we say ""reality"", we mean reality as in Real Life. We have ""X happens"" and ""Y happens as a consequence of X""; the Y must not involve the fantastic in-story aspects of the work's own universe. For realistic consequences of unrealistic superpowers, see Logical Weakness.
The Extraordinary World, Ordinary Problems trope is a variant. Also related to Deconstruction and Deconstructive Parody, and is mainly used for comedy.note The difference between this trope and Deconstruction is the outcome, oddly enough - where deconstruction goes for a logical and realistic outcome under the rules employed (say ""magic exists"" + ""some people are crazy/evil"" = ""fireball-throwing maniacs using magic to commit crime""), as mentioned this trope goes for a logical and realistic outcome under Real Life rules, i.e. ""magic does not exist"" and people believing it does are just weirdoes.
Not to be confused with Hilarity Ensues, although when done right, the two can and will overlap. Still, do note that this is not strictly a ""humor"" trope: the defiance of a fantastic element can be a pretty powerful tool for deconstructive drama and sometimes even horror.
Characters who use this to their advantage almost invariably are Genre Savvy. A Wrong Genre Savvy character has chances to be hit hard by an Ensuing Reality. The No-Nonsense Nemesis runs entirely on this trope played for drama and sometimes horror. Violates No Ontological Inertia when things do not automatically change because one thing comes to an end.
Since this trope is entirely about outcomes happening under the rules of Real Life, real life examples would be redundant. If you want more detailed information on this, see Television Is Trying to Kill Us, a detailed list of why many different fiction tropes would not only not work out well in real life, but will end in disaster for anyone who actually attempts to do it.
Warning: As this trope frequently occurs at the climax of a work, spoilers are likely to be unmarked. Caution advised."
t18316,ReallyGetsAround,"A character who is well known for how easy they are. For sexual contact, that is. This trope is a Double Standard writ large: when a male character sluts it up, he's usually The Casanova, Kavorka Man, Chivalrous Pervert, or maybe an Accidental Pornomancer if they are innocent and aren't actively seeking it out. When a woman does it, time for the most insulting and aggressive adjectives, with ""Really Gets Around"" as a euphemism.
This sometimes overlaps with being evil, but is also a staple of sitcoms where it's more used as a simple source of humor. Jokes will usually play on her astonishing number and variety of partners. Often described as man-hungry, easy, loose or fast. In a more rural setting, she is often branded the ""village bicycle"" (been everywhere and everyone's had a ride...). Expect generous quotations from the Comic Sutra.
Compare Good Bad Girl. Also, Lady Drunk frequently claims to have been one of these in her youth. Sometimes overlaps with Ms. Fanservice. May be Fan Disservice for some.
Anything That Moves is a subtrope, and one of the few cases where a male character will typically be portrayed badly for it. An Ethical Slut is a specific, more modern subtrope which isn't portrayed negatively. Extreme Omnisexual is related, for characters that are more than bisexuals. See also Everybody Has Lots of Sex for cases where this Trope more-or-less applies to the entire cast of a work.
In Real Life, this is always a subjective topic with lots of Double Standard issues. In the words of couple’s therapist Esther Perel, ""Even under the cloak of anonymity, gender stereotypes persist. Men are socialized to boast, exaggerate, and overrepresent their sexual exploits, while women minimize, deny, and underrepresent theirs."" What is true for men also goes for politicians, Hollywood actors, rock stars, sport stars and other media celebrities. Power and wealth eroticize, so they will attract more groupies and lusting fans. On the other hand their reputations are often exaggerated in the popular press or by themselves. The celebrities will be depicted as Bigger Is Better in Bed or sexual supermen/women while most of them are in reality not that well endowed or that exceptionally great in bed. Similarly most of them are too preoccupied with their jobs, family, traveling and other stuff to be constantly making out. Many rock stars are too exhausted after a concert to immediately get it on with their groupies, for instance.
Even though this trope can be Truth in Television for some very attractive people, most of the time the amount of sex they have is grossly exaggerated. If you believe some people, they have sex every day of the week and not only that: it's always a satisfying experience. As the old saying goes: Money and sex are the topics people lie about the most. The only real people who, without a doubt, undeniably really get around are prostitutes and porn actors."
t18319,ReallySevenHundredYearsOld,"You're as old as the stars themselves and might possess the power to destroy them. While some entities like you might enjoy terrorizing others and warping their minds with improbable non-Euclidean frames, you prefer to be a bit more... subtle in your interactions with humans. Or you might have a good reason for not wanting your powers and potential to be immediately obvious.
And what better way is there to hide your identity and throw off suspicion than by taking on the form of a perky high school student?
An extreme version of Older Than They Look, Really 700 Years Old covers ancient, perhaps immortal beings, and (usually) the total opposite of Really Was Born Yesterday. Subjective age only—a form of suspended animation alone does not count. Elves tend to fall into this trope quite a bit in modern fantasy in part because their Beauty Is Never Tarnished. Same with Vampires and other undead subspecies who are unaging/dying beings who get to keep their mind and body. If it's purely artistic rather than biological, it's Artistic Age. For characters who look far younger than they are, but haven't yet lived longer than a human possibly could (say, an 80 year-old woman who looks 20), they're Older Than They Look. See also Immortality Begins at 20, Not Growing Up Sucks. For the really, really extreme version, see Time Abyss. Optimistic characters will say this trope is sweet.
For ways in which works show off that a character is Really 700 Years Old, see Exposition of Immortality."
t18354,ReasonableAuthorityFigure,"Heroes like the Ignored Expert have a hard enough time dealing with idiotic peasants, but their deepest problems invariably come from the antagonistic local authorities, who are dead set on ignoring their warnings and running them out of town because it's politically expedient. This makes the existence of the Reasonable Authority Figure all the rarer.
Fully aware that Machiavelli Was Wrong, he'll listen to those ""crazy kids"" when they say there's a fugitive nearby, and logically consider their arguments instead of dismissing them outright. However, their openness to the heroes' ideas doesn't mean they'll follow Agent Mulder's crazy ideas blindly. Often, they'll ask for proof and facts rather than follow baseless accusations, but even then, they'll usually humor the heroes and go check out their theories; whether it pans out or turns into a dead end depends on how far along the story is.
Usually Lawful Good and the person characters must Bring News Back to. They are the chain of command that goes past the basic Command Roster. The Rebellious Rebel is motivated by loyalty to him.
Noteworthy because, if the hero does manage to convince them, they can help in the fight but they may have to Shoot the Dog as part of their position. Being in a position where you are responsible for millions and do not think that A Million Is a Statistic can be hard.
May present The Hero and his companions with valuable gifts before The Quest or as a reward afterward.
This position means that they can end the story quickly unless other obstacles intervene. Which means they usually do intervene.
A common subversion is to have this character turn out to be the Treacherous Advisor. Sometimes, also, they will merely have a Treacherous Advisor, and be undermined because they listen to him too much.
It should be noted that a reasonable authority figure isn't somebody who simply says yes to all of their subordinate's requests. It may be that they have a good reason to deny a request, perhaps because it would interfere with the big picture and throw off some other more important task that must be completed, or that there is a morally ambiguous situation and while he has sympathy for his subordinate's position he can't agree with it due to conflicting ethics. This often crops in To Be Lawful or Good situations. It may also be that while he personally believes his staff when they come to him with an outlandish story, he's aware that his own superiors may not and would require proof, and therefore must refuse their requests on that basis. Conversely a leader who lets his subordinates do whatever they please may not be a good leader at all, but may be completely ineffectual, or even possibly malevolent, for example by making his subordinates so loyal to him that they willingly and eagerly hurl themselves into situations for him that more guarded people would realise were insane. In other words, a reasonable authority figure doesn't always have to support his underlings if he has good reasons not to, and somebody who does always back his subordinates up isn't always a reasonable authority figure.
The type's opposite is Head-in-the-Sand Management. Also contrast the Clueless Boss, who means well but is desperately out of touch with things in his own organization and possibly incompetent. If male, the Reasonable Authority Figure may be The Patriarch and A Father to His Men, or Da Chief, or a Benevolent Boss. If female, the Reasonable Authority Figure may be an Iron Lady or The High Queen.
In school-type shows featuring the Sadist Teacher (or possibly a strict dean or vice-principal), it's usually the principal that fills this role. Mind you, sometimes this is just elaborate Good Cop/Bad Cop.

t18443,RedemptionEqualsDeath,"Often, when a character who has done something bad or evil sees the error of their ways and does a Heel–Face Turn in the course of fighting to undo the damage, their redemption comes at the cost of their own life.
There are any number of reasons that authors do this:
The Death Seeker and some types of the Martyr Without a Cause are characters most prone to believe this in-universe. A possible end result of the Redemption Quest.
Compare Villain's Dying Grace when the villain is portrayed sympathetically as they are dying, Death Equals Redemption for when a dying villain chooses to do a final good act and Alas, Poor Villain when the character's death (speech) provides a reason for the fans to feel sorry for them. See also Heel–Face Door-Slam, when the poor guy doesn't even get to redeem themself before dying. Non-protagonist atoners are especially likely to be hit by this trope. See Forgiveness Requires Death when death is the only way for a character to earn forgiveness for a crime.
Naturally, this is a Death Trope. Expect unmarked spoilers ahead. You have been warned."
t18448,RedemptionQuest,"Maybe your character was The Cape, but fell on bad times. Maybe he was an Anti-Hero who made a mistake and went flying off the slippery slope. They could even be a Villain Protagonist or Anti-Villain who is interested in redemption, either because they've kept their standards, or because they've been in conflict with an even worse villain and shown hints that there might be some good left in them after all. Whatever the case may be, the character is in a bad place but wants to do better, and they are granted one final chance to do so, usually in the form of a grand, nearly impossible task.
Maybe they're being asked to prevent The End of the World as We Know It, or to cure The Virus, or to stop the Evil Overlord. They may not be expected to live through this, but if they can pull it off, no one can say that they haven't cleared their name, regained their honor, or insured an afterlife in good old Fluffy Cloud Heaven. (That said, you may wind up with a case of Redemption Earns Life instead.)
Sometimes done in a quieter way as Character Development in a non-fantasy setting, where a character is looking to undo a past mistake or wrong to a love one that has haunted them or caused misery for people around them. Also known to happen in Sports Movies, where a character may see one last great year or performance as a redemption of their prior deeds or careers.
A Sub-Trope of The Hero's Journey and Must Make Amends. Usually follows a Heel Realization, Nice Job Breaking It, Hero! or someone saying What the Hell, Hero?. Naturally, a staple of The Atoner. An alternative to Redemption Equals Death. Often a result of Go and Sin No More. Contrast Redemption Failure. Related to Jerk-to-Nice-Guy Plot."
t18456,RedHerring,"A clue that leads in the wrong direction.
A red herring is a good red herring when it interweaves itself into the story's events. For example, the murder victim may have been a philanderer. His wife has no alibi. Aha! It was the wife!
The wife's lack of an alibi is a red herring. It turns out the wife was shtupping somebody else at the time and didn't want to provide that information. However, the deceased husband's philandering is what got him killed, as it turns out, by his girlfriend's jealous husband. Philandering as a motive is introduced for good cause, not just to set up suspicions about the wife's lack of an alibi.

This trope is often coupled with Never the Obvious Suspect, where the obvious suspect is used as a red herring, and the real culprit turns out to be someone unexpected.

t18466,RedRightHand,"There are heroes and then there are villains. And the audience needs to know which is which, even before anyone gets to Kick the Dog or Pet the Dog or does anything involving the metaphorical dog. The hero, in order to be properly heroic, will be handsome, possibly to a sickening degree. The villain may be good-looking as well, but if they are, they will often have some type of physical defect or tip-off to their monstrous nature.
People sympathize less with others who have a physical defect. This is in essence a deliberate trip to the Uncanny Valley, using the minor defect to provoke a negative audience response.
It's often a Mark of the Supernatural, resulting in a Glamour Failure that can be used to spot a creature's true nature even if it's a Voluntary Shapeshifter. Monstrous examples take the form of a Mark of the Beast, often including Fangs Are Evil, Femme Fatalons, and/or Horns of Villainy.
However, sometimes the trope is deconstructed to show that the character didn't start out evil but became evil because of being bullied or mocked for the deformity in question.
The phrase originally comes from Horace, a reference to Jupiter's wrath, Milton's translation of the term ""rubente dextra"" in Horace's Ode i.2,2-3. The famous work Paradise Lost, written by English Renaissance icon John Milton, re-popularized the phrase for modern English-speaking audiences.
The quote in Paradise Lost (Book II, 170-174) is: ""What if the breath that kindled those grim fires, / Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage, / And plunge us in the flames; or from above / Should intermitted vengeance arm again / His red right hand to plague us?"".
Related to Good Scars, Evil Scars, Scary Shiny Glasses, and Hypnotic Eyes. Since Evil Is Cool, a Red Right Hand may occasionally overlap with Fashionable Asymmetry. If the deformity also comes with labored breathing or a cough, it's Vader Breath. If this appearance carries discolored veins, it's Tainted Veins. A White-Haired Pretty Boy, the undeathly pale and an Evil Albino will typically fall under this category. Contrast The Grotesque, whose outer deformity hides inner goodness, although Grotesques may occasionally be given a Red Right Hand, usually symbolic of their struggle against inner evil or madness. Often results when someone Came Back Wrong. Contrast with Hidden Evil.
Not to be confused with the symbol of Ulster, A Date with Rosie Palms or the red left hand (and arm) given to C-3PO in The Force Awakens. For the more blatant examples, see Obviously Evil."
t18574,ReligiousAndMythologicalThemeNaming,"Naming characters after mythological and religious figures to make some significant connection between the two.
There's nothing particularly odd about women named Diana, Phoebe, or Cynthia. However, if you see a trio with those names, pay attention - all three names come from Greek mythology, so if you see a group like this, there's probably some Theme Naming going on (and as all those names can be applied to the same goddess, you might be in for some real fun). Likewise, a group of men named Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all gathered together indicates that they will probably end up doing something important (especially if they have a friend named Jesse or Joshua). If the names fail to make good on their symbolic connotation, it's Squat's in a Name.
Most cases of themed names from religion and mythology aren't so subtle, and will throw around names like Ra, Horus, and Sakhmet with reckless abandon. In some cases, there will be separate groups with their own themes, so you might end up with one group named after Celtic gods and another named after Native American spirits.

t18589,ReluctantWarrior,"A lot of heroes fight for peace, love, friendship, justice and all that sort of stuff. Occasionally they believe in violence as a last resort and as Dirty Business, following the path of the Martial Pacifist and falling back on their prodigious martial training only as the very last resort while avoiding unnecessary deaths. The Reluctant Warrior isn't quite so blessed, he lacks the Improbable Aiming Skills that could make his dealing with them bloodlessly possible. What's more, he will find himself constantly facing enemies who mean to hurt or kill him and his friends, and who are savvy enough to not hold a Villain Ball and dispose of themselves.
Nonetheless, they stand by their Actual Pacifist ideology and continually try to give peace a chance, even when doing so verges on being a Horrible Judge of Character when offered to irredeemably evil opponents. Sadly, they will still rack up a body count. Even so, they won't give up trying to hold to their Heroic Vow, even if it's functionally a Frequently-Broken Unbreakable Vow. They keep trying since they know that pure pacifism will cause more problems than solve, even if it means having to fight and kill again.
Because of these conflicting impulses, straight heroes who are Reluctant Warriors will spend a lot of time agonizing over their choices and circumstances, but somehow manage to keep the Angst under control (well, until the villain tries to Break Them by Talking about their similarities). An Anti-Hero or Anti-Villain who is a Reluctant Warrior (it can happen) likely has some underlying good goal and means well — for loose definitions of ""well"" — and nonetheless laments but will not hesitate to use force.
Contrast Suicidal Pacifism. Compare Heroic Neutral and Slave Mooks. Contrast Blood Knight, who is this trope's exact opposite."
t18665,RequisiteRoyalRegalia,"Despite what some would like to believe, there is no inherent majesty in royalty that radiates off them, save for certain Speculative Fiction stories. This is why they use special accessories to make their station clear to everyone looking at them. Since this is done in Real Life, why should fiction be any different?
As for fiction, The Law of Conservation of Detail means one of these can't show up unless it has something to do with royalty, however tenuous. The wearer could be actual royalty, or it could be a contest where the winner is given a crown and/or cape, hence being given a sort of recognition as royalty. (Or, of course, in a culture where the monarch selects the heir, it can be both.)
Of course in fiction, the Ermine Cape Effect is often applied, so royalty tends to wear one or more of these constantly, unless they are Modest Royalty.
In European royalty, the most common ways to identify royalty are:

Nobles can also make use of regalia when they are working directly for the king, or when there is no monarch, to indicate the chief of a council of nobles. They wear special stripy mantles of their own, dependent on rank, and even have a coronet (a small crown with no arches) for very special occasions. Other times there is a Dress Code dictating what regalia the royals and the nobles wear.
Also, in some fiction, these tend to have magical properties related to royalty. Even if not, these will rarely be as heavy, delicate, or cumbersome in fiction as they are in real life, unless it's explicitly mentioned as a Take That! to royal life.
A Super-Trope to Ermine Cape Effect (in that the regalia is worn no matter the situation).
Compare Everything's Better with Princesses, Impractically Fancy Outfit, Gold Makes Everything Shiny (which a lot of regalia uses).
This item is available in the Trope Co. catalog.
N.B. If a character simply wears one of these, it's probably best to just list that in Ermine Cape Effect. This works better if reserved for instances that we can state how they actually stand out in some way."
t18678,RescueRomance,"One of the methods writers use to jumpstart relationships. A variety of Samaritan Relationship Starter.
Alice is in a fix. She has tried everything. She doesn't know what to do. When all hope seems lost, Bob comes in at the last minute and rescues Alice, causing Alice to fall in love with him.
If done humorously, this is done at the beginning of a series, adding to the Harem. A staged rescue is a common simple plan to get a couple together.
Done seriously, this is one of the ways writers get a relationship hampered by Cannot Spit It Out started, as opposed to communication, or heck; they might not have even met or talked to each other previously.
A typical set up goes something like this (adjust the details to fit your setting): An agile male character, often the Hero, meeting a female character (Love Interests, etc) by saving them from being hit on by thugs, or older (college) men who seem lecherous. The thugs grab the female by the hand and pull her away to have a ""cup of tea"" with them, or become violent as she stubbornly rejects their advances (may involve knives). Enter the hero, either hitting the offenders in the arm, or entering the scene by kicking the guy (head, solar plexus, etc), and saving her from forceful romantic advances. (And possibly incurring some injuries, enabling the After-Action Patch-Up.)
Oddly enough some medieval romancers, despite being the reason Damsel in Distress is called that (""damsel"" being the diminutive of medieval French for ""lady""), actually sometimes didn't like this trope. Basically some of them thought that, since the girl now owed the guy, the resulting romance wasn't pure enough, aesthetically speaking. The various aristocrats who paid their bills mostly told 'em to shut up; part of the ideal of knighthood was being a protector, and who doesn't want to hear about a good deed they could actually do being rewarded with some sweet lovin'?
Expect a negative response from some if this chickifies an Action Girl (though this can be almost completely negated by having the couple take turns with the Distress Ball). Nevertheless, the Knight in Shining Armor saving the Damsel in Distress who he then weds and the two living Happily Ever After is at least Older Than Feudalism, going back at least as far as the myth of Perseus and Andromeda.
It is a subset of Meet Cute and thus a common subject of fanfic in regards to Shipping. If Rescue Romance is a manly man's reward for being a valiant protector, the Florence Nightingale Effect is a womanly woman's reward for being a caring nurturer.

t18954,RoaringRampageOfRevenge,"She's making her list, she's checking it twice, and she's checking off your name after she's killed you nice, probably for making it personal. And in the above example she's even quoting her own movie poster blurb. But it's okay—you deserve it—because you're evil, you kidnapped her child, and you probably kicked her dog (if not worse) as well. Either you're a minion or you're the Big Bad behind it all, but it doesn't matter in the end because either way, you're going down… and Alice or Bob is going to be the one to do it, even if it means going down with you.
The Roaring Rampage of Revenge differs from the standard Revenge plot in that our hero dispenses with the Machiavellian plotting that would define a classic revenge tale and goes straight for the bloodshed, either in a single, violent Unstoppable Rage or Tranquil Fury-fueled rampage on the bad guy's home base, or a more methodical ""working one's way up the food chain"" from lesser foes to the bigger fish.
If the hero has a specific hit-list, this usually ends up as a Gotta Kill Them All situation as the hero hunts down and kills each bad guy on the list before moving on to the next. In most cases, the second to last bad guy on the hit-list is the Dragon for whichever Big Bad that the hero has saved for last, and is usually someone the hero has an especially personal beef with and/or is the most psychotic or otherwise hateworthy foe on the list aside from the Big Bad. If the hero decided a rampage wasn't enough, the hero may resort to an Extreme Mêlée Revenge to let the bad guys feel the pain with a hard punch in the guts.
Alternately the reasoning is that the hero just has a single lead, and each lead gives him/her one more name or clue before they die.
Of course; sometimes the Hero's target is not so specific as one person. Sometimes it can branch out to an entire organization, or to an entire race or species. Some examples of this could be a partisan whose family was killed by soldiers on a Rape, Pillage, and Burn raid (and who in retaliation is killing as many soldiers from that army as possible), or an apocalypse survivor whose son was killed by zombies (and who as a result devotes his life to ridding the world of them).
Many such avengers may keep a Tragic Keepsake to remind them of their lost loved one or other reason that they're on this vendetta to begin with, although they may fall victim to Forgotten Fallen Friend if the quest goes on long enough. Sometimes fulfilling the revenge may end up as a case of Vengeance Feels Empty and not give the avenger the expected joy, particularly if they come to feel that the avenged would not have wanted it that way. While in some cases, fulfilling the revenge may instead end up with the avenger becoming bloodthirsty and developing a Blood Knight personality, or worse, Put the ""Laughter"" in ""Slaughter"".
Would-be avengers need to be extremely careful about falling into He Who Fights Monsters territory. It's one thing to take revenge on someone who is directly responsible for wronging you, but it's quite another to extend your revenge to that person's children, people who are only tangentially related to the main target, and any innocent bystanders unlucky enough to get in the way. If this happens, then The Hero may cease to be worthy of that title.
Compare Last Stand, where the motives are frequently the same. May be a case of Revenge Before Reason culminating in a Self-Destructive Charge. In other cases, the anger has burned itself out by the end, leaving only a dogged Determinator to finish the task. Also compare to Roaring Rampage of Rescue, where the goal of the rampage is to rescue a loved one rather to exact revenge for what was done to them. The two may overlap, particularly if the rescuers fail to save their loved ones and settle for avenging them."
t19114,RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething,"Due to Everything's Better with Princesses, and other such tropes, there is a belief that being royalty means doing almost nothing else but, well, being royalty. Aside from all the pomp, ceremony, galas, balls, intrigue, and the occasional dealing with actual governing of the country, royalty just doesn't do anything else with their time. This has some Truth in Television, such as the court at Versailles or the Forbidden City in China, but not uniformly so.
Just as often as not, royalty would actually do something worthwhile with their time. For centuries from prehistoric Mesopotamia through to the Middle Ages, kings were expected to be strong warriors, defend their holdings, and inspire the people around them. In fact, ""strong man who can lead the other men of the village in fighting off enemies"" was probably the original meaning of kingship. Three examples are Alexander the Great, Charlemagne, and Genghis Khan, kings who gained and kept their power through their skill as generals and warriors and, in the case of the latter two, administrators. note Sadly, there are many royals who conspired against their people in their free time. This in turn gave them greater power, so an incentive to carry that out, as well. Many of the nouveau riche, for instance, were generals and warriors who started wearing crowns and intermarrying, while taking out their competition.
This convention also led to the establishment of the feudal system. It was actually a deal between the king, nobles, and serfs. The serfs would work on the land owned by their lords, and the lords would train to be warriors (aka, knights), who would defend the kingdom against invaders, like the Vikings. note It was only after the protection part was dropped by the lords that serfdom became no different from slavery. And we know how well that turned out.
Either way, being royalty does not necessarily mean a life of leisure or boredom. And fiction occasionally nods to this.
Note that this trope means that the person is still acting as royalty, just doing other things. So a Rebellious Princess does not count, since she is running away from that kind of life. King Incognito may count, if the king is attempting to learn things to influence how he reigns; to do it for fun, even if it proves educational, does not count.
It should also be noted that much of the ""activities"" done by royalty (charity events, sport, arts, etc.) are enabled by their being part of the idle rich, instead of having to work for a living. Also, especially in the case of charity events and good causes, this is often a calculated public relations maneuver, which is not to say that it makes the activities any less of a good impact, there are simply multiple reasons for said activities.
The French have a phrase for this: noblesse oblige (lit. ""nobility obligates""). It means that the nobility should fulfill the responsibilities of their position.

t19186,RunningGag,"A joke whose humor derives from repetition, ideally becoming funnier each time it is repeated. Must be repeated at least three times, otherwise it's a Brick Joke or Chekhov's Gag. But repeat it too many times and it can become an Overly Long Gag. A variant is a joke that occurs Once an Episode; doing that too often threatens to turn it into an Overused Running Gag.
The ultimate fear for the use of any running gag is that it becomes an Overly Long Gag, or worse, it was never funny in the first place and didn't improve through repetition. Nothing is worse than starting a one hour show with a joke that bombs that you're going to use twenty times over the next hour.
A Running Gag can be limited to a particular episode or recur throughout an entire series. If it recurs throughout an entire series, then it will often develop variations and/or be accompanied by Lampshade Hanging. If a character breaks the fourth wall to mention it, it's Didn't We Use This Joke Already?. When the story goes on to kill off the gag for good (either with a final payoff or just by referencing that it's become too overused and it's ending right then), that is Running Gagged.
A comedy Catchphrase is a type of Running Gag. Can become potential for Memetic Mutation if the gag itself is widely applicable. Compare Arc Words, which are a recurring phrase that isn't a gag. See subtropes Once per Episode and Every Episode Ending."
t19267,SalvagePirates,"Our heroes are adrift and need of rescue. Maybe they are in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean. Maybe they are in an escape pod or a damaged starship floating in the vastness of space. Maybe their airplane or spaceship crashed in a desert, or a jungle, or on an uncharted island or planet. They need rescue.
And rescue arrives! Or so it seems. Actually, the first people to show up are more interested in stealing their stuff and looting their bodies than they are in actually rescuing anyone. Survivors just jeopardize the salvage value of whatever bits of Phlebotinum are left over. Our heroes either have to fight them, or escape from them, or turn the tables and steal their ship instead.
Very much a part of many Robinsonade plots. Probably the reason is that the ""surviving with ingenuity on a desert island"" part of the story eventually gets boring, and to have a dramatic climax before the final rescuing there is nothing better than to throw in a fight with Pirates for no other reason than the Rule of Cool.
See also Space Pirates and Bedouin Rescue Service."
t19300,SanitySlippage,"A character has been a bit ... off for a while now. Maybe they just haven't been themselves, maybe they've gone as far as painting a Room Full of Crazy while reciting a Madness Mantra, or maybe they've gone through a Madness Makeover, but it's apparent from their actions that their rational mind is losing its grip and they are sliding inch by inch toward insanity.
The end result of this varies, depending on the tone of the series and who the character is. If the series is dark and edgy, they may go on a murderous rampage. On the other hand, if it's light and soft, it may just be Played for Laughs, becoming a source for their hilarious dialogue and wacky plans. A villain is likely to have a Villainous Breakdown resulting in Karmic Death, while a hero will just have a Heroic BSoD and then get better.
Occasionally, a character will be seen holding back their insanity and generally keeping it in check, until that final straw breaks the camel's back and they finally snap, having a massive Freak Out!.
And most rarely, the Sanity Slippage is the effect of being Gaslighted by a villain.
A common way to demonstrate this process is Mundane Horror: when some weird and unsettling details appear in everyday life, this may be the first sign that a character is losing his grasp on reality.
A Super-Trope to Sanity Slippage Song.

t19414,ScarsAreForever,"In Fiction Land, it's easier to come Back from the Dead than it is to get rid of a scar or recover a lost limb.
While it's true that Beauty Is Never Tarnished, and it's a Good Thing You Can Heal means it's highly unlikely for serious injury to happen or leave scars in the first place, there are occasions when a character can't count on that to save them, and they get badly injured in the line of duty. These injuries can be scars, lost limbs, or losing an eye... and the wounds you would expect to see in Real Life aren't reset or retconned away.
Akin to a Traumatic Haircut, but more grisly and more permanent, the injuries serve as a constant reminder of their sacrifice or failure.
A few series have ingenious ways of keeping the character spry after these injuries. Scars always look cool regardless, and Artificial Limbs are awesome, then there's Disability Superpower, or just plain taking a level in badass because Eyepatches are cool!
A few magical series may have the Healing Hands to completely cure or regenerate these wounds, but an author set on hurting their characters can find ways to avoid removing them. A few choose to keep them, or discover the wound is cursed, or is too old to heal. Losing the scar can be just as momentous as well; there are wounds that ""only love can heal"" and will only be healed once an epiphany is reached.
To the Pain usually does not get carried out — but when it does, count on its leaving scars. Similar to Healing Hands, Psychic Surgery never leaves scars.
Truth in Television as when a person is injured, the wounded skin attempts to pull itself back together using collagen (a protein that binds the skin cells together), but for the more severe cases (deep cuts, third-degree burns, etc), the body goes in emergency mode and tends to leave an effective, but very messy and haphazardly done structure - that is the scar. Most if not all scars really are permanent, though - some are just more visible than others.
See also Death by Origin Story, Every Scar Has a Story, Scar Survey, A Scar to Remember.
Often Achey Scars. Sometimes, too, an indication that the character will suffer Death by Disfigurement, especially if female or Bishounen."
t19445,SceneryPorn,"Scenery porn is the emphasis on luscious backgrounds with great detail, lovely lighting or both. It means that the makers put in extra effort for something that might not have direct influence on the plot. Of course, there are extra points to be earned when the scenery actually enhances the plot in some sort of symbolic fashion.
In live-action movies, scenery porn is in effect when extra effort is put into emphasizing a beautiful surrounding, usually wide-open landscapes. Stage productions can have copious amounts of this trope with elaborate sets and backdrops. A main characteristic is that the scenery is almost treated as a character in its own right, either as a passive onlooker or with a more active role, depending on the setting of the show (if the scenery is literally a character with a mind of its own, then it's a Genius Loci). Awesome Music makes it all the better..
In literature, scenery porn manifests itself as long paragraphs that go into more detail about the setting than necessary, such as describing at length the mountains of the Swiss countryside, or name-dropping all the streets in Chicago as the character turns on them. It's the author's way of proving that he's from the area in question or did the research, and while it's a great bonus for people who know the area, it can be seen as Filler to just about everyone else. On the extreme end of this, some works are popular entirely because they are nothing but Scenery Porn.
Often used to show that The World Is Just Awesome. Compare Shoot the Money. This can be distracting in video games when part of an Empty Room Psych, though with the advent of higher and higher-powered consoles and computers, ever-increasing levels of scenery detail are now possible. Silent Scenery Panel has a high chance being this. When the landscape evokes horror or despair rather than wonder, it's Scenery Gorn. Also compare Costume Porn, Gun Porn, and its Super-Trope, Awesome Art. Not to be confused with when someone ""knows"" the scenery.
Compare Real Place Background."
t19574,ScrewThisImOuttaHere,"Henchman Bob is beginning to have second thoughts about his career with the Evil Overlord. Maybe he's dissatisfied with the lack of advancement opportunities, what with the Big Bad's tendency to kill subordinates for ""motivational"" reasons, personal utilitaristic reasons, or no reason. Maybe he's smart enough to realize that the next visit from the good guys won't end well for Team Evil. Or maybe Bob's just sick and tired of kicking puppies for a living.
Whatever the reason, Henchman Bob's had it up to here with Team Evil, so he washes his hands of the conflict and walks away.
Allies of the Good Guys can pull this as well, but they're much more likely to return and save the day in the nick of time. If not, then they'll be branded a Dirty Coward or a Dangerous Deserter. Granted, this happens to deserters from Team Evil in a lot of cases, but since the audience will probably side with the good guys anyway...
When this is done by children — or by childish adults — it's considered more contemptible than truly evil, and mockingly referred to as ""taking your ball and going home"" (in reference to the deserter taking the ball so the game couldn't continue without him).
If a character (especially a minor one) is going to drop a Precision F-Strike, this is one of the most likely places. When the character does this specifically as an act of betrayal (i.e., wanting whoever is with them to suffer) and not just them saving their own hides, it's Betrayal by Inaction. Related to Know When to Fold 'Em, though this trope might be seen as less honorable. Refusal of the Call occurs when the consequences of doing this are especially dire. When players of a video game do this, it often doubles as a Rage Quit.
Not to be confused with Line in the Sand, where a general gives his troops the opportunity to leave before a suicidal battle. Nor Opt Out, in which someone quits for reasons of principle rather than mere frustration or cowardice. This trope is only for characters who cut and run without their superiors' knowledge, permission, or both. Also not to be confused with Heel–Face Turn or Mook–Face Turn, where someone on the bad guys' side decides not just to walk away, but actively to join the forces of good. If they resort to a violent solo career (or in company with other deserters), they're a Dangerous Deserter.
Inverse of Attack! Attack! Attack!, but the former followed by this trope can result in Attack! Attack... Retreat! Retreat!. Compare and contrast Tactical Withdrawal for more organized, strategic decisions, and Run or Die and Don't Ask, Just Run for when everyone agrees that running away screaming is the appropriate response. Contrast Resignations Not Accepted where one tries to flee, but can't."
t19693,SecretTestOfCharacter,"The character is undertaking a challenge of courage, strength or skill for some important prize. However, at a critical moment, The Hero is confronted with doing something that is morally unacceptable. Despite being warned about a forfeit if the reprehensible act is not done, the hero reluctantly stands by the decision and accepts that the challenge is lost, expecting no credit for the deed, often not expecting anyone to know.
Alternately, the hero may be faced with a task outside of the challenge that is noble, but doing that task will force him to lose the prize—an innocent stranger to save during a heated race, for instance, or helping a competitor who had become injured rather than just running to the end himself. The hero says ""Screw the Rules, I'm Doing What's Right!"" and goes to help.
However, the hero is then told that that forfeiting the challenge in this way is exactly what was needed to triumph. It was actually a test of character, and the hero has passed with flying colors.
The hero seldom rejects the tester, the reward, or the whole situation on the grounds that it was an underhanded trick — and this is not only when the other character was a Mentor, Threshold Guardian, or otherwise an authority figure, but between equals (such as a Fidelity Test.) More often, the hero is profoundly relieved and/or pleased that his apparent sacrifice to his conscience has been rewarded after fearing they have lost everything.
Watch for Exact Words. When a character is told that the prize depends on the ""results"" or ""outcome"" rather than the success, it will be phrased in such a manner that no one would, at first glance, take it to mean anything but success, but the character saying it can point out that he is doing exactly what he said. (If more than one character tried, and one succeeded in the ostensible goal but still failed the test, expect bitterness.)
Sometimes, instead of refusing or doing the act, the hero will Take a Third Option.
This will sometimes occur in the context of a Training ""Accident"" or The Game Never Stopped. A reversal of Threshold Guardians. A Career-Building Blunder operates on a similar principle.
A Sub-Trope of Sweet and Sour Grapes and Secret Test. Contrast If You're So Evil, Eat This Kitten, which is this trope applied to villainous behavior. Angel Unaware, A Chat with Satan, Honest Axe, ""Leave Your Quest"" Test, Nice to the Waiter, and Unwinnable Training Simulation are related types of tests. What You Are in the Dark is related as well: Most Secret Tests involve putting you in the dark to test you.
Old Beggar Test is a Sub-Trope involving a powerful figure disguised in rags testing the hero's moral capacities. If it's not a test of moral character, it's just a Secret Test or a Hidden Purpose Test."
t19853,SequelHook,"A Sequel Hook is something in a work that suggests that there is a clear possibility for another story. The MacGuffins may come in threes, the Big Bad might be Not Quite Dead, or, more blatantly, as the story ends another adventure might be shown beginning.
The original work still has closure but, by leaving minor plot elements unresolved, the writer has made writing a sequel easier. If the audience demand is there, they'll be ready. In fact, this method is so common the audience will identify any unresolved plot element or any ending short of Happily Ever After or Kill ’Em All as a hook. Sometimes the hook was just that, the writers are not sure which direction they would be going in the later movie.
Pretty much every film based on a comic book sets itself up for a sequel, and any movie that goes out of its way to establish a very expansive universe that has room for a sequel. In the case of adaptations their source is usually a medium known for making multiple storylines and, in most cases, have a decades-long Myth Arc to mine for ideas.
If the Sequel Hook revolves about a character other than the main character, it may indicate a possibility of Changing of the Guard.
Make note that a Sequel Hook is not a combination of a Mythology Gag you noticed and wishful thinking. This is where the movie takes a brief side glance to let you know that more is coming. This is recognizable to almost anyone watching/reading, not just the fans that notice a minor gag in an adaptation.
If the story is complex enough, there can be a fine line between this and an outright Cliffhanger. And the two can overlap if the story concludes, everyone's happy and then a new problem shows up to put everyone in turmoil.
If a movie poses a Sequel Hook only for no sequel to ultimately be forthcoming, this can be the source of unintentional humour later on down the track.
Considering that most stories need a conflict because of the Rule of Drama, this trope may often result in Happy Ending Override, Status Quo Is God or All for Nothing if the sequel is made.
Compare The End... Or Is It?, Here We Go Again!, The Stinger, And the Adventure Continues, To Be Continued, Saved for the Sequel, Sequel Snark and ""Will Return"" Caption. Can occur as part of Inescapable Horror. Obviously, many spoilers ahead."
t20110,ShipperOnDeck,"A character in a story actively ships two other characters in the story, trying to make them realize their true feelings while they're both still claiming that She Is Not My Girlfriend.
This character could be someone in love with one of the characters in the pairing who wants their beloved to be happy, or they could be a very good friend, or maybe they're just someone who likes playing matchmaker. If everyone in the cast is shipping the same pairing it becomes a case of Everyone Can See It. May overlap with Love Informant.
Contrasting with The Matchmaker, the Shipper on Deck is usually a secondary character and the characters shipped are the protagonists of the story, and likely to be the Official Couple. Also contrast with Relationship Sabotage, where someone is trying to undermine a relationship that already exists (although the two can be part of the same plot quite easily, if the idea is to get someone out of one relationship and into another). Also contrasts with Shipping Torpedo, in which a character is against a pairing but may or may not go so far as to act on it, or Matchmaker Crush, when a character starts out trying to help one character hook up with another, but ends up falling in love with the person they were helping.
If the shipper has reasons beyond thinking they're a cute couple, they're a Shipper with an Agenda.
Beware a Creator's Pet if this is the writer trying to reinforce a disliked pairing."
t20214,ShoutOut,"A Shout-Out is something (a name, line of dialogue, or prop) in a show that refers to fans or family members of the cast or crew, or to another source of inspiration. By nature, these can be obscure for casual fans.
The idea isn't new even if this term is. Arthur Conley, in his 1967 hit ""Sweet Soul Music"" mentions several performers by name he finds have done great work, by ""spotlight"" on some of their songs of note or their distinctive style.
You can even talk about them in English class if only you call them ""allusions"". However, remember that many tropes, symbols, and such are older than they look and can, often, arise in parallel. So despite (or because of) the ubiquitous nature of some creative properties, that doesn't mean that anything that seems somewhat similar is referencing said work.
Reference Overdosed is when a series is loaded with these. Referenced by... is for the work that the Shout-Out is aimed at.
Giving references to other works can predate to older times but became increasingly common in medieval times. In modern times, almost every larger film, Video Game and so on intentionally references some other work, making the phenomenon nearly omnipresent.
Tropes Are Tools applies to Shout-Outs. A good Shout-Out should still fit within the context of the story or it may end up a Big-Lipped Alligator Moment to people not familiar with what's being shouted about. It also has to be subtle enough that viewers either only notice the double meaning after a trip to the fridge or have a short chuckle if they notice it immediately, a blatant Shout-Out will break the Suspension of Disbelief and kick viewers out of the story. (Especially if it's Breaking the Fourth Wall. Shout-Outs that the characters would recognize get a little more leeway.) An explicit, open Shout-Out to one of the work's sources of inspiration is an Inspiration Nod.
Remember that a Shout-Out must be deliberate on the part of the authors; simply resembling something from another work is not sufficient, and the very existence of tropes and popular culture means that it's natural for resemblances to appear without any intent on the part of the authors. Just because two characters use similar unusual weapons or wear similarly-shaped sunglasses doesn't mean one is a reference to the other; just because two plots are similar doesn't mean there's actually any connection between them. Small Reference Pools can also lead people to see Shout-Outs where none exist because their own favorite things loom large in their mind. A true Shout-Out is intended to be noticed, so if there's any doubt, it's probably just a coincidence.
As a general rule of thumb, if the example is be couched with Word Cruft like, ""seems to be,"" ""bears a resemblance to"" or ""could possibly be,"" it's almost certainly not an example.
See also Homage, Expy, Stock Shout-Outs, Opening Shout-Out, Shout-Out Theme Naming and The Joy of X. Literary Allusion Title is a subtrope. Easily confused with a Mythology Gag and Continuity Nod, and may overlap with Actor Allusion. Contrast Take That!, which is a negatively-spirited Shout-Out. Biblical Shout-Outs should go on As the Good Book Says....
See Stock Shout-Outs for a list of Shout-Outs and other references common enough to earn their own page.
Remember, a Shout-Out is intentional. If a character just happened to use a similar turn of phrase to another work, that's just a coincidence."
t20226,ShownTheirWork,"Although many talents in fictional media show they didn't do their research, some actually did. In fact, sometimes they learned so much and worked so hard to learn it that it would hardly seem fitting to just not show it off. They may also very well have Cast the Expert.
The Shown Their Work trope comes in when the creators tweak their stories to show the viewer/reader what they have learned. The trick is to do it so this advances the story instead of stopping it cold. When it's done right in a well-made work, awards for its educational value can be just as nifty as the artistic awards.
This often happens in older, harder Sci-Fi books, wherein the authors try to keep the science as consistent as possible with currently-understood scientific theories. Of course, since Science Marches On, this may date the book badly.
More often than not, the stuff authors look into won't be things with which the average Joe is familiar. If it's something particularly unrealistic, the audience might just write it off as typical fiction, even though it actually is a thing.
When an author claims to have done the research but definitely hasn't, that's Dan Browned. Any examples of that list are there; here, the claim is proven correct.
Note that this does not include explicitly educational productions, since they obviously have to be both accurate and explanatory to be effective.
Compare Doing It for the Art, Narrative Filigree (both also about going above and beyond in regards to production quality), Lampshaded the Obscure Reference, and any Artistic License.
Note that this is only as good as the writer makes it. Just because you did the research, doesn't mean it adds to the story, especially if the research is shoehorned in just to show off. Likewise, sometimes it's better just to make things up. Remember that one of the reasons why the Sci Fi Ghetto existed in the first place was because authors of old (and some even now) overused this trope, creating walls of Info Dump instead of stories. If people wanted to have a lecture in science, they would grab scientific essays in the first place.
Also keep in mind that referencing things doesn't by default make a work smarter than one that doesn't.
Try to keep this page from becoming Gushing About Shows You Like.
There's a LiveJournal community for authors conducting such research on non-trivial topics.
If the work is simply using real locations as backgrounds, consider using Real Place Background. If the work contains both real backgrounds and other research, then by all means include it here as well.
Compare Truth in Television, if the certain element shown in the work is ubiquitous. Contrast Critical Research Failure and Dan Browned."
t20265,SiblingYinYang,"In real life, siblings rarely act the same. Fiction sometimes takes this to an extreme.
Enter Sibling Yin-Yang, the occurrence of siblings that are polar opposites. If he's cool and reckless, she's responsible and thoughtful. If she's a spiky-haired hooligan, he's the nerdy wimpy one. If he's an immature brat, she's... well, you get the picture.
The even more extreme form leads to Polar Opposite Twins or even Evil Twin. When this leads to complete antagonism, it becomes Cain and Abel. See also The Glorious War of Sisterly Rivalry and Tomboy and Girly Girl. If an Aesop is involved, chances are it's a case of Foolish Sibling, Responsible Sibling."
t20374,SimpleYetOpulent,"When anything costs a lot of money, but doesn't bling itself out. It could be something that looks plain, but was made with high-quality materials and workmanship; on the other hand, it could be something that is clearly expensive (or at least clear to people at the time) but doesn't overload itself with bells and whistles (so to speak). So it's still Conspicuous Consumption, but not ""in your face"" conspicuous.
Take a Bentley or Rolls-Royce. The look of those cars clearly shows that they are luxury cars, but they (usually) aren't tricked out enough to count as a Pimped-Out Car (but would certainly count as a Cool Car).
Or take many evening dresses from at least The '30s onward (or dresses of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, during the post-French Revolution mania for ""Greek-style"" and ""Roman-style"" clothing). Many are free of the frills and trimmings that were typical of evening dresses, so they wouldn't qualify as a Pimped-Out Dress. However, they're made from high quality fabric, so they would still cost a lot.
Men's fashion often falls into this. The difference between a bespoke suit and an off-the-rack one that costs a fifth to a tenth as much is mainly this: the bespoke suit probably has better fabric (hard to tell without touching it), and it fits really, really well. If you don't know what to look for, you don't know there's anything luxurious about the suit itself—the man wearing it just looks really good.
This also applies to high-quality minimalist architecture and design.
In fiction, this is done for three reasons:
This can easily overlap with The Rich Have White Stuff, when a thing has few trimmings or decorations, but being white still marks it as opulent.
A Sister Trope to Modest Royalty, Mundane Luxury, Little Black Dress, Sharp-Dressed Man (as such a nice suit wouldn't be cheap), High Class Gloves (they don't have to be flashy to mark the wearer as affluent), Ominous Opera Cape (as the cape used to be a sign of a high class gentleman).
Compare Simple, yet Awesome, More Than Meets the Eye, Worthless Yellow Rocks (something is only opulent to some cultures).
Contrast Impoverished Patrician (who can't afford even these things), All That Glitters (which looks grand but isn't), and Ermine Cape Effect (opulent and obvious, to show one's power).
Compare / Contrast Costume Porn."
t20706,SmugSnake,"The Smug Snake is a type of character (usually a villain) who tends to treat friends and enemies alike with equal disdain. They almost constantly speak in a sarcastic tone and punctuate most of their sentences with a smirk. While they aspire to be a formidable and awe-inspiring adversary, they often end up just being a Big Bad Wannabe, failing in the face of more cunning villains or ending up as their servants, in which case they'll generally be The Starscream. Others that fall under this trope are simply in it to bug the good guys and take advantage of their moral insecurity.
A key character trait common to Smug Snakes is overconfidence. The Smug Snake is usually too arrogant to be rattled. Most often, they will think themselves to be the Magnificent Bastard. While they may believe that they have the situation under control (whether they do so through blackmail, coercion, or simply being in a position of authority), there will usually be a hole in that plan that they failed to consider. Perhaps they underestimated their opponents' abilities and claimed themselves unbeatable, or maybe they made a really stupid mistake along the way. Once that realization hits, expect the Snake to lose their cool right before everything starts falling apart for them. They are not necessarily entirely incompetent, stupid, or ineffectual, however, and may succeed with at least part of their goals, but they are still lacking that charm and grace that the Magnificent Bastard possesses, and even the clever ones all too often end up being Too Clever by Half. Often a Know-Nothing Know-It-All as well, to inspire added bile, though still enough to take the 'sympathetic' out of Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain (the best of them are Insufferable Geniuses heavy on the former and light on the latter). If a Smug Snake considers himself a Magnificent Bastard, then he is a villainous Small Name, Big Ego. When things go badly, the Smug Snake may reveal himself to be a Dirty Coward and pathetically grovel when a former victim asks Who's Laughing Now? or beg the victim to save them in the event of outside danger.
Most of the time, a writer will purposely introduce a Smug Snake as a target for audience hate by making them Kick the Dog or bend the rules to get their way and come out smelling like a rose. Basically, this is a villain that's made to be hated and the audience will enjoy hating. This, like all other tropes, can backfire if misused. If the writer still tries to foist the character as a Magnificent Bastard when their previous actions have proven otherwise, the audience will likely stop enjoying hating the character, and instead genuinely hate them as much as they would The Scrappy or the Creator's Pet. Evolving a Smug Snake into a true Magnificent Bastard could be doable, in theory, but shouldn't be attempted lightly, and has only been pulled off successfully in fiction a few times. Ever. Of course, the author might be deliberately doing this, playing a villain up as a Magnificent Bastard when it comes to getting the power he craves, but proving to be so inept at wielding that power once he finally has it that he ends up as a Smug Snake instead. The line between those two tropes is thinner than it looks after all and the further a character overestimates himself and underestimates the others the closer he leans to Smug Snake territory even if he is normally a Magnificent Bastard. So it is a state of mind directly proportional to the overconfidence and a character who has a good reason to have a high idea of himself will need to exaggerate his self-worth more to reach it than someone who hasn't.
The Smug Snake will rarely be a Draco in Leather Pants, because, as previously stated, he tends to be created intentionally to be loathed by the audience. (However, it is possible for this to happen, especially if the character is physically attractive — the Trope Namer himself is an example.)
Contrast Worthy Opponent and Magnificent Bastard, who inspire respect and/or admiration from their opponents/the audience, and Awesome Ego, whose brash cockiness is part of his or her charm (although any of these may be perceived as a Smug Snake by an audience via Alternative Character Interpretation or simply poor writing). Compare and contrast Smug Super, for when the person's arrogance and ego can actually be backed up with feats. Not to be confused with the player characters of Metal Gear, the criminal from The Simpsons, or the principal of Degrassi.
Subtrope of the Sin of Pride.
This trope has sometimes Truth in Television, but let's leave it here, so no Real Life examples, please."
t20743,SnowballFight,"THIS MEANS WAR!
Fortunately, with this weather, we have plenty of weapons. Just pack the snow into snowballs.
Common in stories featuring children, where it usually ends up being Serious Business. Also may feature as a lighter moment in military stories. Can be used as a winter-themed version of Dodgeball Is Hell.
Putting ice — or rocks — in snowballs, however, can convert it to actually serious (if not deadly) business.
Frequent in Let There Be Snow and Snowed-In.
Truth in Television, and a staple of snow days."
t20764,SoBeautifulItsACurse,"A very specific form of Blessed with Suck that comes up regularly where a character's beauty is a source of problems. This is usually because of its effect on other characters, often times inspiring jealousy, intimidation, suspicion, or unwanted attention. Otherwise, the character is only noticed because of their looks and not their personal merits. In cases where a character complains about their beauty expect their complaints to be dismissed or add more resentment from other characters.
In historical settings, her family will try to exploit her beauty for their social advantage. This may be a Rags to Royalty Arranged Marriage — or a less formal form.
Rape as Drama is the most vivid form of illustrating this ""curse"". This trope is also a Cyclical Trope in that a given audience may or may not take it seriously depending on current events and the time period. If the character in question is pushed far enough, they might end up Tarnishing Their Own Beauty. May take the form of Only Has Same-Sex Admirers, particularly in Pretty Boy and Bifauxnen characters.
Many Mary Sue writers will often use this trope as a ""flaw"", but what needs to be understood is that it is not a flaw in and of itself, but a situation that can lead to a character developing flaws as a result. When someone's beauty is all that many people see, the character may well grow distrustful and cynical of others, fear being stalked or taken advantage of, or harbor harmful and emotionally damaging beliefs about themselves and others, such as a belief that their only worth is in their looks, that looks are all people value in them, and/or that they will never be respected for their own personal merits or achievements not related to beauty.

It's generally not a good idea to pair this trope up with Screw the Rules, I'm Beautiful! unless you want your character to develop a nice frothy Hatedom."
t21291,StalkerWithACrush,"A character noted for their obsession with another character. They claim that the motivation for their morally outrageous acts is a simple wish to gain attention from the crush-ee. Alternatively, the obsession may be explained as a misguided desire to ""protect"" note (which often translates to isolate or smother) the crush-ee, whether or not the crush-ee wants or needs such ""protection"". In any case, the more sincere they seem, the creepier they are.
Why does this happen? Because Love Makes You Evil, and ""If I Can't Have You..., No One Will!""
There'll usually be a Double Standard at play with this trope. Male stalkers are more likely to be portrayed unsympathetically, and as an actual danger to their object of obsession. Female stalkers, by contrast, are likely to be portrayed sympathetically, and typically portrayed as charming or cute (though beware the Woman Scorned!).note This is partly due to male stalkers being more likely to murder their victims than female stalkers, and partly due to the assumption that males aren't as picky when it comes to love or sex in the first place.
Compare Stalker Without a Crush, whose obsession is unrelated to romantic feelings."
t21293,StalkerWithoutACrush,"Not all stalkers are motivated by sexual or romantic desire. Some are non-romantically obsessed with someone, some want a favor from someone, some want to kill someone or otherwise do them ugly, some just want to stalk someone for the hell of it, or whatever other motives. A Mysterious Protector might be one of these.
Compare and contrast Stalker with a Crush. Contrast because it refers to motives other than having a crush on someone, and compare because it can often resemble that motive for stalking through the ""Does This Remind You of Anything?"" approach. Also, sometimes a Stalker Without A Crush can develop a crush on whomever they are stalking over time.
They appear very often in horror movies with a slasher killer. Chances are that the killer stalks and harasses someone who doesn't know them that well because the killer is an Ax-Crazy lunatic who wants to kill them. Said serial killer would follow them around forever until they have the perfect opportunity open.
Compare Mysterious Watcher."
t21339,StarCrossedLovers,"Two lovers—often but not always teenagers—doomed to be kept apart no matter how hard they struggle to be together. It may be Fate, or fatally-Feuding Families, or it may be something as mundane as a few hundred miles' separation, but something will always be in their way. Often, the two can only be Together in Death. William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is the most famous example (and the Trope Namer), but the archetype dates at least as far back as Mesopotamian Mythology and Egyptian Mythology, making it Older Than Dirt.
In modern times, the term ""star-crossed"" is often unknowingly misused to mean lovers who are meant to be together. It means just the opposite—the stars (i.e. destiny or the heavens) have ruled against them, or ""crossed"" their plan. Compare the word ""disaster"", which has the etymology ""away; without"" (""dis"") + ""star; planet"" (""aster""). Then again, if the stars rule that much, they probably decreed the love as well as the impossibility, making the stars capricious and cruel at the very least. It also refers to destiny and the inevitability of the two characters' paths crossing each other. It usually, but not always, refers to unlucky outcomes, since Romeo and Juliet's affair ended tragically. Further, it may also connote that the lovers entered into their union without sufficient forethought or preparation, that they did not have adequate knowledge of each other, or that they were not thinking rationally (because they were being controlled by fate).
One common version of this trope, Love Above One's Station (i.e., being in love with someone from a different social class), is at least discredited if not actually dead and buried in contemporary settings, but was very much true in the past, and can still work when applied to historical settings. While it's difficult even today to have a relationship with someone from a very different background, in the old days, it was all but impossible: if you were from the lower class and courted your ""better"", you'd be treated with the vilest contempt and risk arrest and/or violence (possibly even death); meanwhile, a ""better"" who reciprocated would be disowned and possibly shut off in a nunnery, a monastery—or even an asylum.
Hence all those tragic ""servant/slave/peasant loves the lord/lady/king/queen, and their Love Ruins the Realm"" stories. The accepted practice for someone in love with a royal, at least in contemporary fiction, was to express that love through loyalty and duty rather than presume to have a romantic relationship with them.
Forbidden Love and its sub-tropes are often the reason two lovers are star-crossed. May be used as a Pretext for War. One of the top reasons for a Balcony Wooing Scene.
Contrast Love Transcends Spacetime and Nobody Thinks It Will Work, where the power of love overcomes."
t21384,StaticCharacter,"Change isn't always a good thing, nor necessary. Likewise some characters, be they round or flat, will end a story with pretty much the same personality and traits they began with. These Static Characters can go entire seasons or books without changing or experiencing the Character Development that a more Dynamic Character does. If they ever learn a lesson that might make them change noticeably, they will always immediately forget all about it by the next episode. Learned nothing and forgotten nothing, if you will.
This is NOT necessarily a bad thing, as some characters don't need Character Development. A badass does not have to decay into The Woobie to stay an interesting character —- while some consumers may embrace the evolution, others will cry out, ""We Want Our Jerk Back!"" Such characters are useful in secondary roles, serving as yardsticks against which your central (and Dynamic) character's growth can be a foil. If you want your Static Character in the central role, just enforce it internally, using a Pygmalion Snapback or a painful collision with Status Quo Is God. Some comedies are built around characters whose personalities are set in stone and will never change, whatever happens. For that matter, every tragedy is built around characters whose personalities are set in stone and will not change, whatever happens.
Also note that Static Characters are not by definition boring. Obviously, it helps if you've got a Round Character, as exploring all their pre-existing facets can entertain without requiring character evolution. Furthermore, the introduction of Hidden Depths or an exploration of a Dark and Troubled Past accomplishes similar things; while the character is technically not evolving, the audience's perception of the character very much does. And these characters are ripe for internal conflict, since we already know a fair bit about them. Interest can also be wrung out of exploring how and why the character stays so constant in the face of the dramatic events of the plot — this can in itself be evidence of unusual self-assurance, determination or unflappability.
Having said that, Flat Characters who are also Static may begin to get dull unless the author takes care to make them entertaining somehow, be they the Butt-Monkey or perpetual Fish out of Water.
Despite their unchanging nature, Early Installment Weirdness can still a distinct possibility; Static Characters are frequently the result of Flanderization.
Static Characters are not to be confused with the Character Static."
t21429,StealthPun,"The writers put in a joke (almost always a pun), but never make or put in a Punch Line or explicit statement, hiding it in the set up of the joke. Some percentage of the audience will ""get"" the joke, but the rest will know it was there and be going, ""What? Why didn't you say it?"" There can be several reasons.
The form can range a bit from a ""fill in the blank"" stand-up-style jokes to cases where the plot and setting form a pun that you only realise when you try to summarise the situation later. If you're on the Internet, expect someone to respond with, ""I see what you did there"".
Also, as this page is about puns that are intentionally obscured in-work, it is one of the few times when it is good form to explain the joke. Use your judgment to avoid far-reaching examples; almost anything can be turned into a pun with enough thought. We want the ones that were likely intended by the creators.
Compare Visual Pun, another form of subtle punning and Subverted Punchline, for when the audience thinks they know what's coming. See Don't Explain the Joke for the complete opposite. Sister Trope of Orphaned Setup."
t21533,StockUnsolvedMysteries,"The possibility to let your characters witness or even participate in events that actually happened, is probably one of the most appealing aspects of Historical Fiction, Flashbacks, Time Travel stories and the like. But sometimes it can be quite hard to shoehorn your characters in, if you don't want to sacrifice too much of historical accuracy. Especially if your character doesn't quite fit into the historical setting, because he is a Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot.
The solution: Take a famous historical event that is shrouded in mystery, an event of which not many details are publicly known. Then fill the gap of historical records with whatever you want, this way ""revealing"" what actually happened. This adds the bonus that everyone likes a good mystery (and its eventual solution).
Depending on the tone and genre of your work, your ""explanation"" can range from mundane, over humorous, to absolutely fantastic.
The Been There, Shaped History person likes to cause these events. Of course Historical Domain Characters as well as fictional Public Domain Characters may be involved too. Perhaps they did even use a Public Domain Artifact.
Anyway, in the end you can proudly claim that your story is Very Loosely Based on a True Story.
Closely related to Historical In-Joke. Can also overlap with Beethoven Was an Alien Spy, when the focus lies on specific historical individuals. Often happens at, and tightly involves, a Landmark of Lore through Alternate Landmark History. Also, at least one of this events is a must-have for any Conspiracy Kitchen Sink story worth its salt.
Note that sometimes mysteries get solved, or even debunked as not having been that mysterious in the first place. In this case the work either was written in a time before the solution/debunking, or the writer didn't get the memo, or he's just using Artistic License. For obvious reasons, solutions that are perceived as ""boring"" are the most likely to be disregarded by writers.

t21776,SuckOutThePoison,"Alice and Bob trek through a desert. Bob unwittingly steps on a snake - and, unfortunately for him, it's venomous. Immediately, Alice starts sucking out the poison to buy him some time before they find real aid...
Do Not Try This at Home. This used to be taught up until recently-ish, but as it turns out, A) All the bacteria in your mouth could cause an infection in the wounded person; B) Sucking out of a thin puncture will only make the area swell, and C) You're too late - the moment a person's heart beats after a bite, the venom is already circulating around their body anyway.
Note that this trope, like most snake-bite ""cures"", became popular because it seems to work. This is helped by the fact that people survive the vast majority of venomous snake bites even without treatment, and a large proportion of snakebites are 'dry', meaning the snake releases no venom anyway. So, someone gets bitten, someone else 'sucks out the venom' (even though there is no venom), and the person gets better (simply because most people do), and both parties become convinced that sucking out the venom works!
In reality, the currently advised First Aid for snakebites is to keep the victim calm, prevent them from moving, and arrange for them to be transported to the hospital. In Australia, a country packed with things that can and will bite or sting you on a moment's notice, pressure immobilisation bandages are also recommended.
May be used as a form of Intimate Healing. Similar to Kiss of Life, as both require pressing one's lips to an injured party's body, but since any part of the body can be poisoned, it's as likely to be gross or funny as sexy. A subtrope of Worst Aid."
t21795,SuddenlyShouting,"Two characters are carrying on a conversation. Alice says something. Bob responds in his regular voice, but then SUDDENLY HE'S SHOUTING!
Typically happens for one of three reasons:
Compare Careful with That Axe and Last Note Nightmare, which apply a similar sort of logic to music. Sometimes overlaps with Punctuated! For! Emphasis! or HA HA HA— No. Not to be confused with Suddenly Susan the song ""Suddenly Seymour""."
t22096,SweetPollyOliver,"A female character dresses up as a man to accomplish some end. Often becomes a variant of the Jackie Robinson Story. The sports version is especially popular in children's media, since it allows for an Anviliciously contemptuous boys' team for the heroine to win over with her talents.
Named for the old, old folk song ""Sweet Polly Oliver"" (quoted above), in which a woman disguises herself as a man so she can join the army and follow her soldier lover. However, the trope predates the name, going back apparently to a 6th century AD Chinese myth. And of course, women disguising themselves as men in order to join the military has happened time and again throughout history, for any number of reasons—a deeply held desire to do so, a living in times when there was no other way to support herself, even getting away from a terrible situation at home.
A transgender man might be mistaken for a Sweet Polly Oliver. It can be difficult or impossible to tell if a Real Life Sweet Polly Oliver was actually trans.
If a girl dresses like that all the time, she might be a Wholesome Crossdresser. Sometimes the audience (or a character) doesn't know this at first, and is surprised to find out Samus Is a Girl.
Contrast with Harmless Lady Disguise, Moustache de Plume, and Disguised in Drag; is a type of She Is the King (Type 1, to be specific). Some men may subconsciously see through this, and become Sweet on Polly Oliver. Since, in most cultures, she needs a new name, may occasion a Meaningful Rename. Not to be confused with Bifauxnen. If employing this trope allows a female character to be the first of her gender to achieve something, she's Breaking the Glass Ceiling (or sneaking past it, anyway).
Many times when this is done in film and TV, the actress playing the crossdressing character rarely does a convincing job (see Hollywood Homely), requiring Suspension of Disbelief on the part of the audience that the other characters encountering her really believe she is male. On the other hand, quite a few women really did get away with this surprisingly easily in the past, which The Folklore of Discworld phrases as:
To make it easier for the audience to believe that Sweet Polly Oliver passes for male, she'll often be tall and lack curves. If she begins crossdressing at a young age, she might worry about it being harder to pass when she goes through puberty.
As a type of Weirdness Censor, the human mind will simply ignore small details that could give the ruse away, once it has classified a person as either male or female. And in societies in which male and female gender roles are clearly separated with no room for overlaps, this effect would be even stronger, as the idea of meeting a crossdresser would be even more inconceivable than it is today.
You can listen to the full version of the song here."
t22111,SwissArmyWeapon,"When you have your weapon act like it is a Swiss-Army Knife — having multiple functions in one — you have a Swiss-Army Weapon.
There are many ways of accomplishing this. The most common is having your weapon be several weapons in one, whether they are weapons literally strapped onto each other and capable of acting as 2 (or more) weapons at the same time, or having several forms it can cycle through. Or, it may just be a humble single-formed weapon that the user finds many uses for, including uses that are improbable and sometimes non-combat utility that may be mundane in nature.
The advantages are numerous; it gives you more versatility in combat, letting you handle more problems than someone with only one weapon. It also (usually) takes less space than if you carry several weapons at once, making you less encumbered. Be careful of Rummage Fail, however, which is a bit of a problem in the middle of battle. So what else can a character do if they want the versatility of, oh, say... ten pointy and blasty things?
See also Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot.
See Magic Tool and Every Device Is a Swiss-Army Knife for the tool-oriented variant of this trope (though weapons that combine the uses of/have tools and weapons in them aren't unheard of). Related is Bifurcated Weapon, a weapon that can be separated into smaller weapons; the fact that the ""separated form"" and ""combined form"" add to the user's versatility makes it much like this trope. Sub-Trope of Impossibly Cool Weapon. Supertrope to:
The self-directed version is a Do-Anything Robot. And of course, this weapon goes very well with Adaptive Armor.
Do not confuse with actual Swiss-Army Weapons."
t22113,SwissCheeseSecurity,"Characters can enter the premises of a certain facility whenever the plot necessitates it, despite presumably locked doors or obvious obstacles. Any trouble they should logically run into seems to be deliberately not shown. Sometimes this is just a matter of not having enough money for a transitional set.
Expect The Guards Must Be Crazy trope for some of these places. If the character has already broken in when the owner returns, it overlaps with Trespassing to Talk.
See also Bavarian Fire Drill, Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy, No OSHA Compliance, Unguided Lab Tour, and What's Up, King Dude?. Compare Unsafe Haven and Cardboard Prison.
If the facility in question actually does have good security but is easily breached anyways, it may be a case of Dungeon Bypass."
t22115,SwitchingPOV,"A switching Point of View is closely related to, but distinct from, Rotating Protagonist. Rather than an omniscient third-person narrator showing us Jack, then Sally, then Pauline, as we would with a Rotating Protagonist, we see the story from Jack's perspective, then Sally's, then Pauline's. Can be very useful if the POV is third-person limited or first-person, as this can give us information we otherwise wouldn't have — for instance, we could find out that Pauline's motivations are genuinely good or she really did kill that guy, something neither Jack nor Sally would know.
The most obvious way to do this is to switch from Jack being ""I"" to Sally being ""I,"" as even if they're both in the scene, it's clear whom the focus is on. A book can also pull this off with third-person limited (you see both as ""s/he"", but you're only inside one's head at a time). Primarily a literature trope, but a duet or film can also work. You just need narration of some sort.
Switching from first person (I) to second (you) or third (s/he) would also work. Obviously, this is quite useful if one character falls unconscious or ill, or is simply not where the author needs the story to be.
Sister Trope to ""Rashomon""-Style, but the accounts do not need to disagree or even overlap, and also Rotating Protagonist, but rather than simply seeing different characters, we get their perspectives. Super-Trope to Scrapbook Story. See also Twisted Echo Cut. When all main characters get their POV represented except one, it's a Non-P.O.V. Protagonist. Not to be confused with Camera Perspective Switch, where the camera's point of view changes, or Perspective Reversal, where characters change their beliefs so that each expresses ideas formerly associated with the other."
t22219,TakeThat,"Every so often a TV Series, Film, or even radio talk show will make a reference to another one, usually in the same market niche or genre. Most of the time it's just a simple Shout-Out or a Homage, and if it's a Comedy Series, you can expect at least a little spoofing.
But sometimes it's a bit more mean-spirited than that. Whether it's because of a perceived rivalry, jealousy, bitterness, or pride, the mention will be derogatory and boastful. More often than not, rather than being a ""Take that!"" to the disparaged show, it'll reflect even worse on the joker, making a good production turn sour, and a bad production look like a monumental act of hubris. It can be especially jarring (and often hilarious for reasons the producers didn't intend) if the show being mocked goes on to win popular and/or critical acclaim, awards, and respect from its audience, while the show doing the mocking becomes widely reviled or forgotten. And even when that doesn't happen, a particularly nasty and/or unsubtle Take That can alienate fans of whatever it's targeting rather than making them laugh. On the flip side, however, a ""Take That"" which is well-done and on-point can be enjoyable and satisfying to watch (even if mainly in a schadenfreude sense), and if the creator is particularly skilled, then even the target might be willing to admit that the Take That had a point, or at least was Actually Pretty Funny.
""Take That"" is something you hear a lot on DVD commentaries. Whenever the show gets to a gag that's at the expense of some real-life group(s), the commentator says, ""Take that, celebrity / studio / organization / other target!""
It is more likely to occur if the creators of the work are relatively confident they won't suffer any significant backlash from the insult; for example, someone who has Protection from Editors, or the writer of a Fan Work or Webcomic.
Often, a Take That will be aimed at someone or something related to the work itself:
This is sometimes known as a ""potshot"" in normal parlance.
A common element of commercials. Often uses Brand X / No Celebrities Were Harmed / Scapegoat Ads.
Not to be confused with This Loser Is You, nor with the British boy band. Nor the Big Word Shout used by protagonists in the Ace Attorney series, nor the Board Game mechanic where players directly make moves against others in the game. Often a Super-Trope of Muse Abuse.
Note to Tropers: Please do not pothole any ""hilarious"" insults you may feel like making towards your least favorite work to this article. We tried letting that slide once, but the potshots got too frequent for their own good and had to be quashed (that, and it's Conversation in the Main Page nine times out of ten)."
t22250,TalkingAnimal,"Many cartoons have them — some animation companies have made their entire core casts out of them. Very simply, these are animals who talk. They are a lot better at it than the Speech-Impaired Animal. They can easily hold down a conversation with human members of the cast. It's not like every human Speaks Fluent Animal either; the animals themselves are able to talk and that's just the way it is.
Despite their ability to speak, they are still animals in almost every other way, particularly when it comes to instincts, priorities and motivations. They very rarely wear clothes, and they are often vocally proud of the fact they aren't human. They may even choose to talk to no one but a single human, who typically finds this very disturbing. They may even break the Fourth Wall and talk only to the viewer.
There is some Truth in Television — a few animals have a naturally humanlike voice, believe it or not. note Goats in general are considered elderly due to their old-sounding voice. Blue-fronted Amazons in general are considered very young due to their childlike voice. Rams in general. Hoover the talking seal, a zebra.
A Talking Animal doesn't have human mannerisms, making them different from:
A good comparison: Ralph the mouse (from The Mouse and the Motorcycle) is a Civilized Animal; he lives in a mousehole, dodges cats, and runs around naked (save for his fur), yet he enjoys motorcycles and regularly talks to the human boy Keith. Mickey Mouse is an example of Funny Animal; he lives in a house, drives a car, wears clothing, and sprays his garden with pesticides (think about that for a second).
Like many Speech Impaired Animals and Nearly Normal Animals, many Talking Animals lack hands and walk on all fours, negating the possibility of performing many human tasks and behaviors. A few examples are bipedal if their species is flexible enough. However, when required by a joke, the Talking Animal can sometimes act like the more anthropomorphic Civilized Animal or Funny Animal.
Since these are otherwise normal animals who are able to talk, the issues of Furry Confusion don't usually come up. The issue of What Measure Is A Nonhuman, however, is far more likely to affect a Talking Animal than a Funny Animal. That said, Talking Animals are likely to voice just what they think about humans...
The Fairy Tale is more likely to feature a talking animal than a fairy. (Although they do often turn out to be humans under a curse. Or even ghosts.)
Lots of verbal jokes involve talking animals, with the humour usually deriving from a trait of that animal or a pun based on the word for the animal. A common subversion of these jokes is to replace the punchline with something along the lines of ""Holy crap, a talking horse!"" See also Not in Front of the Parrot.
Fun fact: As ridiculous as it sounds, there are some books like Charlotte's Web that were banned in some areas of the U.S. because they had talking animals in them.
Many Weasel Mascots, Non Human Sidekicks, and Team Pets are Talking Animals. Talking birds are a separate subtrope. Compare Intellectual Animal, Sapient Steed, and Uplifted Animal. For the next step ""up"" in the latter, see Partially Civilized Animal, Civilized Animal, and Mouse World. See also Sliding Scale of Anthropomorphism.
Compare Animal Talk. Contrast Pantomime Animal."
t22582,TheAlcoholic,"WHERE'S MY BOURBON?
This person likes their liquor, and in large amounts. They may realize they have a problem, and get on and Off the Wagon, or they may be a Drunken Master, and this is merely a part of their ""training"", or a result of their — ""skills"".
Sometimes, this character is merely Drowning Their Sorrows and will bounce back later in the series. Other times, they've been this way from the beginning and has no plans to stop anytime soon. Worried friends may try to help by Nailing Them to the Wagon, though this attempt at forcing them to go Cold Turkey will result in delirium tremens (hence why it is a tradition in psychology that when rehabilitating someone, do it step-by-step).
Real Life alcoholics are not always lying in the gutter — sometimes they are just people who drink alone, or for the sake of drinking, but never appearing to drink to excess (due to tolerance). Commonly, alcohol is drunk due to its effects as an anti-anxiety drug. It is entirely possible that successful people may be alcoholics on the inside. The High-Functioning Alcoholic is proof that sometimes you cannot tell an alcoholic by mere appearance, and they may be in fact be in lofty professions such as law and politics (both highly associated with alcoholism; there are even specialized help lines and recovery networks for lawyers and judges needing help with alcohol and drug use). Hollywood, however, prefers the ""Straw Boozer"" form: someone wandering the streets in a stupor with a bottle in their hand is more obvious and pathetic than a high-functioning alcoholic who usually stays in their room with a glass in hand contemplating.
Most fictional alcoholics experience Pink Elephants — another trope that only loosely touches on the reality.
There is no known cure for alcoholism. Someone who has managed to quit the habit is considered a recovering alcoholic, and if committed to it, remains in whatever therapy he or she used to become sober. That said, there are people who quit without therapy, or who stay sober without therapy, as well as some (very) rare people who don't become sober but do become moderate and responsible drinkers (and their mere existence is controversial to the point of Flame Wars over whether they are ""in denial"" or if it really is possible to drink responsibly once having become addicted).
Note that making a Real Life actual alcoholic (as in a physically addicted to alcohol one, not just an emotionally addicted one or ordinary irresponsible drinker) go cold turkey is putting their life at risk, as alcohol withdrawal can lead to delirium tremens, which, if untreated, results in death. Physically addicted alcoholics must be tapered off of alcohol, slowly reducing the amount they drink, or weaned from it in a proper hospital setting where if they begin to go into delirium tremens, it can be treated.
The Always Female versions are Hard-Drinking Party Girl and Lady Drunk, but alcoholism is only one of her character traits.
Compare The Stoner, Drunken Master, Vodka Drunkenski, Hard-Drinking Party Girl, Off the Wagon, Beergasm, Quick Nip, I'll Tell You When I've Had Enough!, and Addled Addict. If the whole plot is about how a character became an alcoholic, it's an example of Descent into Addiction. Oddly, there are ""alcoholics"" who can get drunk off of milk. The Teetotaler is the direct opposite.

t22620,TheAtoner,"Once, there was a major villain named Bob. He committed every crime one could think of, and he did it with a song in his heart and a skip in his step. Then, something happened to make him see the horror of what he was doing. He realized how much pain he had caused, and he set out on a personal quest to try to make it right.
The Atoner is an evil character who has realized the error of his ways, possibly wants to make amends, and has decided that they will do so via heroic deeds. Simple imprisonment won't do, because it does nothing to make recompense for what he's done wrong. Besides, he still has all these amazing skills and resources from the Bad Old Days — wouldn't it be better to use them for good?
The problem is, Bob often has to wrestle with the temptation to return to his old ways, along with the massive guilt built up over years of carefree evil. Also, said previous villain skills usually involve killing people in very messy ways, which can result in karmically harmful situations. Other times Bob's evil side won't go down without a fight, and manifests itself as an Enemy Within. Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that morality isn't a book that can be balanced—no amount of babies saved now will bring Bob's past victims back to life. The Atoner usually realizes that ""Redemption is the path, not the destination"" and continues for the rest of his life.
Sometimes 'the rest of his life' is short because Redemption Equals Death. Generally the only Atoners who avoid this are main characters who are already in the atoning stage by the series' start. Atoners often end up as Knights in Sour Armor. Those who believe redemption inherently equals death may well become Death Seekers.
A subtrope of this is ""Assassin Wants to Quit"". Stories involving them allow us to cheer on the assassin as they battle their former employers using the same murderous skills they honed during their previous career. Atoners sometimes go on a Redemption Quest in order to atone. If their deed of atonement is especially painful, it may overlap with The Penance.
Would-be Atoners who are not sincere are trying to Buy Them Off. Not to be confused with The Aloner, though they can both coincide if the character is trying to atone for killing off everyone else on the planet. And especially not to be confused with The Stoner (unless they turned to drugs to cope with their guilt). The Atoner may face rejection and hatred from those who don't believe he's reformed, which is Reformed, but Rejected, and more importantly, he must be careful not to run into the Heel–Face Door-Slam. In some instances, however, there are characters who will acknowledge The Atoner's change of heart, but do so in a grudging manner. The Atoner must also beware of one character who actively seeks to end his path to redemption.
The success rate of atoners depends on where the work sits on the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism. In more idealistic works, or at least ones that posit that people can change for the better, atoners may have a greater chance of success, as proof that no matter one's actions may have been in the past, it's always possible to change for the better and do good.
Genuine atoners have a high chance of becoming The Woobie, especially if they were an Anti-Villain in the first place. See also, Be All My Sins Remembered, where they continue to suffer a guilt complex over their past misdeeds. Contrast with My Greatest Failure — instead of a formerly evil character turning from their past, a good character feels the need to atone for not preventing a bad outcome (regardless of whether they could have changed anything), and Retired Monster — a villain who has retired from their villainy but hasn't shown any regret or remorse for their misdeeds nor has made any attempt to redeem themselves. The Atoner may have experienced Go and Sin No More."
t22655,TheBigGuy,"In any decent Team, someone's gotta be the powerhouse.
They are usually unflinchingly loyal, and often they are the largest member of The Team and more effective in combat than anyone else. (Sometimes combined.) They will often be the point man that holds off the mooks while the others challenge the Big Bad. While The Leader and The Lancer fight side-by-side, The Big Guy can be a One-Man Army. Against stronger enemies they might end up suffering The Worf Effect; getting trounced to set up the villain as a credible threat.
Usually what holds them back from leadership is being Dumb Muscle, they know how to knock heads together but don't do much in the way of strategy. Despite this, as renowned warriors, they may still exercise authority over the support troops.
Note: The Big Guy may not necessarily be the strongest in the team, (and usually isn't by the end.) They just have to be the one who, out of most duties, specializes in physical fighting.
Traits common to the Big Guy include:
Powers and skills common to the big guy are:
More women are filling this role, which used to be a rarity unless the whole team was composed of women. Since physical strength is usually a masculine trait, she may be a tomboy, Lad-ette, or mannish. But you can flip this on its head by making her the Amazon: big, and beautiful.
If she's playing the tough guy straight, her softer side is often a secret cache of girlish habits which she finds embarrassing. On rare occasions, she may be revealed to be a Butch Lesbian, a Tsundere, or even a Violently Protective Girlfriend.
When there are Two Girls to a Team, the Big Girl and The Chick commonly form a Tomboy and Girly Girl pair. Most of the time, the Big Girl is the tomboy and the Chick is the girly girl.
Not to be confused with The Strongman (though overlap is not unheard of) or that other Big Guy.
Can have some overlap with Scary Black Man, The Strongman and the Proud Warrior Race Guy especially when dealing with dwarves. Often a victim of Big Guy Fatality Syndrome."
t22699,TheCasanova,"The (legal, and less repulsive than the better-known types) sexual predator — a man who relentlessly pursues, lands, loves, and then abandons members of the opposite sex, a skill bestowed upon him to demonstrate what a badass he is. Sometimes comic, sometimes a monster, always successful, this character leaves behind a string of broken hearts, and occasional vows of revenge that are rarely fulfilled. Casanova's only motivation is indulging his lust and desire, sating them with the bodies of his conquests.
This trope tends to suffer from three double standards when portrayed in media;
Contrast with the unsuccessful Casanova Wannabe. Compare with the inexplicable Kavorka Man. A guy who gets the girls like a Casanova, but unintentionally, is a Chick Magnet. If kind-hearted, may overlap with Chivalrous Pervert. The Charmer is equally charming but less sex-obsessed. If they really get around but want to settle down, it's Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places. A Handsome Lech has more negative connotations and a sparser scorecard than the Casanova.
The trope is named for Giacomo Casanova (1725-1798), a soldier, spy, diplomat, adventurer, and librarian whose extensive but unreliable autobiography (in which he almost literally described himself as God's Gift to Womennote ""Feeling that I was born for the sex opposite of mine, I have always loved it and done all that I could to make myself loved by it."") established his eternal fame as a lover. It should be noted that the historical Casanova was closer to a Chivalrous Pervert who really was looking for love... just with women who were locked in loveless political marriages — and also gained his successes famously ugly. (Definitely◊ he was no Heath Ledger◊.) Interesting and prone to be noted for his modern wannabes, he was one of the few 18th century men who bathed almost daily and asked the same thing from his partners.
Many films, TV movies and TV mini-series are named for and based on that person. The best known are Fellini's 1976 film, the 2005 film starring Heath Ledger, and the 2005 BBC drama mini-series starring David Tennant. The latter is considered one of the more faithful adaptations of Casanova's memoirs, while Fellini's... wasn't.
For the juvenile version — all of the above without the sex — see Kid-anova. Contrast the Serial Romeo (who falls in love with a long succession of women, one at a time and for reasonable periods). If the guy is actually only rumored to be a Casanova and has no evidence onscreen, it's the Urban Legend Love Life. If he develops feelings for one of his conquests (or someone who refuses him), he's a Ladykiller in Love. See More Friends, More Benefits for when the mechanics of a game encourage the player character to act this way.
Note: It should be mentioned that even after the affairs were over, most of Casanova's ex-lovers still liked him, and he was reputedly quite the gentleman. This trope would probably fit (the fictional) Don Juan better.
Finally, a warning: Despite ManEater being a redirect, this trope should NOT be confused with I'm a Humanitarian. Seriously, some people actually made this error on here."
t22720,TheChessmaster,"The Chessmaster gets his/her name from his/her ability to manipulate events (that is, they cause events to develop in the way they want in order to produce a desired result through planning them out) as if they were pieces on a chessboard. Chessmasters tug at their strings of influence, patiently move their pieces into places that often seem harmless or pointless until the trap is closed, and get innocent Unwitting Pawns (who else?) to do all the heavy lifting. The best will also have layers upon layers of misdirection and backup plans in case some unexpected hero appears to gum up the works.
Chessmasters can sometimes be on the side of good, but if so they'll almost certainly be the Anti-Hero (the Pragmatic Hero variation) at best or the Well-Intentioned Extremist at worst, as it's very hard to plan a Chessmaster scheme that doesn't sacrifice a few pawns along the way. Heroic Chessmasters are very often introduced as a Mysterious Employer. The Svengali, in acting for the (supposed) good of his protégés, will often be this (and if he isn't, he'll pretend).
Chessmasters can occasionally be The Strategist, although given the volatility of war, most Strategists will only ply their schemes one campaign at a time, with an emphasis on short-term goals (and an eye towards all possible future contingencies). The Game Master may be a Chessmaster also, but many of them prefer to give their orders more directly. Many chessmasters are Villains With Good Publicity, but they can also be someone no one has ever heard of. Almost all Ancient Conspiracies are led by a collective of chessmasters, silently working toward their goals over generations. Chessmasters also tend to be overconfident and usually panic when their ""perfect"" plans fail—unless they just start laughing instead. This is also usually averted when Magnificent Bastard and Chessmaster overlap, since a Magnificent Bastard is quite good at rebounding from defeat. Fond of a Battle of Wits.
Of course, actual chess ability is implied, and some Chessmasters take it literally, mapping their plans out with an actual chessboard, occasionally with pieces shaped like the main characters. Don't ask how this works, or where they get pieces. This is most likely a result of Smart People Play Chess. Compare the Manipulative Bastard who tends to be more personal and controlling in her/his manipulations. Compare/contrast Opportunistic Bastard as well. Contrast Spanner in the Works, though it's possible for a character to be both of these.
Chessmasters are usually (but not always) non-physical and unsuitable for action due to age, infirm, or simply being a thinker, not a fighter.
If the chessmaster is the villain, when the hero defeats them it's usually via the one move they didn't plan for.
Not to be confused with The Chessmaster, a long-running series of chess videogames."
t22727,TheChosenOne,"Only you have been deemed worthy to describe the secrets of... The Chosen One.
Take it for granted that they are The Only One. These characters have been chosen by some force and they are now the only ones capable of resolving the plot. The methodology may be imprecise, and bonus points apply if ""chosen one"" is actually used in the work. The key here is that these characters are held in esteem for their expected potential, occasionally determined by past accomplishments.
That said, always be wary about what the character has been chosen for. If their job description involves ""defeating the darkness"" and involves long years of danger and struggle, chances are good that they've been made The Hero. If, on the other hand, their job description involves getting pampered by half-naked temple virgins, then chances are very good that they've been chosen to be a sacrifice instead! And woe betide the world should the Chosen One be chosen to be a villain instead of a hero...

Subtropes include:
Compare Giving the Sword to a Noob, where someone obtains a powerful weapon, but is not able to wield it properly. See also Stumbled Into the Plot, where the protagonist instead of being chosen is simply someone who found the Inciting Incident by chance."
t22820,TheDragon,"A person or monster The Hero has to get past to get at the Big Bad. Much of the time, but not necessarily, the Big Bad's top enforcer. He, she or it embodies a narrative trope: the penultimate challenge that the hero must face before confronting the Big Bad. This challenge will test their worthiness in some fundamental way.
Some Dragons are ferocious fighters who leave the heavy thinking to the boss. Others are smart, detail-oriented administrators who oversee the day-to-day running of the evil organization. A common but by no means universal theme is to have the Dragon pose a physical challenge to the hero, while the Big Bad poses a mental or moral challenge.
This role is somebody the Big Bad can rely on (or thinks they can rely on) in a time of trouble to step up and beat the living heck out of The Hero, or maybe just take charge for a while, should the Big Bad not be around to do the job.
The term dragon for this role originates from analysis of folklore in which the hero fights dragons or other monsters. As described in ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"", a non-fiction comparison of various fantasy heroes written by Joseph Campbell, monsters serve as obstacles to be overcome in order to fulfill the hero's quest. Note, however, that in folklore they are villains or obstacles in their own right (see the tale of Saint George The Dragonslayer) whereas in accordance with this trope (which mostly applies to modern media) they are often subordinate to other villains.
For literal dragons and their permutations, see Our Dragons Are Different. Not to be confused with Dragon Lady, who is more likely to be a Big Bad than the Dragon, or Dragon, which was a magazine. Definitely not to be confused with The Savage Dragon.
The Champion may be The Dragon if they follow the Big Bad, or may play a similar role to a straight Dragon for a nonvillainous character. See also: The Man Behind the Man, Hypercompetent Sidekick, Psycho for Hire, The Consigliere.
Tropes related to The Dragon:"
t22823,TheDreaded,"A villain or Anti-Hero whose primary characteristic is the fear the other side has of them.
To be the Dreaded, a character has to be far and away the most feared person in the story. These are people who make you quail not because of anything they are doing at that moment, but simply because you know who they are and what they're capable of... and sometimes the latter part is optional. Maybe this character has a reputation as a Hero Killer; a person who kills the other side's strongest and noblest supporters. Maybe they use fear as a magical effect which triggers panic in others. Maybe they've done so many horrible things that nobody ever wants to speak of them again. Maybe they are simply so mind-breakingly horrible even the strongest of hearts falter. But the defining trait of the Dreaded is that they are feared. Probably has a scary name, unless they use a really scary alias instead. If their ability in combat lives up to their reputation, then the only choice one has when facing them may be to Run or Die. When/if the Dreaded character dies, his/her/its death will almost certainly be followed by much rejoicing...if he's actually dead, that is (see the entry from Vlad the Impaler under the Real Life section).
Although there are exceptions, (particularly on the other side of the fence) a key characteristic of this trope tends to be invisibility. In general, characters—villains, in particular—who conform to this trope will not be seen directly the first few times they are mentioned. The show will tend to work on building up their perceived threat in the minds of the audience: a dark, shadowy something that's out there somewhere, but you don't know where, who or what they are, or even whether or not they can be killed, at least at first. As such, it usually involves acceptable forms of Character Shilling. It is possible for them to remain this trope after they come out of the shadows, but if they do not then beware Villain Decay.
Additionally there is a heroic equivalent called the Terror Hero, when there is a hero so renowned that the enemy would rather flee than possibly encounter them. They tend to be anti-heroes of some kind though (ranging from grades 2-4), due to audiences seldom associating dread as an emotion a pure hero inspires. Some criminals also tend to go for this in order to prevent anyone from informing on them.
Note that it isn't the audience's reaction to the Dreaded that matters, but the other characters' reactions to the Dreaded. Other characters think this person is pure Nightmare Fuel, whether they deserve this reputation or not.
See also Mook Horror Show; when The Hero is the dreaded to his enemies, this is a common way of demonstrating it. Not to be confused with characters who are merely dreaded, although both tropes may apply to the same character. Compare/contrast Respected by the Respected, where a character is defined by the respect other respected characters have for them. See Supernatural Fear Inducer for when a character can literally induce dread. See Hope Crusher where a character excels at snuffing out hope and/or spreading despair."
t22841,TheEmpire,"The Evil Counterpart to The Republic. The Foil to The Good Kingdom. The Shadow Archetype (or evil twin sister) to Hegemonic Empire. The Rival to The Federation. The Arch-Enemy of La Résistance. The Logical Extreme of the Rising Empire.
The Empire's defining Grand Ambition is World (Or Interstellar/Galactic/Universal) Domination. Amassing The Evil Army, it sets out to conquer all of its neighbours and be the sole superpower by force of arms. Taking cues from history, it often resembles the historic Roman, German, British, Russian/Soviet, or Chinese empires in some way. Led by The Emperor, who is usually also an Evil Overlord, Emperor Scientist, God-Emperor and/or some kind of theocratic cabal. A theocracy of a Religion of Evil will almost certainly be the Empire.
The Empire is typically Obviously Evil, but may still attempt to represent itself as the Lightbearer of Civilization, Defender of Faith, Domain of Law and Order, The Co-Prosperity Sphere, Central State of Humankind or Legitimate Regent of Humanity. A People's Republic of Tyranny may overlap with these titles. The Empire may be genuinely highly civilized, wealthy, organized, and/or vital, or corrupt, bureaucratic, sybarite and/or ossified. It may be militaristic and imperialistic, or pacifistic and turned inwards. In nearly all instances, the Empire features an original founding polity, usually a race or nationality, who stand above and enjoy special privileges that are denied to the Empire's various subject peoples. Overall will adhere to the trope Order Is Not Good.
Of course, there's going to be some kind of Resistance movement within its borders, and small autonomous nations without who may need encouragement by the heroes to become The Alliance. They may also be helped by Les Collaborateurs. There may also be one or more powers that oppose it, often good kingdoms or republics, which may or may not band together into The Alliance. The Empire is usually too strong to defeat militarily (unless the story is set in a war strategy video game), but taking down the leaders while they're instigating their sinister plan is usually enough. Or La Résistance may well turn out to be nothing but a treasonous clique to overthrow the government or dynasty and replace it with something even more cruel and brutal, or a nationalist or racist separation movement.
If the Empire and The Federation exist in the same universe, the two are usually at war, just recovering from a war, or dangerously close to getting into one (the latter two often coincide). If The Republic is a separate entity alongside The Federation, you'll usually find them taking shots at one another prior to forming a pact against the Empire; they could've been longstanding rivals, they might view the other as the Empire, or they might've been pinned against each other by the Empire. If The Good Kingdom is in the same universe, expect the Empire to occupy it (at best) or assault it (at worst); The Good Kingdom could've been neutral ground, the original head/proposer of The Alliance, or a simple victim of the Empire's bid for dominance. If the Empire is part of The Alliance, you can make a good bet for it being the Token Evil Teammate.
Note that just being called an Empire is not sufficient to qualify a nation for this trope. Especially in a Heroic Fantasy setting, other types of empires abound, often based on the Holy Roman Empire (and occasionally a more sympathetic take on the actual Roman, British, or Chinese Empires). These types of empires may be better described as an expansionist monarchy, a culturally dominant Hegemonic Empire, a militaristic federation, a nationalist republic, or a more centrally controlled alliance.
Weakened or weakening versions of the Empire often become Vestigial Empires. If the Empire has been overthrown or mostly overthrown but what's left of it is fighting to get back into power, it's The Remnant. One of its provinces may be a Voluntary Vassal, rather than a conquered one. The Empire tends to have its Standard Evil Empire Hierarchy.
For works named Empire, see this disambiguation page.
Suffice it to say that the Trope Namer is The Roman Empire. Other than that, No Real Life Examples, Please!. Most Real Life historical empires have fallen under the Hegemonic Empire class; infamously cruel empires tend not to last very long in the real world."
t22864,TheFairFolk,"Modern society has lived with the Disneyfied version of fairies for so long–the Fairy Godmothers of Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, Tinker Bell in Peter Pan–that it seems hard to imagine that some would consider fairies evil.
And yet, some of them were. The fairies of old weren't cute little bewinged pixies who fluttered happily around humans. Elves didn't make children toys or live deep in forests with no interaction with mortals. At best, they would interact with humans with either no thought to the consequences of their actions on the less-robust, time-and-consequences-dependent mortals (say, the Little People who put Rip Van Winkle to sleep: yay, not accidentally corpsifying him; boo, effectively stranding him in a foreign time period with no social ties)note that was the ghosts of Henry Hudson and his crew; however, traditionally, the line between fairies and ghosts has not been exactly sharp or as tricksters that delight in the utter mess they're making of mortal (and their own) lives (everything that Titania, Oberon, Puck and the rest get up to in A Midsummer Night's Dream). At worst, they're like The Joker with magic: otherworldly horrors who kidnap humans for explicit use as playthings to torment, assault, torture, maim or eat – or, sometimes, to find even worse, very abstract things to do them (some versions of ""Tam Lin"" get dark). The Fair Folk almost always live in the Land of Faerie, and may be depicted as an Inhumanly Beautiful Race. They are usually vulnerable to Cold Iron, though not always (Dullahan are weak to gold).

In a manner of speaking, the old version of fairies has been replaced with aliens. In both cases, you have creatures who are ineffable and don't understand humanity, who randomly abduct humans, play with them, and return them with Time Loss and occasionally strange powers/afflictions. Periodically, there are tales of those who have dealt with them and benefited, but for the most part, mundane people are merely their playthings. For more on this interpretation of this trope, see Alien Fair Folk.
Frequently found in concert with Grimmification, as the original folklore of the darker breeds of fairies needs little exaggeration. Compare and contrast Fairy Companion, Fairy Devilmother (a more lore-accurate equivalent of Fairy Godmother), Witch Species, Our Elves Are Better, Our Fairies Are Different, Our Goblins Are Different, Our Mermaids Are Different, Nature Spirit, and All Trolls Are Different. See also Changeling Tale, a specific subtrope having to do with fairy abduction, doppelgangers, and the like. Not to be confused with Changeling Fantasy, which is a type of Cinderella Situation.
All of the above aside, it's entirely possible for the fairies to be as diverse in their beliefs and actions as humans. Some fairies may be malevolent, but others may be friendly to humans, or at least willing to leave humans alone as long as the humans do the same. In some cases, the fairies may be more in conflict with each other than humans, and act accordingly.
The Wild Hunt is an often-overlapping trope from Celtic Mythology. Youkai are a rough Japanese equivalent. The Greys is a more modern trope with many similarities. Demons when not The Legions of Hell are often also portrayed this way. An extreme example may be a Humanoid Abomination."
t22878,TheFilmOfTheBook,"Got a hit book? Turn it into a hit film. What could be more natural? The name alone will sell tickets, the movie will bring the books back into the light for people wanting to read the original, and everybody either makes huge wads of cash or has a good time contributing to the economy. Simple, right?
Unfortunately, as many studios have found, it's not that simple. Print and film are very different media; what works for one will fall flat on the other. In print, special effects are cheap; in film, they are more expensive. In print, describing a character's thoughts is par for the course; in film, a voiceover is seldom acceptable. In print, a short story can take days to read; in film, audiences generally won't sit still for more than a few hours. In print, your award-winning author may have a way of spinning Black Comedy between dialogue; in film all their clever wordplay is fed to the dogs, making the film deadly serious. Getting round these problems means changing the story, for better or for worse.
One issue is that a typical novel is simply much too long to fit all of it in a two (or even three) hour movie, so significant parts of it must be hacked out. Sometimes entire characters may be changed, have their screen time lengthened/shortened (if not cut altogether), or important book-related plot points or dialogue may be whizzed by, creating a moment of Fridge Logic. All of this tends to a trendy belief that no matter how good or bad the movie is, ""The book was better.""
Sometimes though, the film is so successful the book gets forgotten over time. Other times, the original book is still read long after the film is forgotten. Most frequently though, the book will probably be republished with a cover based on the movie poster and ""Now a major motion picture!"" or something else emblazoned on it.
The Film of the Book is the opposite of Novelization, except when it's a new novelization of The Film of the Book.
The Other Wiki has something to say about this kind of thing in its usual style. Adaptations like this are likely to lead to Old Guard Versus New Blood incidents.
See also The Show of the Books, The Film of the Play, The Movie."
t22938,TheGoodChancellor,"As the Evil Chancellor is plotting to control the kingdom by usurping power, the Good Chancellor serves his kingdom or nation with utmost fervour. He follows the King's orders to the letter if the king is noble, and he tries to mitigate the suffering of his people if the king's intentions are of the bad kind. Rarely would he be seen actively opposing the King's actions, since as a Lawful Good person, he must not let ideas like rebellion or jealousy get in the way of running the kingdom in the king's name. This often does not sit well with some rebels, who see him as a moderate who must lose his head for being a supposed Yes-Man to the king they want on a pike. Unless of course the King cuts his head off first, in which case the rebels might see him as a martyr or a cautionary tale against using words against tyrants.
When meeting the heroes, he, not the king, is usually the true person who has information about the situation at hand. The king may know of the secrets, but the Chancellor knows the best answer for them.
In terms of the ranks of Authority Tropes, the tropes that are equal are The Caligula, Evil Chancellor, Standard Royal Court and Deadly Decadent Court. The next step down is The Brigadier. The next steps up are The Evil Prince, Prince Charming, Prince Charmless, Warrior Prince, The Wise Prince, and all Princess Tropes."
t22984,TheHero,"This person is a hero, pure and simple. They're almost always right, are a friend to all their teammates, and morally superior—without the usual flaws of Good Is Dumb or Well-Intentioned Extremist, unless it's a comedic work. They have a well-rounded skill set. They're not as strong as The Big Guy, or as intelligent as The Smart Guy, or as sensitive and socially adept as The Chick, but they're close. They can personally accomplish a variety of goals, but their real superpower is getting the whole diverse set of personalities to focus and pull together. They'll always know who to ask for help, and when—and usually how. Most often, they will be The Protagonist but there are exceptions to this rule. Just as often, they will be The Leader or otherwise the shining star that holds the Ragtag Bunch of Misfits together, but there are exceptions to this as well. In a team lineup, they will be front and center.
The concept of The Hero is very old and every culture and peoples have had individuals they identified as heroes. On account of Society Marches On and Values Dissonance, the notion of what the hero signifies has changed and diverged a great deal from the ancient world to the early modern world to the present day. Heroes in the ancient world were compelling because they embodied virtues and qualities common to the experience of people at the time (War, Violence, Survival) whereas later generations would seek idealized values from their heroes because of their desire and yearning for a better world.
In Team Trope dynamics and speculative fiction, you may notice powers and skills common to the hero, including:
The Hero is most often male and The Chick is usually in love with him. The primary romantic plot in the team is often between The Hero and The Chick, with The Lancer sometimes rounding out a triangle. The Hero might also be a Chaste Hero or a Celibate Hero as an additional complication to romantic subplots.
If the Hero has too many of the ""positive"" qualities listed above, they may degenerate into a Marty Stu. If they're too generic, then they're an Every Man (but please note that the Every Man does not have to be this trope or The Protagonist). They are sometimes the Only Sane Man trying to keep The Team together because they live in Dysfunction Junction. Because The Lancer is, by definition, The Hero's foil, The Hero and The Lancer usually have a special chemistry, either a Bash Brothers relationship or Red Oni, Blue Oni. They are often rivals with a strong mutual respect for each other, and are sometimes Heterosexual Life-Partners. They are likely to argue about who is The Leader, but as stated above, this role usually goes to the hero.
The Hero does not have to be The Leader. Indeed, since Villains Act, Heroes React, the hero often arrives on the scene a little too late, so his role and function in the story is more or less reactive and predetermined rather than ones that have been set or chosen by him which is counterintuitive to the role of The Leader. Indeed, The Hero is likely to get his marching orders from the Big Good. When heroes are leaders, expect them to be Frontline General or Badass in Charge. When they are merely part of a crew, expect them to start out as something of The Load if they're a Mouthy Kid or The Fool, but don't worry—in time, they will reveal their great potential, eventually swaying friend and foe alike to their cause. Even if they need significant growing up to reach that point. Eventually, The Leader they may very well become.
In cases where Heroes Act, Villains Hinder, a leader hero can take a more proactive role in the plot.
If there's a character cooler than the Hero, that character is generally Too Cool to Live. See also The Ace, The Kirk, Messianic Archetype, The Chosen One, and Hero Protagonist. A superhero is, by the catch-all definition, a hero (often with superpowers) who dedicates their very life to... well, being a hero.
Note: It is important to remember that while the hero is usually also The Protagonist, they are not necessarily one and the same. Whereas the hero is defined by the character traits described above, The Protagonist is defined by their central role in the story. In Star Wars, for instance, Luke Skywalker is an archetypical example of The Hero and is more or less the Main Character of the original trilogy, but the prequel trilogy establishes the more antiheroic Anakin Skywalker as The Protagonist of the film series as a whole, even though he is a villain for more than half of the saga. See Supporting Protagonist for instances in which this is the case.
Also Note: A character can be The Hero of the story without being part of a Five-Man Band. Also the generic namesake for Things I Will Do If I Am Ever the Hero."
t23063,TheLancer,"The Foil for a hero of the closely allied variety.
In general, the Lancer will often form one half of a Red Oni, Blue Oni contrasting duo with the main character. While they may butt heads with The Leader, they're usually the Best Friend by the end of it all.
Traits common to the Lancer include:
Due to most heroes being cheerful and passionate types, Lancers are often surly or analytical, but when the chips are down, Lancers are true as steel and will lay down their lives for the cause. If the rest of the members turn their backs on The Hero for some reason, the Lancer may be the only one who sticks by his side. In the event that The Leader of The Team is unable to lead, The Lancer usually steps up. This plot is used to contrast the leader's leadership style against what The Lancer's would be. A frequent ending for this plot is for The Lancer to gladly give up the reins of power while the Leader often notes that the team will be in excellent hands should he be absent after that.
On the other side of the coin, if the Lancer's dissent gets too out of hand, they're likely to go off on their own to do what they think is right.
Powers and skills common to the Lancer include:
This trope is named for the man-at-arms of The Middle Ages, the term for a professional soldier. While the term also encompasses the members of the knightly class, a man-at-arms was not necessarily a knight. They were also men of lesser financial and social status than knights, but were equally trained and equipped to fight on horseback in full armour and with sword and lance, just like their social superiors. In this regard, he is most recognizable as King Arthur's greatest warrior and right-hand man, Sir Kay, according to the source Welsh legends (and who was later demoted to comic relief).
On that note, if you were looking for a trope on the actual appearances and usage of lances, that's the Jousting Lance trope.
The Chick is usually the mediator between The Hero and the Lancer, making for a Power Trio (as well as a set-up for a Love Triangle). If it's a Love Triangle, the Lancer can either be the Hero's romantic rival or a potential love interest to contrast The Chick.
If given enough individual focus, the Lancer may become the Deuteragonist.
Not to be confused with Lancer in Carnival Phantasm, or Lancer in Deltarune."
t23159,ThemeNaming,"Authors like to use themes to create a sense of unity or cohesiveness within their work. Some extend themes to the names of the characters, often beyond the similarities that would be expected for characters from the same culture or who all speak the same language. When the author does this, you have Theme Naming. For instance, all the female characters will have names of flowers or plants (occasionally the male characters will get Gender Blender Names); all the names start with the same letter or syllable, groups of characters are named after groups of gods, demigods, or mythical heroes. As the list of subtropes demonstrates, there are a lot of possible themes (and that's not all of them, either)
The Recurring Extras, Those Two Guys and Creepy Twins sometimes have thematic names that link them. Theme naming is also common for characters with unusual names as a mnemonic in order to keep track of a huge cast; it's easier to keep track of which character is associated with which other characters if each group uses a theme.
Theme Naming can also be a Genius Bonus if it involves puns or other types of wordplay, names or words from languages other than the language the work is written in, or multiple layers of meaning in the name, or alternate or changed spellings.

Variations:
Subtropes include:
This page is for examples that don't really fit into any of the above subtropes. Those that do should be placed on the appropriate subtrope's page.
See also Meaningful Name, Prophetic Names, Who's on First?, Steven Ulysses Perhero, Names Given to Computers, and This Is My Name on Foreign. See Idiosyncratic Episode Naming for titles."
t23192,TheMole,"A bad guy who pretends to be a good guy. Their job is to gather intel for the Big Bad and thus limit the effectiveness of the hero's side. The audience assumes they are a good guy until the sudden revelation. If well-done, catches the audience out. If especially well-done, it can be the climax of a Wham Episode.
There will frequently be a showdown with the Mole, who then may return to the series from time to time when the writers want to bump up ratings. Alternatively, if the Mole doesn't know they have been identified, the heroes can feed them false information. Their cover story usually is a Conveniently Unverifiable Cover Story.
A Mole who happens to be the only person the hero can turn to for expert assistance is the Treacherous Advisor. If the mole is a Sixth Ranger for The Team then they're a Sixth Ranger Traitor. If the Mole helps pull off The Caper, it becomes an Inside Job.
If one of the heroes had been in a romantic relationship with the Mole before The Reveal, he or she may ask ""Was It All a Lie?"" Particularly heartless Moles may reveal that yes, I Was Only Pretending To Like You, while others may have indeed developed feelings for the person being betrayed and may wind up Becoming the Mask.
Compare Evil All Along, in which the character was secretly evil, but may not have been reporting to a villain in particular.
A really successful example can even become the Mole in Charge.
Unholy Holy Sword is this trope applied to an artifact, weapon, or MacGuffin. Ten Little Murder Victims is an example of a plot concerning the hunt for The Mole. A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing is The Mole via false identity. Flock of Wolves is a group where everyone is The Mole.
If The Mole is also a fake Heel–Face Turn, they're a Heel–Face Mole. If someone isn't The Mole, but it looks like they are, they’re a Red Herring Mole.
Reverse Mole is the reverse, a good guy who's been pretending to be a bad guy. (See also The Infiltration for the short-term version.)
Compare Big Bad Friend (an actual friend who is nevertheless a villain), Turncoat and Les Collaborateurs. Contrast Friendly Enemy (a known villain who is nevertheless a friend) and Face–Heel Turn (where the character was good, but changed sides).
Not to be confused with the Reality TV series of the same name (though it's all about this trope), The Mole from Thunderbirds (which is a digging machine), the Dick Tracy villain, Mole Men, Mole Miner, 6.02 x 1023,note a unit of measure known in chemistry as a ""mole"" Beauty Mark, or the Mexican chocolate sauce.
Be alert that spoilers may follow, due to the secretive nature of this character."
t23221,TheNecrocracy,"It's the literal version of Skeleton Government. That is, a government staffed by actual undead: liches, vampires, undead spirits and the like. The main variations are whether the subjects are also all or mostly undead, and whether the nation as a whole is good-aligned, evil-aligned, or neutral.
Malevolent examples are frequently used as The Horde (although living subjects might be more sympathetic). Non-malevolent examples are usually Dark Is Not Evil, oftentimes with a dash of Not Evil, Just Misunderstood. If you come across a city or fortress named Necropolis (Greek for ""city of the dead"") in a fantasy setting, chances are you're dealing with this trope. Stay away from these places.
A Necrocracy usually comes in one of several flavors:
If they have a military structure, the mooks are probably undead too.
A Sorcerous Overlord who is also a Lich would be an example, as is a Magocracy of undead wizards. Societies led by Vampire Monarchs also qualify. See also Immortal Ruler."
t23253,TheOlderImmortal,"In a group of immortals, (or very Long-Lived people) there will be at least one who is considerably older than any of the others. If most of them are 200 years old, one will be 600, or 1000. If most are 600 or 1000 years old, one will be 2000 or 3000 years old. And so on, possibly to Time Abyss status. These are The Older Immortal.
This way you can have age contrasts and generational tropes between people when all of them are really old. After all, it's hard to pull off The Patriarch in a family of immortals unless you're a good deal older than the rest. It can also be used for comedy or misdirection if the oldest looks the youngest.
Not to be confused with Elderly Immortal, an immortal who appears physically old, who may or may not fit this trope."
t23309,ThePeterPrinciple,"When people in a sufficiently large hierarchy are promoted because of their competence, the end result will tend to put everyone into a position for which they are not competent.
In other words, the cream will rise until it sours.
The theory behind the Peter Principle is this: when Alice is competent in her position, she will be promoted to another position because of her competence. Alice may or may not be competent at that new position. If she is incompetent, then she will become ineligible for promotion and stay put; she will be kept in that position indefinitely, even if there are other positions in the hierarchy which may suit her skills. The workers who are competent will keep being promoted for as long as they are competent and there are open slots above; they will be promoted out of the positions they are competent in but kept in the position they fail at. Since the only way to stay in a position below the top of the hierarchy indefinitely is to be incompetent, the hierarchy will eventually stabilize into an organization that is mostly incompetent.
This often results when the skills required to do a job well are very different from those required to manage people doing that job, from the military to education to sales. A classic example is a teacher being promoted into a principal - two jobs that require vastly different skillsets, yet the latter is one of the few obvious career paths for the former.
The name comes from the book by Dr. Laurence J. Peter, which is about this principle and discusses it in about twelve chapters worth of detail.
The counterpoint is The Dilbert Principle, which states that incompetent workers will always be promoted first (into inconsequential middle management positions), in order to keep them from interfering with the efforts of the competent, and is said to be a reaction to the identification of this trope (but if the competent ones want to be promoted, they'll suffer a Passed-Over Promotion).
It's a common cause of the Pointy-Haired Boss and Modern Major General. The Career-Building Blunder is one method of defying this trope.
Compare and contrast Brain Drain, Kicked Upstairs (arguably an invocation of the trope), and Unfit for Greatness."
t23339,ThePowerOfLove,"The Power Of Love is a curious thing. It makes one man weep, and another man sing. It can change a hawk to a little white dove. Bring inanimate objects to life. It might just save your life. It makes people want to give up personal freedom to belong to each other. Don't you dare mock it, it's more than a feeling, that's the Power of Love.
Even more than The Power of Friendship, the Power of Love can be applied in dire situations to make things better. In fact, in many Disney movies it's the solution to everything. Unlike The Power of Friendship it can be applied in Fan Fic to make things profoundly disturbing. It's also an occasionally useful Deus ex Machina.
Common applications of the Power of Love include activating an Empathic Weapon, freeing a loved one from mind control, strengthening a loved one, and converting a Real Death into a Disney Death. Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set such that the audience is left with the impression that it was ""really responsible"".
Don't You Dare Pity Me! can sometimes be overcome by the Power Of Love; however, it may take time, and the love itself must be purified of any pity it does contain.
The Green-Eyed Monster may come into play. In more idealistic shows, it is a sign of an immature love, where trust and faith is insufficient. However, more cynical shows may treat it as normal, and even let it overcome Cannot Spit It Out.
In cynical times, this can feel like a rip-off. It depends on where you, and the scene in question, fall on the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism.
Love Redeems evil but it can also turn you evil. Combining the two, it can support said baddies.
Sometimes, love for someone who's threatened can give someone a Heroic Second Wind, especially a Mama Bear/Papa Wolf.
A more passive but no less impressive display of the Power of Love is its ability to use the Red String of Fate to reunite the reincarnated lovers.
A Super-Trope to Heart Beat-Down, True Love's Kiss, The Love Slap of Epiphany. A Sister Trope to Light 'em Up (light based powers) and Holy Hand Grenade (holy powers) which are generally good. Compare Care-Bear Stare which includes all positive feelings (happiness, peace, love etc).
Compare and contrast with The Power of Lust. Contrast with The Power of Apathy and The Power of Hate. Occasionally classified as one of the Elemental Powers. Not to be confused with the fanfic."
t23399,TheReasonYouSuckSpeech,"One character delivers a speech to another character on all the reasons why that other character sucks or is a horrible person. There are several contexts in which this can happen.
Compare and contrast the ""World of Cardboard"" Speech, which may incorporate elements of this. See also Did You Actually Believe...? and You're Nothing Without Your Phlebotinum. Put to music, this can become a ""The Villain Sucks"" Song or ""The Hero Sucks"" Song.
Contrast Minor Insult Meltdown, where just the tip of the ""you suck"" iceberg can sink a character to tears. Contrast also You Are Better Than You Think You Are and Grade System Snark.
As a last note; no, this isn't the trope that's about the reasons that characters are bad at speaking. Neither is it a meta Justification for This Loser Is You. Finally you'll find that some of these can be used to serve as Dare to Be Badass speeches as well."
t23423,TheReveal,"A key moment in most Gambit Pileup plots, when the heroes or the audience discover how the villains have been manipulating everyone. Can also be used to make a cliffhanger more dramatic. Myth Arc and Mind Screw series love springing these; Jigsaw Puzzle Plots pretty much require them. Eventually necessary for a Mysterious Employer.
The Reveal is in fact a rather easily explained trope. A lot of mystery stories wouldn't work without either the criminal or the detective explaining how the crime was committed, and a lot of other plots would leave people with more questions than answers if they never bothered to explain the plot to other characters... and by extension, the viewers. It's easy to explain it off-screen, but doing so would confuse the viewer and make them think they missed something.
A Super-Trope to Chair Reveal, Emerging from the Shadows, Identity Concealment Disposal, Liar Revealed, Narrator All Along, Really Royalty Reveal, The Summation, Theme Song Reveal, Tomato Surprise, and Undercover Cop Reveal.
If you're set up for this but it's then subverted by not revealing it, it's The Un Reveal. When made too obvious ahead of time, it's The Un-Twist or a Captain Obvious Reveal (depending on how it happens). If it comes out of nowhere and serves no purpose other than to be a twist, it's a Shocking Swerve and/or a case of The Dog Was the Mastermind. If the thing revealed is named in the title, then it's The Namesake. If a Driving Question is involved, this is where it's finally put to rest. If it happens in the first episode of a series, it's probably a First-Episode Spoiler. Can overlap with Remembered Too Late, Wham Episode and Wham Line.
Compare Internal Reveal when the audience was in the loop all along and only characters in-universe are taken by surprise.
Aristotle referred to it as anagnorisis (generally translated as ""discovery"" or ""recognition"") in his Poetics, making this one Older Than Feudalism."
t23491,TheSlacker,"Huh — wha? Describe Slacker here? But it’s like, early…late… in the morning… evening… something like that, anyways, why don’t one of you do the job of describing for me so I can get back to training my Pokemon?
A character, almost Always Male (at least in older works) somewhere between age 14-40, whose single Goal in Life is to get through existence with as little effort as possible. May be Book Dumb or Brilliant, but Lazy, but either way they'll take crap jobs rather than aspire to anything greater. Even there, they are often the Weasel Co-Worker. Are usually filthy pigs at home, and sometimes with regard to their personal hygiene as well. May also ingest copious amounts of marijuana, but this is not a necessity. Often part of an Odd Couple with a driven, ambitious Neat Freak.
There are two things they might put effort into: appearing cool to peers, and trying to have sex.
Another thing to note is that most slacker stories tend to have a strong point of view: either the slacker is a lovable goof who's better than the Type A personalities around them, or he's an irresponsible asshole who needs to shape up.
Slacker girls are rare in fiction (and are often presented as essentially an oxymoron); generally the Slacker's girlfriend (or would be girlfriend) will be much more focused and getting on with her life. She might break up with him if she is able to see that he is going nowhere fast. However this gender split seems to be weakening as of The New '10s with films like Bad Teacher and Young Adult showing female slacker leads.
See also: Dismotivation, NEET, The Stoner. Compare Lazy Bum. Contrast Professional Slacker."
t23496,TheSmartGuy,"This is the one on The Team that uses their head.
They are always be prepared, sometimes Crazy-Prepared. Even under pressure they can whip up a plan at a moments notice. The Smart Guys will be at the computer doing Rapid-Fire Typing. Expect some fancy talk and Techno Babble from these characters. Because their role is about ideas they initially leave the action stuff to the others. Of course, Weak, but Skilled is always in effect for these guys.
Physically if not tall and skinny, the Smart Guys are usually short and wear glasses. They may even be a Child Prodigy. The Smart Guy is sometimes written as mousey and withdrawn. If not antisocial, at least non-social, sliding into TV Genius. Can be expected to play a mean game of chess.
Sometimes the Smart Guys are more street savvy than they appear. If this is the case it usually makes The Smart Guy physically as well as mentally capable. This is the path of the Badass Bookworms, or those who Minored In Ass Kicking. They remain firmly planted as the Smart Guy, but are just as ready to fight as everyone else. The results are often impressive, and usually have the advantage of surprise. Who expects the little guy with glasses to be an asskicker?
With a personality range from the introverted and weird TV Genius, the highly technical Spock, to the improbably cool Hollywood Nerd, the smart guy is better defined by the skills he brings to the table rather how he acts. Common types that you can mix and match on your way to Omnidisciplinary Scientist are:
Other common powers include:
In terms of relationships, The Smart Guy may be part of a Little Guy, Big Buddy duo with The Big Guy. They also make great sidekicks or advisors to The Leader, without all the potential conflict a full Lancer brings.
As casts have become more gender-balanced, The Smart Girl is the one most likely to swap genders. Since the character type is not stereotypically masculine, turning them into The Smart Girl is not a big stretch. During The New '10s, the prevalence of media partnerships with STEM also encouraged many a Smart Girl especially for the Gadgeteer Genius and coding archetypes.
In an ensemble, the Smart Guy is usually the last character to have a Love Interest if they even bother to give him one at all. When they do, expect a subplot about the geek's unrequited feelings towards an unattainable cooler love interest for Smart Guys around the same age as the rest of the cast. Younger Smart Guys may have a cute Puppy Love plot with someone their own age, or a Precocious Crush on someone much older. In most cases where the geek's love interest is not ""out of their league"", they tend to be little more than a Distaff Counterpart.
If there's a Robot Buddy or an alien on the team, he's usually The Smart Guy.
If the Smart Guy happens to be big and strong, he has enough of The Big Guy elements to be a Genius Bruiser. Otherwise, he's a Badass Bookworm.
If you're looking for his Evil Counterpart, regardless of team structure, that's The Evil Genius.
Oh, and he's also part of the Four-Man Band in a comedy ensemble.
Not to be confused with the series Smart Guy."
t23504,TheSociopath,"The Sociopath is far from your ordinary criminal or villain. Combine a willingness to cross the Moral Event Horizon without a shred of guilt, a keen sense of other people's mental and emotional fault lines, and a Lack of Empathy, and you have the consummate evildoer. To put it briefly, the Sociopath is like a predator while everyone else is prey to them.
The Sociopath displays these following qualities:
Under such circumstances, high-functioning examples will obey social norms to the extent necessary to sustain their hedonistic lifestyle while more low-functioning examples will react with unrestrained hostility towards anything resembling a challenge to their ""freedom"". Likewise, sociopaths are incapable of acknowledging personal responsibility for any failures or disappointments they encounter (i.e: events which they automatically attribute to those out to ""keep them down"" or unfortunate twists of fate entirely beyond their control).
Many of these traits are shared with other disorders, but it's the combination of them all that creates the true Sociopath. And, like many other disorders, sociopathy falls on a spectrum. Some sociopaths are just unusually self-absorbed. On the other end of the scale are the ruthless, remorseless and totally insane monsters. Sociopaths also have varying levels of intelligence, and goals, which influences how their disorder manifests in everyday life. Some sociopaths just want a family - but the very best, most happy family, and only to reflect well on them and make them happy. At any cost. For example if another family member is 'spoiling' this dream, they may simply dispose of that person, and lack empathy and can't see why they might be at fault.
The high-functioning Sociopath will usually have better-than-average impulse control for someone with their condition, and may actually appear perfectly normal for years. They know murder is bad because they're told it's bad — and know murderers who are caught will get in trouble — but the action has no more emotional weight to them than brushing their teeth. They emulate the moral behaviour of society only because a failure to do so has negative consequences, and not because Good Feels Good. What You Are in the Dark exposes them for who they are, and they do not consider something wrong if they do not get caught. If killing advances their goals more easily and they can get away with it, they will often do so. And they will often seek positions of respectability within their communities in order to maintain the façade of being just like everybody else.
They might even go their whole lives appearing almost normal... but there will always be something a little ""off"" about them; something cold and distant and fake. And they won't even care. This type can make a terrifying Knight Templar, liable to believe that Utopia Justifies the Means — some sociopathic serial killers claim they are simply a Necessary Evil removing undesirable elements from society or making a political statement. They may understand intellectually that their actions are undesirable in society at large, but feel that they should be rewarded, not punished, for acting to solve a perceived problem.
The low-functioning version is defined mostly by their impulse control being particularly shoddy, or having a personality type that predisposes them to violent behavior. For them, maintaining the façade of ""fitting in"" is simply impossible, as their violent outbursts make them highly visible. But even a low-functioning Sociopath can be glib and charming, the perfect liar, allowing them to accrue loyal followers who perceive their behavior as revolutionary and secretly having a higher purpose. The sociopath will see these followers as useful pawns at best, however, and will not return any of their loyalty in kind, though they may pretend to when it suits them.
Not all sociopaths lust for world domination, of course. Your every-day low-functioning sociopath may just want to get their next hit of crack, and not only will they go to any lengths but they won't feel bad about the distress they cause others by being an addict. Addicts do a lot to fund their addiction, but a non-sociopath will feel bad enough about it to eventually seek help to quit for the sake of others, while a sociopath doesn't give a crap. They're too great to overdose, they're not going to get caught (regardless of how little effort they put into not getting caught), and they don't get why others would get worried about what they're doing to their body or the whole family because they wouldn't care about them.
One important thing to note is that even family members and long-term 'friends' are not excused from these behaviors. Even their own children mean nothing to the Sociopath. They too are tools to be used and tossed aside as soon as they reflect poorly on the sociopath or get in their way. If a character cares about anybody other than themselves; if they can hesitate, they may be terrifyingly, murderously ambitious, but they have empathy for others, and by extension they are not a sociopath. It has been noted that many sociopaths like animals, though.
If the Sociopath has standards, there's a good chance those standards are either carefully calculated to manipulate others, or incidental to the sociopath's personality type. Often, their lack of emotional investment in any kind of moral code or ideology can strike a person with more typical psychological makeup as Blue and Orange Morality.
The canonical alignment for many Sociopaths is Chaotic Evil of the Type 4 variety, though some Neutral Evil examples exist under the Type 3 variety. Lawful Evil Sociopaths are possible.
The Sociopath has become a very popular villain-type in recent years; crime dramas and thrillers, for example, will inevitably feature one as a particularly merciless and evil antagonist. Some tropes that are frequently associated with The Sociopath include Serial Killer, Faux Affably Evil, Lack of Empathy, The Unfettered, Manipulative Bastard, The Chessmaster and The Übermensch. Many Psychos For Hire, The Soulless, and believers in For the Evulz are this as well. If the Sociopath happens to be a ruler, and considers themselves above the law, then expect them to be The Caligula or worse, Jerkass Gods. If a character qualifies as a Complete Monster, there's a good chance that this trope applies to them. Compare Sociopathic Hero, Comedic Sociopathy, Moral Sociopathy. Contrast the Narcissist, who has the grandiose ego and Lack of Empathy, but experiences the full range and intensity of human emotion, and is capable of love — even if it's a very one-sided, selfish kind of love.
The trope is named following an old edition of the DSM which used the term to refer to what is now classed as Antisocial personality disorder. Though the terms sociopathy and psychopathy are still recognized in some circles, they have no official standing. See Analysis and UsefulNotes.Lack Of Empathy for more detailed information.
Note: very few fictional sociopaths — even the ones identified as such by the work itself — would be considered as such by a real-life psychiatrist. This is because, as Robert Hare points out in his book Without Conscience, sociopaths by definition are two-dimensional characters, lacking an ability to have anything resembling Character Development (not to mention that people who have the full range of human emotions may find it near impossible to conceive of a human being that truly lives without them). The biggest indication that a fictional character may score high on the psychopath checklist is antisocial behavior (whether violent or nonviolent) coupled with their loyalty or affection to other characters being dubious at best. So if a character has a Morality Pet, Morality Chain, or a deep attachment to a family member or leader that goes beyond simple practicality, it's a good bet this trope doesn't apply to the character."
t23532,TheStoic,"He can be in the middle of a gunfight, his best friend's bachelor party, or a helpless witness to the death of everyone and everything he holds dear... and he'll show all the emotional reaction of a victim of a Botox overdose. They can be Heroes, antagonists or anti-heroes. On The Team he will contrast the Hot-Blooded. His quiet demeanor tends towards the brusque or outright rudeness, though there are a few polite Stoics. Some stoics may try to give the impression of a lot going on inside, cultivate an air of mystery and confuse other characters with cryptic one-liners.
The Stoic sometimes displays emotion when under extreme stress or in other highly emotional situations, but their usual repertoire consists of mild boredom, detached interest, Dull Surprise or dignified disdain. He may be a Deadpan Snarker, or have No Sense of Humor. If he ever shows true emotion, it's likely to be explosive in its intensity or incredibly subtle and full of Emotional Torque. The tougher sort of stoic may hide it so thoroughly that only his Bad Dreams show any of it. Opposed to Frozen Face, where the emotions appear absent because they do not alter his expression, even in highly emotional situations. A few stoics might calmly pipe up that they have feelings and opinions too, they just aren't effusive about it.
Masculine pronouns are used throughout this trope because quiet women in fiction tend to be the Emotionless Girl or Stoic Woobies. Men who use stoicism to hide their pain are more likely to indulge in mangst. Either way, expect them to be the phlegmatic member of their group.
The Stoic is not necessarily The Quiet One. While the Stoic may be low key and quiet, more often than not he's just as talkative as anyone else. Another difference is that while The Quiet One does feel and display emotion (albeit less vocally and regularly, and makes up for it with deeper pathos), the Stoic is so devoid of any semblance of human emotion that he borders on being a true Tin Man. Whether he has emotion or not varies, but he will invariably refuse to ever show it.
Stoics can have all alignments, but if they're not evil but really don't care about anyone and anything, they're True Neutral. They're hardly ever chaotic, however.
There are three types:
This last one has real world examples in Flat affect, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Shell Shock.
The silent warrior has roots stretching back to The Drifter in Westerns and farther back. The Stoics in ancient Greece were philosophers who believed that self-control is the highest virtue, and detachment from strong emotions and passion would give them greater insight in their quest for truth. They also thought that emotional reactions to the inevitable were silly; given that We All Die Someday, what is grieving over death but a judgment that the inevitable was somehow wrong? Stoics would later be criticized for denying themselves and others any kind of earthly pleasure or silliness in life.
Characters of this type include:
Other tropes associated with stoics include:
Note: Just because the person is Stoic doesn't mean that person is a Jerkass or pessimistic.
Contrast/Compare with Loveable Rogue, Become a Real Boy, The McCoy and Gentle Giant. On the far end of Emotions vs. Stoicism. If a person deliberately inflicts pain on himself to show it doesn't bother him, that's Macho Masochism.
Contrast Rage Breaking Point, Drama Queen. If someone attempts to be stoic but fails and breaks up into laughter, that's called Corpsing note so named because the worst time to lose your composure if you're an actor is when you're playing a corpse."
t23628,TheVamp,"A classic character type, the beauty who uses her feminine wiles to undermine a moral and upright man, for evil purposes. She's evil and sexy, a liar and a sneak, and uses the good guy's sympathy against him, often with a sob story about her mother and some hospital bills or a Wounded Gazelle Gambit.
Unlike the Femme Fatale and the Mad Scientist's Beautiful Daughter, and even the Dark Feminine, she is rotten to the core, and will never be swayed from the path of darkness by love. (In eras where Make-Up Is Evil applies, expect her to paint when no other woman does.)
The name comes from Rudyard Kipling's 1897 poem ""The Vampire."" It was popularized by the 1915 silent film A Fool There Was, which quoted liberally from the Kipling poem. It quickly became a trope of classic silent films, where this character is part of a standardized plot. A red-blooded American boy must choose between his familiar, cutesy-plain sweetheart and this seductress.
This trope is Cyclic. In certain eras, as with the ""hat dichotomy"" from Westerns, but more actual in fact, The Vamp is almost always black-haired, whereas the good girl is a blonde. In the Cold War era, the raven-haired temptress was a Soviet spy, when not just a torturer like The Baroness. At other times, blondes are inherently more evil. And of course, always keep an eye out for an Evil Redhead or two in the mix.
Is often the Lady in Red.
Although the name is derived from ""vampire,"" this character is most commonly a normal human, but some supernatural entities are known to influence men in this way. Succubi and Sirens are known to lure men in to be eaten or drained of Life Force, or occasional literal vampires use their supernatural beauty and wit to lure male prey to their deaths, for example.
Expect some praying mantis imagery for these characters, as female mantises have been known to eat their mates' heads after mating (although the prevalence of this habit is greatly exaggerated in the media).
Compare with the Femme Fatale, the somewhat more sympathetic (and less sexual) version of this character (which may overlap with this trope if the character has an ambiguous agenda), and The Casanova. Often overlaps with the Black Widow, who is just a particularly successful Vamp, and Gold Digger, who is motivated by greed for the target's wealth. See also Villainesses Want Heroes. Literal Man Eater is when this character swallows the men she seduces.
Contrast with the Heroic Seductress, The Vamp's direct Counter Trope, who uses sex for noble and heroic purposes. Also contrast the Proper Lady, who saves it for her own man.
Not to be confused with the other Vamp."
t23629,TheVerse,"The ’Verse is usually referred to with a show or franchise identifier (such as Buffyverse, Whoniverse, etc.). It is a crafted combination of setting-elements that define the rules for how the world works and sometimes provides for sharing of characters and continuity across more than one series. A Shared Universe refers to a fictional universe with multiple authors.
In terms of how things work within the universe, the Buffyverse for example is set up by Mutant Enemy in such a way that Our Vampires Are Different in a (fairly) uniform fashion, and certain characters can move back and forth between shows and refer to events on the other show as if they are in the same world. Such things are often defined in the Universe Bible, the one true repository of canon. These bibles may be condensed to a Universe Compendium, or published as a Universe Concordance. Some universes, the shared variety especially, have a pretty strict and orderly Canon. Others, especially those with many authors, spread across different media and over a long period of time, go all over the place. Most of them reside somewhere in-between.
Many 'verses have a thriving life in Expanded Universe form and spawn Tie In Novels, movies, comics and fanfic. However, these spin-offs may or may not count as Canon.
It is interesting to note that Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction credits Orson Scott Card as the inventor of this term. He, however, says someone simply put the word Enderverse on a book jacket, and Card was credited for it. ""The thing is, I hate that word. I didn't coin that word. And yet because it's on the title of a book of mine, my name is attached as if I made it up."" It is more likely then that the Trope Namer is Firefly (See below for details). An earlier term coined by Robert A. Heinlein, ficton, has never gained much currency outside of Science Fiction circles; similarly, the related (but subtly different) term mythopoeia is mostly known to fans of J. R. R. Tolkien, who coined the term 1930s.
One notable thing about the creation of Crossover verses is that it is usually easy to link two or more works which contain no Speculative Fiction elements or major departures from actual history, but doing so with Speculative Fiction works can be difficult because the settings are more likely to contradict each other. For instance, the characters from two Dom Coms, or two Westerns, or even a Dom Com and an action drama can typically all bump into each other with no logical problem. But to declare that, say, Star Trek and Babylon 5 exist in the same world is very awkward because both have detailed future histories, catalogs of nearby alien races, and rules about physical laws which bear little to no resemblance to each other. This can be a headache for s.f. franchises (Hi, DC!) who try to merge unrelated verses together into a single whole.
Quite often confused with Shared Universe. A Shared Universe refers to a fictional universe written by more than just one or two real-world creators or authors. Also not to be confused with Expanded Universe which refers to a kind of secondary canon to the main Canon, in other media. See also the closely related term Canon. See also Canon Welding, Alternate Continuity and Intra-Franchise Crossover. And while we'd hope this doesn't need to be noted, it should probably be said anyway: a Shout-Out, Production Throwback, or any casual referencing between two works on their own does not mean they inhabit a verse. If that were that case, nearly every single piece of fiction would inhabit the same universe, and the Tommy Westphall Multiverse Hypothesis is enough of a headache as it is.
Speaking of, this page concerns the concept behind a single universe, where many franchises (or individual facets of one franchise) exist in the same reality. For a multitude of universes, realities and timelines; see The Multiverse."
t23938,TimeAbyss,"There are the old, and then there are the truly old. People usually die within a century or so. Cities and nations may last a few millennia, and we think them old, but the truly old are so much older.
They were already old when all the nations we know were born, even those now vanished into history. They can speak of Ancient Athens and Babylon as casually as we might speak of yesterday, for to them those ancient cities are but recent memories. They were there when brick was first laid on brick, over five thousand years ago. They may have watched the trilobites come, and go, with eyes older than the stars. They may even be older than time itself.
Contemplating such immense spans of time is like looking into an abyss, an inducement to vertigo, for they are more than we can grasp. Oh, we can talk about them easily enough, just more big numbers, but we can't intuit them. We all know what a second or a week feels like; a million years (or even ten thousand) is beyond all human experience. It is from this incomprehension that this trope draws its power, when done right, an evocation of incomprehensible age that appeals to our sense of wonder. Naturally, a Time Abyss must experience all the years they claim. It doesn't count if they skip over or sleep through them.
While a Time Abyss is normally a person — perhaps not technically human, but a person nonetheless — objects can also qualify, everything from cities to coins. Imagine an alien monolith that has been sitting on the moon for three billion years. Think about all it has seen; the slow dance of the continents, the long march of evolution, the sudden flowering of civilization. Think, and wonder.
Geographical features can't qualify, though. We expect the hills to be old as dirt. We do not expect people, or any of their works, to be older than the hills.
Five thousand years or so is a decent estimate of the minimum age needed to qualify for this trope, excluding any hypothetical immortal caveman, and yet, in Science Fiction, a Time Abyss will typically be far older than that. Geological time scales are usually involved. In modern-day works of a religious bent (or not), Adam and Eve (or Cain) are likely candidates, as the first ever living sapient creatures.
A god or major Eldritch Abomination is often a time abyss, as are Precursors and Elves (depending on how much better the elves are, many aren't old enough to follow this trope). These characters may decide that there's Nothing Left to Do but Die because Who Wants to Live Forever?. May even oscillate between Living Forever Is Awesome and bored eternity.
Meta-trope of Living Relic, where the being in question finds themselves the last survivor of their civilization, race, or even species long after their kind has become myth. Being a Time Abyss will often lead to a work's creator wanting to engage in some Exposition of Immortality to show just how much they remember.
See Time Skip for when a long time has passed between two events."
t23967,TimeSkip,"A Time Skip is similar to the Distant Finale, but rather than coming at the end of a series, occurs somewhere in the middle, usually between seasons or Story Arcs. A Time Skip can also happen when a series gets a sequel that picks up after the Distant Finale. Naturally, this occurs far more in animated series and comics than in live action, unless a long period of time passes in real life. A mid-series Time Skip in a manga usually causes a break between series in the anime adaptation. It's also a common point in the story for filler to be fitted in.
A Time Skip also provides another advantage for animated series that isn't necessary for live-action series: after a certain number of episodes have passed it looks more and more ridiculous that the characters haven't aged, however, animation doesn't really allow for the extremely subtle effect of gradual aging. Thus, the best way to show aging has happened is to jump ahead to when they're older.
A Time Skip usually takes no less than three years, and may indicate a shift in the Competence Zone, or at least the characters' place in it. The Official Couple now has a kid, the kid sister... Wow! She Is All Grown Up! When a time skip occurs in a Shōnen anime or manga, you can bet that almost the entire cast will have Taken a Level in Badass.
Time Skips can cause/result in a dramatic shift in the tone of a series, especially if the main characters were kids or teenagers. Alternately, it can be a ""The Next Generation"" situation, with the children of the previous protagonists taking up the mantle of their parents. A common device of such a variation has the previous protagonists realizing that they now have to put up with the same shenanigans they put their own parents/commanding officers through.
A time skip may be used as well to link the Origin Story and the story itself, when the story does not take place immediately after the origin. Instead of using a Flashback within the main story, the story details the origin story at the beginning and provides a ""many years later"" screen to jump to the main story.
Tends to be used as a follow up to a Wham Episode.
Often leads to Ridiculously Successful Future Self for one or more characters.
In a story that runs on Webcomic Time, an occasional periodic Time Skip is almost a requirement to keep the time frame current with the real world. Some don't bother. Alternatively, multiple time skips can be chained together in any medium to produce a story with a larger time span at the expense of insignificant events between major plot turns — see Dashed Plot Line.
Thanks to the nature of time flowing forward and that ugly process known as ""aging"", live-action works can use a Time Skip to help make Role Reprises feasible in the event of a Sequel Gap.
Longer time skips tend to be a round number of years. See also: Offstage Waiting Room. And check for eyepatches. If the Time Skip is especially lengthy, see Distant Sequel.
A Time Skip that doesn't get covered in enough detail tends to be prime Fanfic Fuel.
Contrast Spin-Off Babies, which instead makes the characters younger."
t24005,TitledAfterTheSong,"A show/movie (music videos don't count) titled after a pre-existing song, i.e. not something written in conjunction with the show/movie. If it's not the song's real title, it's something one could Refrain from Assuming it was.
Closely related to Literary Allusion Title. See also Idiosyncratic Episode Naming, of which this is a form (when applied to TV series episodes, naturally). See also Title Track, when an album is titled after a song that's actually on it."
t24006,TitleDrop,"If a line of dialogue is the title of the episode, movie, or book, it obviously must have some great significance. If it sounds completely random, that just means the true meaning of the title has yet to be revealed. So when a character is heard using the title in dialogue, the audience sits up and takes notice, because the scriptwriter has just planted a neon sign that flashes THIS CONVERSATION IS IMPORTANT.
Note: If a series is named after a central character, setting, group, etc., it does not count as a Title Drop, unless they are usually called by another name. Hence, Transformers, The West Wing, House, and things like that don't qualify, and are better examples of the trope Exactly What It Says on the Tin. Often, the Title Drop will finally explain why the episode/book/etc is called that way to begin with. If this explanation comes by showing instead of by telling (i.e. it is not actually spoken aloud by any of the characters), then it's The Namesake.
A second variety of Title Drop is the Finale Title Drop, occurs when the title of a work is used as the last line spoken or near its end. Here, it's not nearly as big and flashy and important as the first variety, but it still explains things to the audience a bit more. You can probably find these mainly in thriller works, where it makes you sit up and think (and adds a bit of drama to the ending). It's also common in plays that were written during the Victorian era. A third variety is Title Drop Chapter, in which a chapter of a written work or an episode of a serial work has the same title as the whole work; this often is used for important developments. A fourth variety is the Visual Title Drop in which the title may be represented visually, in a particular shot composition or by placing a particular object in the frame; this is most often used in the same way, to draw attention to something important or to emphasize a theme.
Title Drops aren't always deliberate or premeditated (i.e. the writer takes the title and inserts it for effect). Sometimes the creative process runs the other way, and a phrase from the body of the work will be picked out and used as the title (sometimes the title is the last thing to be nailed down).
Compare with Justified Title, Title Theme Tune. See also Arc Words, Appropriated Appellation, Title Scream, Singer Namedrop, and Album Title Drop. Often combined with a Literary Allusion Title. The opposite of this trope is Non-Appearing Title, but see also Nonindicative Name and Word Salad Title for titles that are very obscure, confusing, or abstract, with little obvious connection to the subject matter. When a title of a series was once accurate and descriptive, but has since become obscure or out-of-date, it has an Artifact Title.
See a video collection of Title Drops here and here."
t24077,TomboyAndGirlyGirl,"When the main characters in a show are both females, or if there are only Two Girls to a Team, it almost always leads to a case of this trope. The ""Girly Girl"" will highly care about her appearance, pursue ""girly"" interests, and is often (though not always) The Chick. The ""Tomboy"", who is often The Big Girl, will be into sports, mechanics, house and/or building construction and/or renovation, or the like. She couldn't care less about her hair or makeup but is often an Unkempt Beauty anyway. Like their Spear Counterparts, Sensitive Guy and Manly Man, they are candidates for an Odd Couple and Odd Friendship brought together in the attempt to make hilarity ensue.
The two ladies will have some sort of relationship with each other, whether they're best friends, sisters, on the same team, or even explicit lovers. Even when they aren't explicit lovers, this may lead to deliberate or accidental Homoerotic Subtext due to the overlap with the Masculine–Feminine Gay Couple stereotype. If they're together for reasons outside their control (i.e., part of a team), they might initially dislike or confuse each other with their ways, until the inevitable Girls' Night Out Episode forces them to put aside their differences and forge a common bond (note: if there are more than two girls in the group, these two must have some kind of relationship over the others). When one is the mother of the other, the mother will almost always be the girly girl, and the daughter will almost always be the tomboy.
It may lead to Fan Dumb or Hate Dumb if one is portrayed as being ""better"" than the other, if the girly girl is portrayed as shallow or less strong, or if the tomboy is portrayed as a cold man-hater or even ambiguously lesbian for taking a less traditional gender role. Works that involve Values Dissonance are particularly vulnerable to this. At its most extreme, it reinforces the Men Are Generic, Women Are Special mindset, where males on the team have varied personalities unrelated to their gender (due to maleness being seen as worthless) while the females are defined by their femininity or lack thereof (thus limiting their characterization and role variety).
Keep in mind that just because a girl is a tomboy, regardless of whether she is butch or effeminate, does not necessarily mean that she is a lesbian. Both types of tomboys can be straight, gay, or bisexual, and both types of girly girls, proper and moderate, can also be straight, gay, or bisexual.
Compare the mannish one and the sweet-naive one of the Four-Girl Ensemble.
Compare/contrast Bifauxnen and Lad-ette (the equivalent of this trope, only without the girly girl involved), Light Feminine and Dark Feminine (the other equivalent, usually without the tomboy), and Masculine–Feminine Gay Couple (an equivalent involving a couple). Contrast Silk Hiding Steel, Spirited Young Lady, Girly Bruiser, Lady of War, and often Pretty Princess Powerhouse; all of which are a mixture of the two. When a third girl is part of the dynamic but does not fit in either category, then she's among the Town Girls (Butch, Femme and Neither).
Important Note: While this is usually a straightforward trope, examples can still get subjective in regards to whether or not one of the girls is tomboyish enough, the other is girly enough, or whether they're different enough. Keep a few points in mind when editing;"
t24108,TooDumbToLive,"There's simple ignorance, when you just didn't know something. There's catching the Idiot Ball, which is a momentary lapse. There's fear and panic in a chaotic situation. All those situations are understandable reasons for making poor decisions. So far, we're at What an Idiot!
Then there's these guys. People who are so stupid that they simply do not deserve to survive.

Compare Artificial Stupidity, the video game equivalent of this which is a result of AI rather than the script being against them. Contrast Death by Pragmatism and Let's Get Dangerous!. Not to be confused with Evilutionary Biologist or The Social Darwinist, although they generally consider it a Moral Event Horizon to not kill the dumb. See also Suicidal Overconfidence, another video game version. Lethally Stupid is when someone's stupidity simply causes havoc, instead of being the cause of their demise.
As this is a Death Trope, expect unmarked spoilers on the subpages.

t24251,TragicVillain,"A particular Deconstruction of the villain, a Tragic Villain is completely aware of their evil but takes little to no pleasure from it; in fact, they could very well resent the evil they are committing. Rather, they engage in evil due to circumstances beyond their control. In many circumstances they are the Tragic Monster, perhaps an innocent person transformed into a mindless monster, or simply created to be a monster; either way they have no choice in the evil acts they commit and are as sympathetic as their victims.
Or maybe a hero was forced to commit a necessary evil, and occasionally any kind of villainy against their will, and never forgave themselves, deciding they were now a villain beyond hope/not deserving of salvation or redemption, possibly becoming a Death Seeker in the process.
The Knight Templar is quite frequently portrayed as this; given that many of them are meant to mirror real-life figures. One who stops attacking potential rebels may realize how his orders are doing more wrong than right, but the side of good will never take him... there's no turning back from where he is standing. Of course that wouldn't stop a Knight Templar from coming to regret their actions.
Highly sympathetic ones may be Anti-Villains and prime candidates for redemption, but also everything associated. Compare to Well-Intentioned Extremist, who commits evil actions in hopes of producing good results. Also compare Byronic Hero, who is a similarly sympathetic but flawed and morally conflicted character. Overlaps with Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds when their destruction is a result of the extreme mistreatment they have endured. There's also Love Makes You Evil, where they act out of villainous actions, due to either losing the ones they love, or have never been loved before.
Contrast Complete Monster, a villain who is pure evil and devoid of humanizing qualities. (A Tragic Villain could become such if they lose their sympathetic traits or take actions that overwhelm said traits.)"
t24429,TrilogyCreep,"The strange tendency of trilogies to expand and see more and more works added to The ’Verse. Mainly found in books, but may also occur with movies.
SF author Orson Scott Card has suggested that this is the result of Executive Meddling; rather than allow an author to just write the books they want to write, publishers pressure them into producing sequel after sequel in order to take advantage of the preexisting fanbase and milk a Cash Cow Franchise bone-dry.
Two-Part Trilogy is somewhat related, typically the result of a one-part story expanding into a trilogy. Contrast Divided for Publication, which is when a work is split into more parts than the author originally envisioned, due to excessive length.
See also Franchise Zombie. Capcom Sequel Stagnation is a related trope for Video Games."
t24496,TrueCompanions,"True Companions are just like a real family — they may not necessarily like each other, or actually have liked each other at first, but they know they can depend upon each other in a crisis. It is a relationship considered to be deeper than mere friendship but more innocent than romance.
This sort of group dynamic appeals to younger audiences who are unfamiliar with romance, and appeals to older audiences who live in a world of complex relationships and convenience masqueraded as False Friendship, who are feeling nostalgic about the times when friendship meant a lifelong bond.
A writer may use this to avoid writing romantic relationships, though this usually doesn't stop fans from making up their own.
This trope was originally known as nakama, a Japanese word that means friends or companions.note You may have heard that it means something stronger, but that's a misconception. A popular One Piece fansub group left the term untranslated and asserted (incorrectly) it was untranslatable, creating the false impression that it had no good English equivalent while others may have translated “nakama” as “crew”.

Compare The Power of Friendship, A Friend in Need, Close-Knit Community, and Undying Loyalty. Contrast Enemy Mine, A House Divided, We ARE Struggling Together, Headbutting Heroes and occasionally Teeth-Clenched Teamwork.
Heterosexual Life-Partners and Platonic Life-Partners are this trope distilled down to a two-person group (same sex and opposite sex, respectively). Often, a group of characters become true companions after a Misfit Mobilization Moment. If the characters happen to be particularly badass, you get a Badass Crew.

t24578,TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture,"The Future, but not so far into it that you'd notice except for the abundance of Applied Phlebotinum. This is often a linear extrapolation of national malaise or existing crises, so American works of the 1970s have endlessly skyrocketing crime and inner urban decay note  true enough in places like Detroit, Michigan, but wildly wrong in general; cities like NYC are safer today than ever before  whereas the 1980s brought the notion that Mega Corps and Japan (especially Japanese megacorps) would rule the world. When the 1990s came around, the US economy recovered while the Japanese economy tanked; The Great Politics Mess-Up and subsequent collapse of many authoritarian communist regimes drastically changed the political picture of both the present and the future. Instead of criminal anarchy or corporate governance, there's a lot more focus on how technology has come to permeate everyday life and challenge long-held conceptions of the individual and society as a whole. And, of course, works in the '90s naturally assumed that from that point on the only murderous enemies Americans would have to worry about would be right-wing militia fanatics, homicidal teenagers, and maybe the occasional petty dictator — but no one else. With the Turn of the Millennium and the New Tens, the issue seems to have become extreme Right-Wing dystopias and/or endless American Interventionalism in the Middle East and Central Asia, occasionally spreading into South America, Africa, or Southeast Asia.
Obviously, 20 Minutes into the Future is the setting of most Flash Forward stories, though they usually don't make a big deal of it except as a minor joke. Of course, Science Marches On, so it's fun to watch 10 years later to see how wrong they got it. Television series are especially prone to this, as they tend to make use of various props, costumes, and effects that reflect the sensibilities of their time but become increasingly dated over a long run.
Both Max Headroom and Brazil lampshade the Zeerust problem by setting themselves explicitly ""20 Minutes into the Future"" and ""Somewhere in the Twentieth Century"", respectively (rather than identifying specific dates), and by mixing up production designs and costumes that would have been considered ""futuristic"" in the '80s with random elements from previous decades.
See also Next Sunday A.D., which is completely indistinguishable from the present, but claims to be happening in the future anyway. How much Applied Phlebotinum it takes to flip Next Sunday A.D. into full-scale Twenty Minutes into the Future is an interesting question, since many stories employing fictional technology are actually set in the present. Can result in I Want My Jetpack if the writers set the work not sufficiently far into the future, and the year the work was set in comes in real life without any of the new technology it featured. Compare to Urban Fantasy as the magical version. Inverted by 20 Minutes into the Past.
A good way to gauge whether or not a show takes place Twenty Minutes into the Future: would much of the world's population at the time of filming still be alive by then?"
t24584,TwiceShy,"When two characters are attracted to one another, but are both so incredibly shy and awkward that neither one of them has the guts to do anything about it. In the end all it usually takes is for someone (or something) else to give them a gentle nudge in the right direction and they'll get together.
The pair usually comprises a regular character and a Temporary Love Interest, but it can also be a Beta Couple with a Will They or Won't They? plot of their own. It may also involve some Dramatic Irony if the audience is made aware of the pair's mutual crush before they are.
Subtrope of Birds of a Feather. Compare with Belligerent Sexual Tension which also has trouble getting together, but for different reasons. May be a driving force behind Will They or Won't They?, Not to Be Confused with The First Cut Is the Deepest, a trope also described as ""once bitten, twice shy."""
t24585,TwiceToldTale,"Lots of works are based on earlier works.
Sometimes a story is not only based on it, but really requires you to know the earlier story to fully appreciate it, or even appreciate it at all. A Sleeping Beauty story where the princess turns out to be a vampire, for instance, is missing something if you don't realize that it's ""Sleeping Beauty"".
That is a Twice-Told Tale.
When the recognition of the original story is crucial, writers can work with only the most iconic stories for this. Usually public domain works for obvious reasons.
The Perspective Flip and External Retcon are subtropes. Fractured Fairy Tale may be, if it is fracturing a specific Fairy Tale rather than combining many fairy tales' characters, plots, and tropes. Many are parodies or satires, but it is not required. A twice told tale may or may not involve Grimmification, but rarely Disneyfication, since it requires knowledge of the original tale. Demythtification may involve a twice told tale if a mostly historical account is revealed to be the source of the legend.
This generally includes Fanfics. Fanfic writers like to say that those other works on the example are critically acclaimed fanfics, too. Some fanfic authors recommend trying to avert this, actually, and make the story as clear as possible to the uninitiated.
The trope's name comes from William Shakespeare's King John:
Compare and contrast Whole Plot Reference."
t24631,TwoLinesNoWaiting,"Two narrative threads—or more—are woven together; two cases are prosecuted, two murders investigated, and so on. This allows a simple narrative structure to feel as if it has more variety. It gives the audience a break from one line and something to do in terms of recalling the events of the alternate line. The two stories may be about similar subjects, or one may be the usual fare (investigations, prosecutions) interleaved with character development that gives a sense of a Story Arc. Crime shows or films often feature parallel stories whose heroes turn out to be Working the Same Case.
Juggling two stories is common enough that writers frequently refer to the ""A Story"" and the ""B Story"". Three or more is quite a bit less common, at least in purely-episodic or limited-continuity shows.
If the B Story is clearly subservient to the A Story, it will usually be described as the ""subplot"". A common pattern on many series—sitcoms in particular—is that the same sets of characters will usually be segregated into ""main plot"" and ""subplot"" every week.
In arc-heavy fare, two or three recurring storylines may be hit along with one or two minor ""breather"" plotlines all at once. This just means less screen time for each plotline, which mean they all go on for more episodes, which means the viewers keep watching. This is common in Soaps, long-form dramas, and some Sci-Fi series.
If the A Story and B Story aren't juggled simultaneously, but are instead handled separately and tied together with an incredible chain of events, it's Halfway Plot Switch. If said chain of events is split over two time periods, it's Meanwhile, in the Future.... Often uses Plot Parallels to set up a Double Aesop.
A lighter version involves the protagonist's investigation running parallel to something more innocent. While the detective mom investigates the grisly subway killings, her kids investigate the mystery of the missing pizza slice. This allows for a freeze-framed laugh at the end when it's discovered the dog did it.note Ate the pizza, not butchered the commuters.
For a Soap Opera variation see Soap Wheel and Four Lines, All Waiting. Contrast Offstage Waiting Room. If one of the storylines seems utterly inconsequential compared to the other, you may have a case of Trapped by Mountain Lions. When a battle is starting in one storyline and the camera switches to another storyline, this is an example of a Charge-into-Combat Cut. See also Simultaneous Arcs, when the entirety of one arc is told before the next one gets told, but each one happens at the same time."
t24860,UnitedNationsIsASuperpower,"A fictional, 20 Minutes into the Future/Exty Years from Now/Alternate History version of the United Nations that possesses political, military and/or economic power on par with a world superpower (or even hyperpower).note And for the record, this means that the UN effectively answers to no government save its own, thus technically qualifying it for ""non-governmental organization"" status. Oftentimes, it operates and is structured like a huge federalized union of its member states. It could even take the next step: becoming a planetwide government.
As some of the examples below would suggest, Fun with Acronyms is practically a necessity.
In Real Life, the UN has no military force of its own, and acts primarily through sanctions, when its members can be made to agree on anything in the first place. Some of its detractors go so far as to say that the UN has no real authority whatsoever, although this view is usually held by those who oppose whatever view the majority of its members hold. UN ""military"" are generally peacekeeping forces made up of units and equipment volunteered from member nations. As a result, many instances of this trope require that the UN adjust its structure to become much more powerful; frequently there is some form of world-threatening crisis that demands a unified multi-national force under UN command that results in the UN becoming far stronger.
Compare Interpol Special Agent. See also N.G.O. Superpower, One World Order, and Fictional United Nations."
t24870,UniversalUniverseTime,"In most science fiction stories, although it is an issue that is seldom even touched upon, it appears that the entire Universe uses the same timekeeping and calendar system as Earth - years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, etc. Most planets also apparently experience a day/night cycle that is practically identical to that of Earth.
This is, of course, completely ignoring the fact that in the real world, the calendar and timekeeping methods we use here on Earth would, almost without a doubt, totally not work at all for 99.99999% of all the other planets in the universe. Because, surprise, surprise, planets orbit their stars at their own unique speeds, and they rotate on their axes at different rates, too, both of which are influenced by a large number of factors and can range from nearly static to extremely fast.
Just to put it in perspective for you: One ""day"" on Venus, our closest neighbor planet, is equivalent to approximately 117 Earth days because its rotation is so much slower than ours. On the other hand, one ""year"" on Venus is equivalent to 225 Earth days because Venus moves a bit faster, and its orbital path is shorter than Earth's. (The 243 Earth days figure you may see bandied about as the length of a Venusian day is its sidereal day. The mean solar day is shorter due to Venus's retrograde rotation, whereas planets that rotate prograde have a solar day that is longer than the sidereal day.) It gets weirder — one Mercurian day is about 176 Earth days, or precisely two Mercurian years. (The precise 1:2 ratio is due to a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance.) Yes, that's right — on Mercury, a day is two years. (Feel free to speculate about whether dates like April p.m. have any meaning.)
And this is before you take relativity into account: depending on gravity and velocity, time can actually proceed at different rates at different points in the universe.
When this occurs (even more bizarrely) in a Time Travel story, it's San Dimas Time and/or Meanwhile, in the Future....
A Sub-Trope of Standard Time Units. Contrast Two of Your Earth Minutes, the standard Hand Wave to get around this.
Usually falls into the Acceptable Breaks from Reality category, because Most Writers Are Human. Sometimes Hand Waved (or at least assumed by fans) to be a result of whatever makes us hear them in English.

t24933,UnreliableNarrator,"In most narratives, there's an element of trust that the person telling you the story is telling the truth, at least as far as they know it. This trope occurs when that convention is discarded. The narrator's facts contradict each other. If you ask them to go back a bit and retell it, the events come out a little differently. It can be like dealing with a used-car salesman — there's a real story in there somewhere, but you're left to piece it together through all the lies, half-truths, and mistruths.
Reasons for the unreliability vary. Sometimes the narrator is a guilty party and is trying to mislead the audience as well as the other characters. If the narrator is insane, it's Through the Eyes of Madness. A consistent and sincere testimony may prove Unreliable if coming from a perspective of personal bias, or conclusions drawn from incomplete observation. If the narrator has honestly misunderstood what's going on due to naivete, inexperience, or just lack of information, it's Innocent Inaccurate.
As an author, this is a difficult trick to pull off. It is a lot easier to tell a straight story than it is to deliberately mislead the audience, never mind that it violates the traditional assumption that Viewers Are Morons. And there's always a risk of attracting Misaimed Fandom.
One common technique is to use a Framing Device, so that the narrator is presented as a character in the frame story, to emphasize that he is not actually the author. Another, even trickier method, is the Literary Agent Hypothesis, where the narrator is supposedly relating things that happened in Real Life. Multiple unreliable narrators results in ""Rashomon""-Style. If it's a visual medium and the picture contradicts the narration, it's an Unreliable Voiceover. This can also be used as a trick in commercials, to evade claims of false advertising by having an unreliable character do the talking.
First-person stories and third-person-limited stories are candidates for two levels of the Unreliable Narrator. First, a well-written story would have the Innocent Inaccurate version, simply because the narrator shouldn't provide any information that the viewpoint character doesn't have, and in a more-difficult version, may not be able to provide information he has because the character hasn't the vocabulary or the necessary background knowledge. Second, the narrator sometimes refuses to tell us what the viewpoint character knows or sees at a critical junction.
In video games and other interactive works, an unreliable narrator can maintain immersion while dismissing the character losing numerous Video-Game Lives as poor memory or wandering thoughts, or even while drawing attention to uncharacteristic actions or exhaustion of options. This does require more effort on the designers to identify potential plot branches and the consequences of all of the player's possible input at every critical moment.
Unreliable Expositor is a variant with less than credible exposition from specific characters, as opposed to narrators of the whole story. Contrast Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane where the evidence is reliable but insufficient, and Infallible Narrator, when the narration of the character is far more accurate than the character's capabilities.
This can also be a source of humour for the work, too.
Note that this is specifically for narrators within the work. When it's the author that's lying, that's Lying Creator. When the author simply can't make up his mind, that's Flip-Flop of God.
Note: as this is often a particularly subversive Reveal, REALLY BIG spoilers ahead, especially in the Literature section. See also ""Rashomon""-Style, Unreliable Voiceover, and Self-Serving Memory. Fanon tropes like Alternative Character Interpretation result from the fandom treating the narrator as unreliable by default. On the other hand, the narrator may end up being seen as unreliable due to breaking the audience's Willing Suspension of Disbelief, thus leading to tropes like Unintentionally Sympathetic and its converse."
t24977,UnusualEuphemism,"The characters are talking about an embarrassing issue by using a rubber-ducking euphemism that the scriptwriters just made up.
Many Science Fiction shows make up such curse words so as not to offend Standards and Practices, probably because these expressions can pass as Future Slang.
Can sometimes even be the result of censorship: see the Bowdlerization: Film subpage.
Rather than being used to talk about an embarrassing issue, may be used to discuss something of questionable legality without attracting attention. If used to talk about one's personal body parts, the trope is I Call Him ""Mr. Happy"".
Sister trope to Sexual Euphemism. Contrast Unusual Dysphemism. Compare to Smurfing, Never Say ""Die"", Foreign Cuss Word, Pardon My Klingon, Gosh Dang It to Heck!, Curse of the Ancients, Hold Your Hippogriffs, Getting Crap Past the Radar and Informed Obscenity.
A Date with Rosie Palms attracts a lot of them. See also Lampshaded Double Entendre. If a character interprets an innocent phrase as one of these, you have Is That What They're Calling It Now?. Intercourse with You songs and, of course, bawdy ones sometimes have a lot of these."
t25250,ViewersAreGeniuses,"The public's been clamoring for some more intelligent television in the wake of Reality TV and Lowest Common Denominator Recycled Scripts. So, you go and write a series loaded with difficult quantum mechanics, quoting obscure 17th-century philosophers, with characters who are philosophical Magnificent Bastards who speak a dozen languages while conversing to each other by sending Shakespearean Zen koans hidden into chess move patterns, and packed with allusions to ancient Sumerian religion. You make sure all your Techno Babble is scientifically plausible and go to great lengths to make sure all your ancient Roman soldiers are wearing exact replicas of period equipment. Now it's True Art, right?
So you sit back and watch the ratings — which plummet faster than a rocket-propelled brick in a nosedive. What went wrong? In trying to avert making the classic mistake that Viewers Are Morons, you went too far and ended up assuming that they're geniuses instead. Of course, if you're working in a medium that doesn't need an audience of millions to be profitable, you may not care. While a lot less common than its more insulting opposite (any show without the ""mass-market appeal"" that the less high-brow stuff has will be Screwed by the Network without mercy), overestimating the audience can be more of a death knell than underestimating it, even without network sabotage.
The opposite is also true: an intelligent, engaging work may lack any sort of references at all. There's also the trap of being so consumed with the complexities that you forget simpler things like plot and characterization.
However, in the eyes of artists and some fans, this is a Justified Trope. There are many instances where a film with dense references and information provides an Unconventional Learning Experience, introducing high concepts in a dramatic, entertaining fashion. This empowers readers and viewers and makes them interested and curious in exploring offbeat ideas that they otherwise might have felt they are not educated to understand and accept, since many of them have internalized the Viewers Are Morons ideas and reflexively feel some movies or books are not for them. For instance, Joseph Campbell's Heroic Journey concept was fairly obscure before Star Wars used a Heroic Journey plot, which brought the concept into the mainstream. There's also Society Marches On to consider. The number of people with college educations is higher today than it was, say, in The '60s, so what used to be obscure becomes mainstream with the passage of time, and indeed, new genres and new storytelling techniques are created because audiences have become too smart for old plots and hackneyed clichés. In the case of some artists, the dense play of text and subtext for them is the reason why they make art in the first place, and they set out to fill it with Genius Bonuses and Rewatch Bonuses so that audiences can immerse themselves in understanding the work fully.
Ironically, the reverse is also true. Art forms that we regard today as High Art like opera, classical music, poetry, and even Greek or Shakespearean tragedy were popular and commercial work in the day. Audiences across the class and educational spectrum had no trouble understanding and following these works. And indeed, they were all filled with topical and common references that audiences had no trouble following.
It is this distinction which is why you see so much dissonance in understanding humor as a general topic. It is far easier for the Lowest Common Denominator to ""get"" a joke, if there is a clear ""butt"" of the joke. However, people who really follow humor aren't aiming to disparage people, but are instead in finding out the Twist Ending, or the Pun.
The most successful way to do this may be to provide a Genius Bonus. If a writer gives the more intellectual content a small dose at a time, viewers can still enjoy the work at their level, but those who get the Easter Egg will enjoy its hidden depths.
See also Faux Symbolism, Mind Screw, and Moon Logic Puzzle. Not mutually exclusive with Critical Research Failure - just because a show is crammed with obscure knowledge doesn't mean that it is correct, even when it comes from the show to begin with. This can be the result of too many In Jokes being included in a work.
See also Viewers Are Morons, the opposite side of the coin. When this trope and the latter trope conflict however, you can wind up with an Unpleasable Fanbase."
t25284,VillainousBreakdown,"The tendency of relatively calm and composed villains to lose their cool over the course of the story. Usually happens to arrogant Chessmaster-type villains (especially if said villain is a Smug Snake), as control of the situation slips from his or her grasp and things come up that they Didn't See Coming. Most notable when it happens towards the end of the story to show how pathetic the Big Bad is when things are not going exactly as planned (""This Cannot Be!""). Especially apparent if they previously had Creepy Monotone or Dissonant Serenity, and suddenly start Chewing the Scenery (when they do this because their plan is succeeding, it's more of a case of Drunk on the Dark Side). Dirty Cowards also suffer from this, especially when they are cornered.
Similar to Oh, Crap!, though the difference lies in that Oh, Crap! moments involve a single moment where the character finds that they are screwed, while Villainous Breakdowns have them see it coming from miles away. The good-guy counterpart is the Heroic Safe Mode.
Note that this isn't necessarily an example of Villain Decay. On the contrary, some villains become much more terrifying and dangerous when their façade of cunning and civility crumbles. They might even end up dishing out a vicious No-Holds-Barred Beatdown to the Hero(es), engage in some Cold-Blooded Torture or, goodness forbid, drop the Villain Ball and Just FINISH HIM Already instead of playing around. It could even lead them to stop holding back their true nature and assuming their true form as the Complete Monster they actually were. Thus, a Villainous Breakdown is frequently a trigger for a One-Winged Angel transformation. Affably Evil and Faux Affably Evil villains are prone to becoming far more terrifying and disturbing when they undergo one of these because their fairly normal personality serve to emphasize their breakdown.
A somewhat less common, but not exactly infrequent, form of breakdown results in the exact opposite reaction: the villain lapses into a catatonic state as the shock of their defeat robs them of their wits. Another form of breakdown occurs due to Heel Realization causing a Villainous BSoD. Yet another is the impotent flailing of a defeated villain, left with nothing without power.
The scale of the breakdown generally depends on the nature — and overall impressiveness — of the villain. A Smug Snake, being generally inclined to rate their own abilities higher than everyone around them anyway and less equipped to deal with setbacks, will usually break down more frequently and over relatively minor spanners in the works, with the resulting tantrum usually being less-than-impressive. A Magnificent Bastard, on the other hand, is already the type of villain who's not inclined to sweat the small stuff, and will usually respond to most setbacks fairly calmly; however, this merely means that if their plans suffer a particularly impressive implosion, then this will usually make their resulting breakdown all the more epic. Similarly, a relatively minor or small-scale villain may have a breakdown on the level of a temper tantrum or explosive Cluster F-Bomb rant; a major or larger scale villain, however, will frequently have a breakdown with potentially (and quite literally) world-ending consequences. As the old saying goes, ""The bigger you are, the harder you fall"".
In another type, the breakdown won't be one, sudden explosion, but a gradual progression of smaller, gradually increasing breakdowns happening over the course of the story. As their Evil Plan comes closer to failing or their plans fail again and again, they simply get worse and worse as the breakdown continues, until finally, they lose it completely. This normally happens in the buildup to the final confrontation. This can overlap with Sanity Slippage, where a character gradually becomes more and more insane as time goes on. And as a special treat, when the villain finally goes so crazy and bat-shit insane that he completely loses it, other characters tend to hit him with a You're Insane!.
Another type of breakdown is when the villain becomes extremely furious when either something happens that isn't part of his plan or his plans end up being ruined, or both. Once pissed off, they may lose their temper and say such phrases as ""Why Won't You Die?"", ""I've had it with you!"", ""You Monster!"", or even ""This Is Unforgivable!"". Either way, the villain will scream more and more at the other characters in fury before being bested by them. A string of Kick the Dog or Bad Boss moments is another subtle way of indicating this, if the villain had previously displayed parent-like feelings toward their henchmen.
One specific variation appears in some Video Games where the main villain is able to broadcast messages to the player over the course of the story, and they eventually lose it and start broadcasting more and more desperate pleas/insults/bribes to the player as they get closer to them.
For Anti Villains, or ones with a Freudian Excuse, a breakdown can either play Cry for the Devil (if their breakdown is pathetic) or cement them on the far side of the Moral Event Horizon (if they went Jumping Off the Slippery Slope during their breakdown). A subversion of this trope is Graceful Loser.
Heroes have been known to suffer similar breakdowns, though (unless they are making a Last Stand) they are much less likely to die during one.
Note that this is usually done in a climax and just the fact that one occurs is a pretty big spoiler, so read with caution.
Super-Trope to Villainous BSoD.
Sister Trope to Rage Breaking Point (and can often overlap).
Not to confuse with Broken Heel, which is a literal application of the term."
t25309,VillainProtagonist,"An interesting twist on conventional storytelling is to make The Protagonist a villain. Sometimes (but not always), this villainous main character will even get the Sympathetic P.O.V.. On the other hand, it is not necessary for a villain to be sympathetic for them to be this trope. They simply need to be a villain whose morally reprehensible actions (however well-intentioned) are in no way glossed over or justified within the context of the story. We are seeing the story from a villain's point of view.
A Villain Protagonist (especially in a comedy) is quite likely to go down in flames at the end. Whether this counts as a Downer Ending or not generally depends on how many dogs they kick along the way and/or how entertaining their Humiliation Conga or Karmic Death is. They may also do a Heel–Face Turn and become a Hero Protagonist. This doesn't necessarily mean they will lose or perform a Heel–Face Turn. In fact, their status as a main character just makes it more likely that the story will end with the villain winning than any other story would.
When this is done for one episode, it's a Villain Episode.
This trope very often overlaps with a Nominal Hero and/or Sociopathic Hero, and sometimes with the more extreme cases of an Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist. Note that they do not necessarily have to be the Big Bad- a Villain Protagonist can, and often does, deal with cases where they are the victim of some other villain rather than the aggressor and try to survive like anyone else would, but in order to be considered a Sociopathic Hero or a Heroic Comedic Sociopath as well, their struggle has to protect other victims of their enemy; it doesn't matter if they care at all about them or if any good that comes out of it is purely coincidental. Actually, authors may find that it is easier to write a story where the antagonist makes the plot rather than the villain, which means that a villainous protagonist is often just as passive and reactive to other characters acts as a more traditional heroic protagonist. In fact, it is rather rare for a Villain Protagonist to be the villain of a story, presumably because audiences still want to root for the protagonist. It can still easily result in Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy if handled poorly, or if the Protagonist is too Villainous. If this is a comedy, where empathy isn't important however, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.
Very often leads to Misaimed Fandom. Do not confuse with the Anti-Hero, who lacks traditional heroic qualities and may have some unheroic ones, and may be more morally ambiguous, but is still ultimately on the side of good (although an Anti-Hero can end up becoming a Villain Protagonist if they end up crossing one too many lines. Also not to be confused with Byronic Hero, who is simply a deeply flawed person, heroic or not. Many Byronic Heroes tend to zone in and out of Villain Protagonist territory, though. If the main character is the villain to themselves in their own story, they are His Own Worst Enemy. If a heroic protagonist is revealed to be Evil All Along towards the end, this is The Killer in Me.
Contrast Hero Antagonist, both in terms of morality and role in the story. Compare and contrast Villain Antagonist and Hero Protagonist. Do not mix up with Vanilla Protagonist."
t25325,VillainWithGoodPublicity,"A Villain with Good Publicity is one of the most frustrating opponents a hero can ever face. On the surface, this villain works within the system and commands a great deal of respect from the average citizen, but behind the scenes, conducts all manners of nastiness. Even the heroes (or the audience!) may be fooled until The Reveal, unaware that The Man Behind the Man is someone so publicly trusted.
Should the heroes know the truth, they're still stymied by the fact that no one else does. Attempts to bust the villain will be met with harassment lawsuits, breaking  entering or assault charges, or bad press. The heroes may even be falsely painted as villains in the public eye. (Some heroes embrace this image and become the Lovable Rogue or the Anti-Hero.) Should the heroes turn up actual evidence that something is up, it'll probably be ripped up by the villain's crack legal team (which Villains With Good Publicity always have), or spun to look like honest behavior.
The Villain With Good Publicity is very good at getting the hero (or other innocents who get too close to the truth) accused of criminal activity. Then again, heroics are 90% based on breaking and entering, stalking, trespassing, assault, battery, and espionage anyway, so they may have a point there.
Worthy Opponents, Enigmatic Minions, Punch Clock Villains and other types of sympathetic antagonists often find themselves working for the well-liked villain, unaware what their boss is really up to.
In an episodic series, a Villain With Good Publicity is a good way to preserve the status quo; the best the hero can hope to do is foil a particular plot, not bust the actual villain. Although not always legally invincible, often the only way to defeat this foe permanently is to kill them. Heroes in this situation will frequently try to Trash Talk the villain, or tell them they won't get away with it.
If the heroes are really unlucky, they're up against the entire government (or church, depending on the setting). The villain might also be a single person within the government, a corporation head or other public figure with a good PR department, or a religion engineered for this purpose. There's also a good chance that the villain is using copious amounts of bribery to keep their image clean. If things get even worse, the people whom the hero tries to protect will actively assist the villain against the heroes.
This villain's favored weapon is the Propaganda Machine. Or Bread and Circuses.
This villain may be portrayed as a hero (or the hero), and may even think of themself as the hero. Their villainous acts might even be portrayed as heroic. Alternative Character Interpretation may lead to viewing a story's hero as a Villain With Good Publicity.
If you need to take down a Villain With Good Publicity, send in a Cowboy Cop, Knight In Sour Armor, or anyone else who's prepared to play dirty for the greater good — or perhaps organize an Engineered Public Confession to out them as a Straw Hypocrite. The Ideal Hero and other idealistic heroes, by contrast, have no idea how to deal with these guys. Either way, any hero attempting to take one of these guys on can end up as a Hero with Bad Publicity. A Guile Hero might have some luck setting up an Involuntary Charity Donation to deprive the villain of assets while being unable to retaliate without compromising their good publicity.
Compare with Falsely Reformed Villain, where a villain puts on short-term pretense of reform. Contrast with most Evil Overlords and Card Carrying Villains who make no attempt to hide their villainy, and the Ancient Conspiracy, which hides its entire existence. The exact opposite is a villain who has a 0% Approval Rating, and a more extreme version is the Devil in Plain Sight (whom no one cares about one way or the other). Can be a form of No Hero to His Valet.
In some settings, the villain may actually have a plausible case for being considered a (sorta) good guy. If so, expect the setting to lean towards the ""cynical"" end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism. May use Too Funny to Be Evil as an affable PR tactic. Villains who win over the fans are Rooting for the Empire or Draco in Leather Pants.
This trope is much more common in real life than Card-Carrying Villainy. However, as an ""Evil Trope"", examples would quickly devolve into complaining, so No Real Life Examples, Please!."
t25421,VoluntaryShapeshifting,"A character with the power to transform and reshape his or her body. This trope comes in a wide variety of forms, but can be classified by exactly what the character can transform themselves into.
Most commonly, a character is limited to a specific set of one or more ""alternate"" forms, or a specific ""class"" of things he can change into (animals, machines, elements, etc.) Sometimes, there's a specific feature that they are unable to conceal, like hair color or voice, that others can use to identify them regardless of what form they are in. If the only thing they are able to change is hair/eye color, they have Kaleidoscope Hair / Eyes.
Usually, the character can transform simply by thinking about it, but occasionally they may use a gadget or a magic phrase.
Magic Pants are almost always in effect, unless the shapeshifting character demonstrates or mentions they are simply molding what looks like clothing out of his/her body cells for the common decency of those around them. (In which case, it's best not to think too much about that... whoops, too late.)
Many Superheroes have this power, along with nearly all gods and Sufficiently Advanced Aliens. It's particularly popular with Tricksters and Reality Warpers.
Many with a flexible transformation scheme also have a tacked-on bonus ability to alter their shape in any way they wish; i.e., adopt a clay-like consistency and sculpt themselves blob-style. The stretchy, ultraflexible body of a character like Plastic Man or Mrs. Incredible is a milder form. Others may use a Partial Transformation to ""mix and match"" elements of their human and transformed states.
Being able to form limbs into stabbing weapons and reform oneself after being blown apart by explosives has become an almost standard ability of the clay-consistency metamorph in recent years, probably due to the popularity of the T-1000 character from Terminator 2: Judgment Day.
Quite a few Shifters boast Elemental Powers, with water-based powers being particularly popular. A potent Healing Factor is also often packaged in, considering they can restructure their body at will.
Exactly where their extra body mass comes from (or goes) when a shapeshifter transforms from one size to another is known as Shapeshifter Baggage.
Can be used for Narrative Shapeshifting. The Shapeshifting Seducer finds picking up partners at bars is fairly easy.
Sooner or later, a Phlebotinum Breakdown may leave the character suffering Involuntary Shapeshifting or Shapeshifter Mode Lock, if only temporarily. If badly beaten or near death, they may have a Superpower Meltdown and lose control of their power, resulting in a Shapeshifter Swan Song. If the character isn't very used to morphing shapes they may have Limb-Sensation Fascination after each change. Such a character might also be Otherworldly and Sexually Ambiguous."
t25547,WarIsHell,"War! Hunh! Good God, y'all! What is it good for? Absolutely nuthin'! Truth in Television, obviously.
When this theme is in play, war is an infernal, nasty, traumatizing nightmare, and anyone who comes out of it alive will end up a Shell-Shocked Veteran. Those who take pleasure in it are Ax-Crazy Blood Knights or worse. This trope gained its name by the famous quote from General William T. Sherman, ""War is all Hell, and I have every intent of making it so."" Most people quoting it shorten it to the trope name (as Sherman himself did in the page quote).
The motivations for war are depicted as harking back to humanity's basest and most savage instincts: pride, greed, important resources, dogma, fear, disgust, hatred, retribution, power, insanity, megalomania, or even all of the above. The brutal and callous force of wartime authority overrides all individual thought.
Sometimes, the war is shown to be unwinnable regardless of the sacrifices made and moral codes abandoned. There is some correlation between being on the losing side of a war and making a work following this trope.
War Is Hell works often show the cumulative long-term effect of exposure to pain, deprivation, violence, and military culture: the horror goes on and on, dehumanizing everybody a little more each night. Heroes in these stories will typically struggle to Prevent the War, or end it as bloodlessly and quickly as possible. If not, then merely surviving physically, and with most of their humanity and sanity intact.
May overlap with, but not to be confused with, Hell Is War. Contrast War Is Glorious, which is not mutually exclusive with this tropenote sometimes, War Is Hell can be seen as a Deconstructed Trope of War Is Glorious, especially when the audience gets a kick out of seeing people kill each other, no matter how ugly or condemning the work is — or, more altruistically, when soldiers are painted as heroes specifically because they've volunteered to fight in order to keep the horrors of war away from their loved ones. See also Armies Are Evil (highly negative takes on the military).
Of course, war is traumatizing to many who experience this trope. Therefore, Real Life examples are redundant."
t25756,WellDoneSonGuy,"Our hero may be a perfectly Nice Guy, respectable, successful, a loving husband and a good father. But what he really wants is for this one guy to acknowledge this.
Most often, that one guy is his emotionally distant father, though it can also be The Ace, The Mentor, an Aloof Big Brother or especially that Always Someone Better individual, usually as an old friend of the hero. Almost always a Special Guest, and often a Large Ham as well. When it's a recurring character, usually a controlling parent.
A ""Fawlty Towers"" Plot will often ensue as our hero tries increasingly more convoluted schemes to convince the ""Well Done, Son!"" Guy of his worth.
In the end, one of two things happens. Rarely, the ""Well Done, Son!"" Guy will turn out to have some kind of massive character flaw, and our hero will realize that it's been a mistake to weight his opinion so highly. This may result in the betrayed hero Calling the Old Man Out. Most of the time, though, everything comes to a head when the ""Well Done, Son!"" Guy finally asks the hero why he's gone to such ridiculous ends. The hero fesses up, and the ""Well Done, Son!"" Guy explains that he's respected the hero all along, and assumed the hero already knew. If the ""Well Done, Son!"" Guy is the hero's friend instead of his father, he'll often also explain that he'd always desperately wanted the respect of the hero as well (hell, sometimes the father wanted the kid's respect, especially if there's something big and nasty in his past, probably either ignored by or unknown to the hero).
Cue the Sentimental Music Cue.
In other genres, this can be a bit more understated, with the ""Well Done, Son!"" Guy simply giving our hero an approving nod from a distance (or saying, ""That'll do, pig""). If the ""Well Done, Son!"" Guy is a Trickster Mentor or Zen Survivor, they may have a very long and painful road ahead of them to get even that. May be part of an Inadequate Inheritor plot. The Fantasy-Forbidding Father usually inspires this sort of feeling. This dynamic is usually father-son. Mother-daughter and father-daughter are not too unusual, but mother-son is rare (unless it's the Jewish Mother scenario, which is almost always Played for Laughs).
A really unpleasant variation is when the ""Well Done, Son!"" Guy is already dead, which in most cases means the approval and emotional bonding will never happen. At best, the character may gain some comfort by following his understanding of what the deceased would want if he were alive.
Contrast So Proud of You. Also see ""Well Done, Dad!"" Guy, which is the inversion of this trope. This may be caused by Anti-Nepotism."
t25758,WellIntentionedExtremist,"A villain who has an overall goal which the heroes can appreciate in principle, but whose methods of pursuing said goal (such as mass murder) are problematic; despite any sympathy they may have with their cause, the heroes have no choice but to stop them. Taken to extremes, they may fully believe that Utopia Justifies the Means. Such an idealistic extremist is likely to be either a Totalitarian Utilitarian or a Principles Zealot, depending on whether they’re aiming For Happiness or For Great Justice. The most well-written examples of this trope are the kind that the reader/viewer stops just short of agreeing with.
Other times, the villain may be out for simple revenge against a person or corporation or other entity that has undeniably wronged them. Again, the heroes may sympathize with their plight, but are obliged to stop them because they care not who gets in the way of their planned revenge. However, the heroes will often investigate the villain's grievance themselves and will complement stopping the villain with taking down the offending party as well.
Maybe they started out with actions as good as their intentions, but were forced to take more extreme measures. Either way, it's a common end result of Jumping Off the Slippery Slope. Their favorite phrase is I Did What I Had to Do.
There are four basic flavors of Well Intentioned Extremist:
On the extreme end, may result in the even darker Knight Templar who chooses to either remove free will, believing it the best way to save the world or destroy whoever they don’t consider worthy enough to live. Unlike this, The Well-Intentioned Extremist isn't a punisher of all flaws or a dictator who argues that they are good and therefore everyone else is bad; they actually realise that some of their victims don't deserve to die or suffer, but insist that it is for the greater good and actually isn't entirely wrong. They could also be a fallen Wide-Eyed Idealist that was driven over the edge, and sometimes a Worthy Opponent or even Reluctant Warrior. Vigilante Man is a case where the Well-Intentioned Extremist hasn't (yet) descended to the point of not caring who gets hurt. Often ends up in rivalries with the Knight In Sour Armor. Maybe they're Obliviously Evil and don't realise they're the bad guy, in which case they're prone to My God, What Have I Done? and becoming wracked with guilt and horror if they're ever enlightened. Some of those seeking to bring about a One World Order to end international strife may count as this.
This can be a difficult line to walk: push too hard in one direction and you make it seem as if the extreme methods are acceptable; push too hard in the other and you run the risk of denying the validity of their initial cause, of arguing for oppression (for instance) instead of against it. When the balancing is done they more often than not tend to be either Anti-Villains or even dark Anti-Heroes, especially if put more emphasis on the ""well-intentioned"" part than the ""extremist"" one. However, there are some who seem like WIEs but in reality are just straight-up villains, particularly if they are the other way around in terms of what they put more emphasis on and if they are obviously just using their philosophy as a shallow excuse to commit evil. Another version of a darker villain being this trope is that they have an actual philosophy which they believe will ""improve"" the world but the philosophy itself is too obviously evil to garner any sympathy, such as is often the case with the Misanthrope Supreme and genocidal maniacs.
Often, these characters are presented as more dangerous and terrifying than some who are straight-up For the Evulz and Take Over the World types and with good reason: Even Evil Has Standards does not usually apply to them, as it might be for some others. After all, if you think you're doing the right thing, then it's easy to consider even the most horrific actions an acceptable compromise.
Compare with Necessarily Evil, where the villain in question has a Heel Realization and recognizes that he deserves punishment (of course, he may always choose to just Ignore That Epiphany). See also A Lighter Shade of Grey. A staple trope of the Master Computer gone mad. If the positive intention is overthrowing an evil government, the Well Intentioned Extremists will be an example of The Revolution Will Not Be Civilized. If the positive intention is helping a friend- realizing things that said friend sees as immoral- the Well Intentioned Extremist will be an example of Poisonous Friend. If his extremism actually succeeds in making the world a better place, it's The Extremist Was Right. The Small Steps Hero desperately wants to avert this trope. The Not-So-Well-Intentioned Extremist has no such convictions.
As this trope often goes hand-in-hand with the Face–Heel Turn or may involve the reveal of a villain's true plans (or intentions), expect spoilers."
t25817,WhamEpisode,"The point in a series where the story takes a sudden dramatic turn. Things will never be quite the same again.
When advertisements tease you with words such as ""The most shocking episode of the season!"", they're probably referring to this (unless they're not). This is the episode meant to radically alter the status quo, and in doing so send a major shock through the viewership.
Note that it's not a Wham Episode if it turns out that the shocking events were All Just a Dream, or if the changes are reversed with a Snap Back or Reset Button, or if the series has Negative Continuity. To count as a Wham Episode, the events must actually happen and become canon. When a series is already successful, and the writers decide to do this, it's very risky. The writers are making a bold move and risking losing a lot of their fans. The writers have balls. You might even say they have canon balls.
Almost always takes place at a Season Finale, and at times can even be a Grand Finale if it includes a high enough shock factor (which isn't always the case). Alternatively, it might come before the Season Finale, which then resolves the plot twist.
It's not always done well, of course. Particularly poorly-done wham episodes almost invariably result in a Shocking Swerve.
Compare Genre Turning Point and Nothing Is the Same Anymore. Contrast with Breather Episode. Related to Drama Bomb. Complete opposite of Status Quo Is God. If this is the first episode and/or the prologue, it's a Downer Beginning. If the WHAM aspect is concentrated in a single line, it's a Wham Line. See also Ascended Fridge Horror, wherein some aspects of the series leave some viewers with reason to expect a tone shift, before they see it applied by the writers. Often the first warning that the viewer is dealing with a Deconstruction. Frequently caused by or contains a Gut Punch.
It also has nothing to do with a certain British 80s pop band with George Michael, or a JoJo villain named after said band.
Because real life is not scripted, do not add such examples.
Here be unmarked spoilers. Proceed at your own risk."
t25818,WhamLine,"Whereas a Wham Episode is an episode that radically alters the Story Arc, a Wham Line is a line of dialogue that radically alters a scene.
A scene is headed in one direction, then the line is uttered. Afterwards, the scene is going somewhere very, very different. For it to be effective the audience must not see it coming — not just not knowing the exact information, but not expecting any kind of surprising, or even significant, line there at all. If there was background music playing beforehand, expect it to abruptly come to a stop after the line is said.
This is strictly an audience trope. For a milder in-universe version, see Dropping the Bombshell. Often overlaps with Armor-Piercing Question or Armor-Piercing Response, where the line causes a character to seriously rethink their position. In a joke or comic story, a Punch Line functions very similarly.
When something seen by the viewer or reader of visual media radically alters a scene, it's a Wham Shot.
Tends to come in the form of a reveal. Can fit into a Wham Episode.
By the very nature of the trope, SPOILERS AHEAD. If we marked them all, the subpages would be 60% white space. Please don't use spoiler markup when adding examples.
Note: This is not just a line that happens during a Wham Episode. The line itself has to radically change the plot in itself. If the line is the result of events or conversations that are clearly shown on screen, or it's a Foregone Conclusion, then it is not a Wham Line. The line itself has to be completely unexpected."
t25848,WhatHappenedToTheMouse,"""What happened to the mouse?"" occurs when a minor character, action, or very minor plotline is suddenly dropped from the story for no apparent reason, without any real explanation about what happened to it, and without a resolution.
There are several main reasons this happens: in movies, the most common is that scenes are excised in editing, but references to them still remain elsewhere in the film. Another common reason is that a Wrong Genre Savvy audience mistakenly attached too much importance to what always was intended to be a throwaway. A third is that The Law of Conservation of Detail was not properly applied: a Bit Character was a little too lively, so that he didn't appear a throw-away, as why was that much detail given for one?
If the element comes back just as you've forgotten about it, this is actually a Brick Joke or a Chekhov's Gun. If the element doesn't come back, but the show hangs a lampshade on it at the end, then it's Something We Forgot. If it escapes your notice until after the show is over and you've gotten up to go to the fridge to make a sandwich, it's Fridge Logic.
Alternately, if it's a character that's disappeared, it's a variation on the ""What Now?"" Ending; not only are we unclear what happens to the character, but this also can leave doubts as to whether they even survived once they broke away from the other characters.
Another character or the Narrator may remark that they were never heard from again.
The trope's name refers to a scene in The Last Emperor in which the title character violently throws his beloved pet mouse offscreen. There's no sound of the mouse hitting anything, but it's never seen again, leaving its fate ambiguous... in the theatrical cut, anyway.
What Happened to the Mouse moments can be very rich soil for Epileptic Trees or Wild Mass Guessing.
Not to be confused with Aborted Arc, which is when a major story arc or plotline is dropped without resolution, or Chuck Cunningham Syndrome, where a major character just plain disappears.
A What Happened To The Mouse that is deliberately created and where the creators have no intention of ever resolving the question is a Noodle Incident. A What Happened To The Mouse that is returned to as a Brick Joke is Something We Forgot.
Often the result of a Wacky Wayside Tribe, a Forgotten Fallen Friend, a One-Scene Wonder, or a Big-Lipped Alligator Moment.
Compare with Left Hanging, Uncertain Doom, Kudzu Plot, Red Herring Twist, Out of Focus, Put on a Bus. Related tropes include Never Found the Body and ""What Now?"" Ending. May involve a Shrug of God. See also Offscreen Inertia if you imagine the plot line still stuck at that spot for eternity. Could lead to an Esoteric Happy Ending at worst if the plot thread was a major one that wasn't resolved."
t25880,WhatTheHellHero,"When characters In-Universe call out one of the heroes for doing something clearly unheroic, if not outright heinous.
Occasionally, an author will drop some gray into his otherwise flawlessly good guy hero... and have others, particularly The Heart (and especially The McCoy), notice. This can add guilt and remorse to a character as they feel shame for their evil actions, and legitimately have to fight to restore their name, undo the harm, or simply live with the guilt and shame of it. In this case, you can expect to hear some variation of ""Haven't you done enough already?"" More extremely, it can be the first step towards Anti-Hero-dom or a full-blown Face–Heel Turn. A Redemption Quest is usually considered the most noble or morally good way to respond to this.
It shows the fans that the author knows their hero did wrong, thereby averting Moral Dissonance.
The opposite of Protagonist-Centered Morality; contrast also Designated Hero and Hero Insurance. See also What Is Evil? and Not So Different for when a villain is the one pointing this out, or acting as though there's something to point out to mess with the hero. (A variation is when the villain will praise the hero, which the hero will find profoundly humiliating.)
If the player is given no choice in their decision due to Railroading or multiple choices they can make all end with terrible consequences, and the player is then called out for their actions, they are Blamed For Being Railroaded.
Almost never applies to those Powers That Be who have an Omniscient Morality License, although characters who Rage Against the Heavens might attempt it. Likewise, villains tend to be immune to this thanks to their It's All About Me attitude (or, at best, Moral Myopia), though a Heel Realisation might clue them in, perhaps leading to a Villainous BSoD. (This trope doesn't really apply to villains who are just doing it For the Evulz.) Those pesky Trickster Mentors may also find themselves on the receiving end of Rage Against the Mentor.
Some video games offer dialogue trees or something similar that might allow your character to call someone out for their horrible behavior, which can be immensely satisfying. If your character is the one being called out, it's What the Hell, Player? My God, What Have I Done? may be a self-inflicted version. Can come right off the heels of a Sadistic Choice foisted on the player in a video game. The hero may attempt to invoke I Did What I Had to Do as his justification, though this does not always succeed. Of course, those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, and one should beware of his own Moral Myopia leading to The Complainer Is Always Wrong. Results may vary against the Sociopathic Hero or The Unfettered; beware you don't get a Shut Up, Kirk! or Hannibal Lecture in response. Et Tu, Brute? may also counts as this when a hero does not make a full Face–Heel Turn, but gets called out for nearly betraying his allies. If it's a child calling out a parent, it's Calling the Old Man Out. Can somewhat overlap with ""The Reason You Suck"" Speech if a character points out a hero's flaws in very long detail in the most brutal way possible. A character verbally chastising the hero may realize s/he Was Too Hard on Him if s/he feels uncomfortable in chewing out the hero. The hero may lash out at the reproof if he Can't Take Criticism.
Of course, the critics aren't necessarily infallible themselves. There may be times when those making the criticism may not be aware of extenuating factors for the heroes. Sometimes, those making a What The Hell Hero statement can get one in return- an Anti-Hero may call The Hero out on being too inflexible to do what is necessary, while the hero may respond that his critic's methods are little better than those of the villains.
Important note: This article is exclusively about scenes where the hero is called on his morally ambiguous or directly evil actions by characters in the story. If the Designated Hero is a Jerkass (or worse), but no one calls him on it in the series, then take your example to Moral Dissonance or Designated Hero. Good-intended mistakes fall under Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!. Reviewers can call out the Moral Dissonance in their reviews, but they themselves are not engaging in What the Hell, Hero? as they are not part of the series being criticized. A skit still has to be based on events in the series; not something they make up so they can do the criticizing themselves."
t26021,WickedCultured,"It's not that Evil Is Cool. Rather, this is more like ""Evil is Intellectual"". Evil is smart, wicked, sarcastic with a biting sense of humor. Evil is smooth and eloquent, if not outright suave. Evil dresses well, has a polysyllabic lexicon, quotes William Shakespeare, sips fine wine, listens to his favorite opera on his downtime (almost always Don Giovanni), and in general is shown to be cultured if not necessarily civilized. This can apply to any villain, Anti-Villain, or associated character types.
May overlap with Dumb Is Good, but it doesn't have to. The hero of the story can easily be a more rugged intellectual, or he reads/writes poetry, which is almost never perceived as an ""evil"" form of culture (cf. the Warrior Poet trope). Closely related to the Magnificent Bastard, whose sheer tactical and strategic brilliance often sets him inside the trappings of Wicked Cultured (particularly when he catches you and then explains which strategic genius first invented that trap). Faux Affably Evil is a similar overlap of highbrow manners and vicious actions. Villains who try to be this and fail are Wicked Pretentious.
When Aristocrats Are Evil, they almost always follow this trope; when enough of them do, you get Deadly Decadent Court. They are likely to practice Brains and Bondage without any trace of Safe, Sane, and Consensual.
This trope carries Slobs vs. Snobs: people who enjoy pop culture are average joes and probably the protagonists, but those who like ""high"" culture are a bit weird, ""other"", and more likely to be antagonists. There's also significant overlap with Dumb Is Good.
Compare the less sinister Villains Out Shopping, Villainous Fashion Sense, and Man of Wealth and Taste. The exact opposite of this is a Gentleman and a Scholar (unless he is Affably Evil). Someone who keeps trying to be this but whose plans end up less clear, simple, and effective may have a Complexity Addiction.
Not to be confused with Sophisticated as Hell, although overlap is possible."
t26024,WickedStepmother,"The Wicked Stepmother, the woman hostile to her stepchildren, is a perennial trope. Older Than Feudalism, she appears constantly in legends and folklore around the world, and is the villain of many a Fairy Tale.
Psychologists hypothesize that she is an Archetypal Character, devised by children to contain all they hate in their mothers so they can continue to regard Mother as perfect. Some historians, meanwhile, believe that the trope has didactic roots, and that it was developed as a way of warning children against potentially untrustworthy suitors that might try to court their widowed parents for their wealth or their nobility; indeed, Death by Childbirth was extremely common in the Middle Ages, leading to many children of the period being raised by stepmothers.
Sadly enough, Truth in Television; children are vastly more likely to be abused by stepparents. In fact, in some languages, the word for ""stepmother"" is the word for ""mother"" followed by a pejorative suffix.note In Spanish madrastra — the Latin suffix is the same as in ""poetaster,"" a hack poet; in French, the cognate marâtre is now so associated with this trope that it's only used for wicked ones, with the common word being belle-mère, same as ""mother-in-law."" Even centuries of subversion have not transformed her even into a Discredited Trope; she can still be played either straight or subverted.
She generally favors her own children — whether from a previous marriage or this one — over her stepchildren. Not that that causes this trope, because it's kind of natural. It's just another symptom. Sometimes her economic motives are made clear: there is only so much to go around, and she wants it for herself or her own children. An equivalent male figure is the Evil Uncle — because inheritance is generally through the male line, the uncle can inherit his brother's children's estate. Envy is another common cause; the Wicked Stepmother either wants to be Fairest of Them All or to have her daughters be so.
On the other hand, the stepsiblings or halfsiblings can but need not be hostile to the hero(ine). If they are hostile, Youngest Child Wins is trumped by the older child's stepchild status.
The father is seldom a factor. If not dead (which is common), he will nevertheless never intervene on his child's behalf.
Her tactics vary widely. She may simply oppress the heroine, keeping her in rags and slaving at household work — sometimes going as far as assigning the Impossible Task. As a Wicked Witch, she may transform the child(ren) into animals. She may drive or send them off. She may act violently toward them and even kill them (and perhaps cap that by cooking them up and serving them to their father.)
The stepchild(ren) may succeed in defeating her through help from their real though dead mother — the Grimms' version of ""Cinderella"", ""Aschenputtel"", has Aschenputtel get her gowns from the tree planted on her mother's grave. Talking Animals may also feature, as can a Fairy Godmother. These figures can do everything from performing the Impossible Task on behalf of the child to ensuring that She Cleans Up Nicely despite the dirt and rags she is reduced to.
This trope is sometimes the result of writers attempting to Bowdlerise fairy tales by transforming a cruel mother into a wicked stepmother. For instance, Grimms' original tales of ""Snow White"" and ""Hansel and Gretel"" both featured a cruel mother.
Given her status as a villain, the Wicked Stepmother's chances of surviving the ending are not good. The Happily Ever After ending of most fairy tales often dwells with more detail on how the Wicked Stepmother and/or her children were punished than on the hero and happiness. On the other hand, stepmothers who are not disposed of often return; when she is not executed at the wedding, she may, for instance, try to kill the heroine when she gives birth and replace her with her own daughter; so the Fairy Tale doesn't end (happily or not) until she's dead.
Sometimes preceded by a Guess Who I'm Marrying? scenario. Can involve a Missing Mom; older stories usually do, often caused by Death by Childbirth.
A common subversion is the jealous Daddy's Girl regarding any stepmother as a Wicked Stepmother; see Parent with New Paramour for cases where it's the children who are in the wrong.
The Red-Headed Stepchild is a particular victim.
Subtrope of Evil Matriarch. Note that the Magical Nanny often becomes a stepmother, but never a wicked one. Department of Child Disservices is a modern organized variation. Usually, Social Services Does Not Exist in stories with a Wicked Stepmother. Contrast Good Stepmother for the trope's logical antithesis."
t26182,WonTheWarLostThePeace,"So, you won a war, you bask in the glory of victory, and all that stuff. But when you finally get over all this excitement, you realize your problems still aren't solved; perhaps you bungled the end-game negotiations, your enemies are still strong, or your strategic genius doesn't extend to politics. In any case, your enemy has already regrouped and is ready for another turn, like nothing happened. Yeah, that's it. You won, but you totally botched the peace talks, or didn't care to finish off what you've begun.
A close relative of Pyrrhic Victory; the difference is in that Pyrrhic Victory is a victory achieved through an exertion a bit too big to bear, while what we think of here is a victory that is squandered.
If you wish to add examples from Real Life, try to keep it as straight as you can, as otherwise there'd be way too many of them. Also, you know the trade."
t26216,WorkingClassHero,"When a character or group of characters is shown to be highly intelligent and capable precisely because he didn't do fancy things like go to school or study or stuff, that makes him cool. They did everything on the job. As a result, he has all this great timeless common folk wisdom that solves every problem.
This character, at times, tends to be disdainful and negative to characters who learn things through books and/or display conscious and unconscious elitist assumptions about class and society. In other places, for instance communist nations, a Working Class Hero reads books, learns about ideas, and generally isn't anti-intellectual — this character type is more common in socialist and communist literature, which usually works specifically to avert Working Class People Are Morons. Likewise, this character type, for a variety of reasons, tends to be male. Poor women when represented are usually wives, sisters or mothers of the male hero, and their issues are usually seen in gendered dimensions rather than class ones — such as being a struggling single mother, a Single Mom Stripper or in some cases working as prostitutes, in spite of the fact, that at least since The '80s, women represent a disproportionate number of the world's low-income earning population and were victims of some of the worst workplace disasters. Nonetheless, female examples of this trope have become increasingly popular in some media.
Historically, in the vast majority of literature and theater, the heroes and heroines tend to be from aristocratic families while middle-class and working-class family problems are confined to comedies. For a long time, critics and artists regarded aristocratic issues such as fall of a ruling family of high seriousness because it was united with the problems of state as it existed then. Also, realistically speaking, they had better career opportunities to be captains, commanders, soldiers and heroes, so artists should not be faulted for reflecting the confined and restricted worldview as it existed then. And in most cases, artists didn't really have much of a choice what with the restrictions in censorship. In the wake of the revolutions of the 19th and 20th Centuries, when social classes started uplifting themselves, the prevalence of the working-class hero and the artistic modes to represent them gained increasing currency.
Related to Farm Boy. See also Book Dumb, Almighty Janitor. For a more negative example, see Social Climber, who is usually regarded as a working-class villain, in that the working-class hero does not deny his roots or forgets about his family and where he comes from. Can overlap with Science Hero depending on the job."
t26275,WorthyOpponent,"When the hero and the villain clash repeatedly, over time they may develop respect for their opponent's abilities. After all, their adversary is able to keep rising to oppose them battle after battle. In the heat of battle the hero or villain's true capabilities and determination could be revealed. Or perhaps one of them was simply looking for a challenge. For whatever reason, the battles have created a sense of respect (which may or may not be mutual).
This leads to a declaration by one of the two that they have found their adversary a worthy challenge, or some variation of that. It can be privately said or publicly admitted; what matters is that the character in question acknowledges and respects their opponent for their skill. Should one side actually come out on top or find out the other has fallen, it may lead to Sympathy for the Devil, Sympathy for the Hero, or an Antagonist in Mourning.
This declaration is more commonly made by villains than heroes, given that the villain's less scrupulous nature doesn't exactly help earn a hero's respect. The exceptions to this tend to involve Spirited Competitors or otherwise less principled characters on the heroic side, or a Noble Demon on the villainous side. Compare Evil Virtues, wherein the heroes may recognize some admirable quality in an otherwise-villainous character.
Expect to hear Combat Compliments. This can lead to The Only One Allowed to Defeat You, depending on the mindset of the character making this statement. See also Friendly Enemy and Evil Counterpart. Can overlap with Enemies Equals Greatness. The idea of this trope is deliberately designed to sail over the head of the Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy as they can only think about beating their foes and being the best with zero regard for the battle itself (the realization that, yes, you can respect your opponent/the battle you shared and still be a great fighter is the key turning point in their Character Development)."
t26279,WouldHurtAChild,"In fiction and in the media, both heroes and villains often agree on one thing: they Wouldn't Hurt a Child.
This creed exists for various reasons: it may be because Children Are Innocent, and thus should be protected and kept out of harm's way at all costs; it may be because, to Moral Guardians, seeing a child being brutalized is Harmful to Minors and thus should be avoided; it may also be because even writers mostly disagree with the idea of writing about harming a child.
But sometimes, some people just don't agree with that. Or just don't care. And, they do hurt children, sometimes even kill them, in defiance of the Improbable Infant Survival. Indeed, the act of harming a child usually comes off as the ultimate act of villainy.
Needless to say, this trope is almost always a Kick the Dog moment. Hence, the presence of Would Hurt A Child is often telltale of a Crapsack World or at least a Darker and Edgier series. However, it is surprisingly easy to subvert this trope simply by using Kids Are Cruel (the flip side of Children Are Innocent) and combining it with Pay Evil unto Evil. Does a soldier shooting a child soldier still seem like an ultimate villain?
And want to go all the way? Make the children creepy or, even better, make them Enfant Terribles and, this time, hurting said children will look much less as a Moral Event Horizon crossing, even though there will always be some Moral Guardians or Papa Wolf / Mama Bear to complain. This may also be done by a Complete Monster to establish that even a villain has lines s/he won't dare cross. Naturally, the Friend to All Children sees this type of character as a mortal enemy, unless they are a religious figure such as Jesus, in which case would be taking them to a better place anyhow.
In Western works, this trope is rare and almost always done off-panel when played straight (read: when the violence towards the child isn't being stopped in the nick of time and causes actual damage) largely due to broadcast standards; it's a little more common in literature but still not very much so. In Japanese fiction, child brutality can be more common but is often framed in a very specific way (again, to conform to their SP) and has actually faded somewhat in the new millenium over content concerns.
Important Note: This trope is about adults physically hurting children, fatally or not. The following are not examples: slapping, spanking and general discipline from parents to their children (unless the child is at risk of death or serious injury as a result of such discipline, that's Don't Make Me Take My Belt Off), psychological/verbal abuse (very common but not that trope), abduction (only applies if the child dies or gets effectively hurt), child on child violence (that's Kids Are Cruel), exploitation for profit by the parents if they aren't hurt (that is Financial Abuse). Violence to teenagers, with the exception of some of those in their early teens, isn't an example either since teenagers are physically stronger than children and lack the ""completely defenseless"" element, especially if Teens Are Monsters. However, teenagers harming children applies.
There is also an interesting Double Standard when it comes to characters applying for this trope, since they are almost Always Male. 
Rarely are women described as being physically violent to children. Even rarer are the instances when they actually kill them. Indeed, killing children is among the few things that permanently prevent a woman from a convenient High-Heel–Face Turn. Extra points if the killing is done directly and at the woman's hands (i.e. stabbing, strangling etc...). Compare Pædo Hunt, another child abuse trope where female perpetrators are similarly unheard of.
A subtrope of Kick the Dog. Frequently a cause of Adult Fear. Burn the Orphanage is a particular form of this. See also Child Hater, who hates kids but isn't necessarily physically abusive and Nice Job Breaking It, Herod!, which is often an extreme version. If they're not stopped in time by the heroes, this overlaps with Death of a Child. Contrast Improbable Infant Survival and Wouldn't Hurt a Child. Compare Kids Are Cruel, Children Are Innocent. Related to Eats Babies and Child Eater. Usually applies to the Sadist Teacher. If a villain who is quite capable of bothering adults prefers to spend his time as an antagonist for kids or teenagers, it's fair to say Pick on Someone Your Own Size. For the role-reversed example of this trope, see Double Standard: Violence, Child on Adult, in which case it's a child physically harming an adult for comedic effect."
t26324,WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants,"Some authors plan meticulously. Before they even start to write, they have a detailed plot synopsis, character biographies, pages on the setting, and a detailed backstory to the main tale...at the least.
Others just sit down at their word processor and type whatever comes into their head. This trope is dedicated to them.
This is not necessarily a trope about authors who simply write without a speck of planning at all (although it can be), but rather those who, overall, are improvising as they write. They may already have invented their characters, perhaps they have a vague plot bubbling in their head, even a few notes on backstory or setting. What separates this kind of writing from planned writing is that these writers are prepared to throw those notes in the trash the moment they come up with an idea that they prefer. So you're writing a hardboiled crime fiction novel: Remember that takeaway place you thought up on the spot to give your sleuth somewhere to eat his lunch? That would be perfect as a front for the Big Bad's drug-dealing business. Making a movie? That actor's take on that character is way better than what you originally had in mind. Why not rewrite half his part to take advantage of that vision?
This does not always happen voluntary, mind you. In some cases, the writer did indeed have a carefully planned storyline in mind until it was suddenly struck down by either Executive Meddling, an Executive Veto, or some other case of Real Life Writes the Plot, and the writer had to scramble against the deadline to come with a replacement story.
This is especially common for manga writers making comics for serial magazines, because of the nature of that business in Japan; they must get out at least one completed installment done for each magazine issue, or risk ending their source of income and livelihood. Because writing well is incredibly hard to do, and the schedule of a mangaka is one of the most ridiculous in the publishing world◊, writers frequently resort to this trope just to get an issue out there! Sometimes it even forces widely published and respected artists to put out chapters they clearly had not even finished drawing.
The trope name comes from the phrase ""flying by the seat of your pants,"" a colloquialism for ""deciding a course of action as you go along.""
Like most things, this can be done well, or badly. Aborted Arc, The Chris Carter Effect, and Kudzu Plot are what happens when Writing by the Seat of Your Pants leaves too many loose plot threads.
This is the novelistic version of Schrödinger's Gun or the Indy Ploy; when the author of a series canonizes fan suggestions as he goes along, see Ascended Fanon. Can also be related to I Just Write the Thing. Compare Off the Rails where a GM may be forced to improvise as players break away from the planned story. Contrast The Producer Thinks of Everything and Developers' Foresight, where the creative team behind a project has meticulously planned every facet of their story or game.
Please only add examples where the author admitted to doing this. This is not a page for speculation."
t26326,WritingIndentationClue,"When people write a letter or a note, it's possible that the pressure of their pen or pencil will create indentations not just on the paper they're writing on, but on any paper that's underneath it, too. In some sorts of story (particularly Mystery Fiction, though not exclusively), making use of this fact is a well-established investigative technique. If you want to know what someone wrote on a notepad but the note is no longer there, just look at the next piece, possibly shading it with a pencil to bring out the contrast.
In certain genres and at certain times, this trope has been common enough that a savvy villain might take steps to avoid it, such as by taking several sheets from a notepad, or slipping a piece of cardboard between the top two sheets, to prevent the pesky detective from doing this.
A number of variations on this exist—for example, it isn't always paper that the indentation gets made on. A similar concept from the time when writing involved a lot of wet ink was to look at the blotting paper (used to absorb excess ink). Carbon-copy and triplicate-copy paper are designed to take advantage of this, allowing the impression to release ink so that multiple copies are written or typed at once.
Subtrope of Invisible Writing, and sister trope to Condensation Clue."
t26363,Xenofiction,"A few works of Science Fiction and Fantasy (and, in some cases even realistic fiction) take the Point of View of normal animals, Intellectual Animals, Intelligent Gerbils, or Starfish Aliens. More than that, the creators of such stories take great pains to think through what it would actually be like to be a rabbit, a dolphin, or a giant betentacled being who smells colour.
A good rule of thumb for figuring out if something is in this genre or not: if you can replace the non-humans with (maybe superpowered) humans without too much trouble, it's probably not Xenofiction: Beast Fables and works about Funny Animals are, in general, not examples. Likewise in many a Mouse World, size is often the only major difference between humans and non-humans; though there is Xenofiction featuring non-humans with great differences in size.
If it's taking place under the nose of humans, there may or may not have a Masquerade, and humans will probably either be bastards or eldritch abominations. If humans are taking place under the nose of it, you may have Humans Are Interesting. Xenofiction usually explores Bizarre Alien Psychology.
See Xenofictional Literature for an index of Xenofiction.
Contrast Most Writers Are Human. Compare to Narrative-Driven Nature Documentary for nature documentaries that anthropomorphise the animals.
Not to be confused with Xenafication, or the Xeno games."
t26375,XtremeKoolLetterz,"Certain letterz of the English alphabetz are just ""kewler"" than others. As such, many peoplez will intentionalli mizzpel wordz by xubztituting ðese letterz, in the hopez that this will draw moar attentshun from young peoplez and make the rezult look moar youþ-oriented.
Whether this actually works on the youth crowd is debatable; this is a pop-culture phenomenon that comes and goes like many other fads, sometimes losing its appeal almost immediately out of the gate.
Although, when it is used, it is often Played for Laughs to point out marketing groups that fail to understand an audience or, more often, weak attempts to seem hip to the younger generation.
The most common substitutionz are:
Less-common variantz include:
Interestingly, this trope tends to favor letters constructed primarily from hard straight lines and sharp angles — ""X,"" ""K,"" ""Z,"" so on. These letters are also worth many points in English-language Scrabble, though examples of this trope would probably not be considered legal words.
This can also extend to acronyms/abbreviations/initializations to make them more memorable, even if the chosen letter isn't, technically, the one in the original word. ""X-Tensible Markup Language,"" for example, is easier to remember by its initialization of ""XML"" than ""EML"".
""Leet speak"" (or ""1337"") can be considered this trope played to extremes, where almost every normal letter is replaced by some form of ""extreme"" counterpart, which to those unfamiliar with the meme can vary anywhere from ""slightly different"" to ""utterly unreadable,"" depending on how ""hardcore"" the user wishes to appear; it's believed that leet originated from the crackingnote ""Hacker"" is a case of You Keep Using That Word community, which may explain why it's never spread beyond circles of computer geeks, online gamers, and Homestucks.
""Text speak,"" originating in IM and a popular shorthand for use with mobile phones, is similar to ""1337,"" though the hardcore consider it a different language.
One possible justification for Xtreme Kool Letterz in Real Life is that, at least in the United States, ""common words"" cannot be trademarked as-is, but deliberate misspellings can.
The overall trope is Older Than Television, and possibly Older Than Radio, with deliberate misspellings being used for humor at least since the Victorian era. (And back then, of course, semiliteracy was such a problem that many otherwise articulate people unintentionally misspelled words, making this trope not only comical but also satirical.) In academic study of English, this is known as ""sensational spelling"".
Xtreme Kool Letterz shows up around this wiki as well, with titles such as Friends of Really Kool Sobriquet, and yes, this article.

t26457,YouCantFightFate,"A character gains knowledge of an event that is about to happen whether by prophecy or time travel and they attempt to change it, but it comes true anyway. (Often it happens because of those attempts). It's as old as Oedipus Rex, used by Shakespeare and Tolkien, and still fresh at least as recently as the mid-80s sitcom!
This trope will usually turn out one of three ways:
Note that this is the exact inverse of the common Western portrayal of fate as an outside force of some sort, acting to ""guide"" outcomes in real time as they progress — both of these opposite notions fall under the concept of ""You Can't Fight Fate"".
If the prophecy comes true because of being made (in the most common scenario, because of everyone's attempts to prevent it), it's a case of a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy. If the universe appears to self-correct any attempt at change, then Ontological Inertia is in play. In any case, on the Sliding Scale of Free Will vs. Fate, stories where You Can't Fight Fate register as Type 1 on the scale.
Since it's Older Than Dirt, most examples rely on a Prophecy Twist. If time travel is involved, You Already Changed the Past. See also Stable Time Loop and Prescience Is Predictable.
The Fatalist is characterized by their strong belief in fate.
Compare with Because Destiny Says So, But Thou Must!, Prophecies Are Always Right. Contrast with Screw Destiny and Immune to Fate."
t26494,YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness,"To show or remind the viewer how nasty the Big Bad or his Evil Minions are, a common trope is their habit of callously disposing of anyone who is no longer useful to their plans, whether it be an associate of an evil organization who has just concluded their useful function within that organization, or an outsider who the villain has coerced or tricked into carrying out part of their plan who is killed once they have done what the villain has ordered. It is often punctuated with words to the effect of ""You have outlived your usefulness"" or ""you have served your purpose"" before the murder.
In the case of a bribed outsider who was only loyal for the promise of money, this does make a little sense. Not only does the Big Bad avoid having to pay them for services rendered, but they remove a direct link back to them as the master of the plot. And there's always the fact that someone loyal to the money more than the cause is a risk to betray the Big Bad to whoever offers them more. Alternatively, it could be to punish a minion for asking for a raise, especially when done right before the critical mission, with the implication that the minion is aware of their own importance and intends to use that as leverage. This is an especially common tactic for dealing with those who betrayed their own side on the villain's orders, who villains will often have Rewarded as a Traitor Deserves - villains are a rather backstabbing lot, and are rather not keen on getting backstabbed themselves.
A particularly callous villain may also do this to an underling who has been defeated, combining this trope with You Have Failed Me. May also happen to a villain who thought he was the Big Bad, but forgot that Evil Is Not a Toy or expected the Sealed Evil in a Can to be loyal to him after its release. More realistically, the victim in question may be privy to information that the villain doesn't want to get out — as the pirates say: ""Dead men tell no tales.""
Then you have any kind of predatory monster who just thinks there's no point in wasting good meat. Alternatively, you have the villain who notes their underlings do still have some usefulness... but said usefulness doesn't necessarily mean they need to be alive to serve it.
Finally, sociopathic villains are notorious for viewing people as little more than tools to be used and then discarded once they've served their purpose, with this trope being perhaps the ultimate form of this callous attitude.
If the Big Bad is also particularly annoyed by how his Evil Minions have functioned in their role, he may use The Blofeld Ploy.
A variant of this trope is common when a villain who has enlisted the help of the oblivious heroes reveals his true villainy, the comment usually following his gloating of how they played right into his hands. This version of the trope has a noticeably lower success rate, and trying it on The Hero is tantamount to suicide.
Compare You Have Failed Me (when the executed underlings are killed because they didn't succeed), Rewarded as a Traitor Deserves, We Have Reserves, and Uriah Gambit. Shoot the Builder and Eat the Summoner are subtropes. Contrast Can't Kill You, Still Need You and Mook Depletion. See also Villainous Demotivator and Even Mooks Have Loved Ones.
WARNING: As this is somewhat of a Death Trope (in many cases, at least), there are spoilers, so read at your own risk!"
t26550,YourCheatingHeart,"Two-timing, playing away from home, having a bit on the side, going behind your partner's back, adultery, infidelity... There are a lot of names for cheating on your partner, but most of them have the same outcome: a world of hurt.
Most of us recognize this type of plot: Bob is married to Alice. One day, Bob sees Carol at a club and is attracted to her. Perhaps things haven't been going so well with Alice for some time. Maybe they just had a major fight and Bob stormed off. Or maybe his marriage is perfectly healthy, and Bob has no excuse. Whatever the reason, Bob flirts with Carol, which eventually leads to a sexual or romantic relationship and the various things that entails. But here's the thing: Bob doesn't tell Alice about it. He doesn't dump her, he doesn't tell her that he thinks the marriage is on the rocks, he doesn't talk to her about Polyamory or swinging, he doesn't even ask for ""more space"". He continues to play the part of her husband, and expects her to continue being his wife, hoping that Alice won't notice when he starts coming in late for dinner, or ask him about the mysterious expenditures on their joint account. Sometimes, just to really play Alice for a sucker, their marriage will seemingly improve— he buys Alice gifts, pays attention to her and seems much happier, but all the while he's running off to see Carol. For extra scumbag points, he may be keeping Carol similarly in the dark about Alice. Chances are he'll eventually get caught; if he didn't, the story wouldn't have the same dramatic impact. A lot of angst and tension will ensue.
Way back in the day, when marriage was considered permanent and divorce was a word whispered fearfully by gossiping old ladies, The Affair was a shocker of a storyline, and very often an automatic Moral Event Horizon for the cheating partner. However, it's worth noting that even further back in the day, the gods, goddesses and minor side characters of mythology listed ""infidelity"" under ""Hobbies"", didn't particularly care if their new ""partner"" was willing, and got away with it. Only their mortal lovers got the nasty side of the wronged wife's/husband's temper when the affair was discovered.
Nowadays, affairs are common in any Soap Opera and turn up an awful lot in other types of story as well. We don't really expect a fictional husband and wife to stay faithful to each other for forty or so years. Supposedly, a solid marriage makes a boring story (though some would disagree). Often, a sequence of ""get together → one cheats → they break up → they make up → the other one cheats"", and so on) will be followed so often and so tiresomely that it becomes a Yoyo Plot Point.
What defines cheating usually depends on the context of the story and the characters involved. Stories aimed at younger audiences, or with a clear emphasis on romantic, monogamous relationships, will probably count kissing and flirting as cheating. Most examples of cheating in shows aimed at adults, however, will involve sex. Occasionally, characters may clash specifically because they have different definitions of cheating: for example, the husband who protests that he was drunk and it was ""just a kiss"" to his furious wife, or a girlfriend who can't understand why her boyfriend doesn't like her flirting with her male friends.
A few rules usually hold true in fiction: If a woman cheats, her paramour just scored a massive victory over her cuckolded husband, who is now permanently dishonored. The (male) big boss of any given workplace is likely to be two-timing his wife. The Protagonist remains sympathetic if they cheat, and becomes an innocent, wronged victim if they are the one being cheated on. Bisexuals are portrayed as incapable of faithfulness or have merely informed sexuality, and men are more prone to having affairs than women (and often portrayed as The Unfair Sex too when it comes to cheating).
Unfortunately, adultery is Truth in Television, as many broken hearts and broken families will testify. It is also one of the most common reasons that people murder each other."
t26668,DownerEnding,"1. A finale to a movie, a TV series or an episode of that TV series, a video game, or some other form of media that ends things in a way that varies from sad to tragic. These tend to be rare, as there is overwhelming pressure to tie loose ends up in a ""happy"" way. Sometimes done as a way to assure that the show, once canceled, cannot be revived later (similar to the Grand Finale), but sometimes leaves the show on a cliffhanger.
2. A similarly low-key or unhappy ending to an episode of a normally ""happy"" series. Also rare, due to the same reasons as above. Sometimes used in an attempt to get Emmy nominations, or to at least surprise the viewer. When the series finale of an otherwise ""happy"" series is one of these, it's a Sudden Downer Ending.
Downer endings have effectively been used to drive home an episode's Aesop. For some issues, it's the only effective way to deliver the message.
Sometimes, a downer ending can conclude the character arcs in a very satisfying way, despite (or because of) being dark, if the characters are Villain Protagonists and people feel that they got what was coming to them. This no absolute rule however and there are cases where the audience can have enough sympathy and pity for the characters in question especially if they sympathetic qualities and poignant moments that can lead more into an Alas, Poor Villain perspective. Other times, it can be overused to the point it feels like a Mandatory Twist Ending. If it comes out of nowhere or is the result of an Ass Pull, then it may be the result of the writers summoning Diabolus ex Machina. If enough people consider it fundamentally unjust, it may acquire the Fanon Discontinuity and Snicket Warning Labels.
Kill 'Em All, Shoot the Shaggy Dog and The Bad Guy Wins are particularly cruel variations of this. A Prequel may require one, or both; the Happy Ending was Doomed by Canon.
If the ending mixes elements of happiness and Downer Ending, then it's a Bittersweet Ending. If the whole adventure leading up to it turned out to be meaningless, then it's Shoot the Shaggy Dog. The Cliffhanger is often a Downer Ending, but one implicitly not final; tune in next time to see how they retrieve this one.
See also Gainax Ending, Last Breath Bullet, Crapsack World, Yank the Dog's Chain, and It's a Wonderful Failure. Occasionally, part of a Tragedy or an Utsuge. Sometimes a Foregone Conclusion, either because of a historical setting or if the work is a Prequel. The hero may or may not die. Some video games feature this as a Non-Standard Game Over. Realization of an Inferred Holocaust may turn even the most Tastes Like Diabetes ""happy ending"" into one. Downer Endings easily lead to Tear Jerkers or Nightmare Fuel. Compare Downer Beginning. Contrast Happy Ending.
Note: This is a Spoilered Rotten trope, that means that EVERY SINGLE EXAMPLE on this list is a spoiler by default and most of them will be unmarked. This is your last warning, only proceed if you really believe you can handle this list."
t26723,SpannerInTheWorks,"Whether it's The Ditz, The Fool, Inspector Oblivious, or a monkey, this miscreant is capable of derailing the most ironclad plan by unknowingly taking a third option. They ruin the implausible Gambit Roulettes by exploiting their one, intrinsic flaw: their reliance on Contrived Coincidences, rigid patterns, and the assumption that nobody would be stupid enough to actually push the Big Red Button or fight the ''apparently'' unstoppable robot.
How can they outdo the master at his own game with nothing but stupidity and clumsiness? It's precisely because these characters are the fools and tools of fate that they are uniquely placed to derail these schemes with the gentleness of a butterfly flapping its wings... of doom!
Put another way, they are an author's walking deconstruction or Lampshade Hanging of the Theory of Narrative Causality: just as easily as a plot can come together, it can be pulled apart with the tiniest, most ridiculous things.
These characters are the worst nightmare of The Chessmaster, Smug Snake, Manipulative Bastard, and Magnificent Bastard, and the bane of many a Clock King.
When the character ruins a protagonist's plans by unknowingly doing something small but crucial, he becomes an Unwitting Instigator of Doom. When the Spanner can trigger a series of coincidences, it's Disaster Dominoes. When the plan is screwed and the character is also aware that he will screw the plan, and doesn't care, he becomes a Leeroy Jenkins. Occasionally, may be Mistaken for Badass. If the focus isn't on them, they're often an Unknown Character.
Compare Finagle's Law, It Began with a Twist of Fate, Nice Job Fixing It, Villain!, Outside-Context Problem, Remembered Too Late.
Opposite of the Unwitting Pawn, often is the Unwitting Pawn until the final crucial moment. This is the main cause of Didn't See That Coming, this trope being the ""that"". Quite often an Achievement In Ignorance. Inverse of Unintentional Backup Plan, where a character accidentally completes an imperfect plan that would have otherwise failed. Compare with Out-Gambitted, where someone's plan is successful but ineffective against a better-thought-out plan. Compare Too Dumb to Fool, where the character is too stupid even to be baffled by explanations. Also, compare Evil Cannot Comprehend Good, where the flaw is that the villain can't see someone being generous or brave or honest enough to foul up his plan.
Specialty of The Fool. See also Didn't See That Coming, The Dog Bites Back, Who's Laughing Now?
The trope is reputedly named for the Industrial Revolution-era practice of disgruntled workers throwing a spanner into a machine, either because of fears machines would put them out of work, or as a bargaining chip for better working conditions (and often because they were the only ones who knew how to repair the machines as well).
(Note for Americans reading this: ""Spanner"" is the Queen's English word for what you would call a ""wrench"", with the added benefit of it being slang for a stupid person. It has nothing to do with a Long Runner in development. The equivalent American phrase specifically involves a monkey wrench, known in the UK as a gas grip — ""He really threw a monkey wrench into my plans."")
Not to be confused with A Spaniard in the Works, which was a 1965 book by John Lennon of nonsensical sketches and drawings whose title was a wordplay on this expression.
Disgruntled French workers did this by throwing sabots (wooden-soled clogs) into machinery - giving us the word sabotage.
Often an ending trope, spoilers may be ahead."
t26776,WholePlotReference,"Sometimes rather than just a brief reference or homage to some other work of fiction, a work will actually be a full-blown recreation of something else's story. This is usually done in sitcoms, and likely a spoof to at least some degree.
See also Homage, Foreign Remake, Fountain of Expies, Characteristic Trope, and Recycled In SPACE... sometimes with the Serial Numbers Filed Off.
Expect it to reference/parody the original's Signature Scenes.
Tropes Are Not Bad — a story can serve as a reference or re-mixed version of another one without just ripping it off. Clever parodies put a lot of their own creative thought in while still referencing the original.
Compare Parody Episode, Whole Costume Reference (the clothing version), Recycled Script (internal recycling). May be a Twice-Told Tale. For when this is subverted, see Not His Sled. The opposite would be a Shallow Parody, which claims to be a parody but has almost no real references to either the plot or any other aspect of the target."
t26803,NonMammalianMammaries,"Look closely at a female reptile, a female amphibian, a female bird, a female fish, a female insect, or most mammals that aren't human or primate. You'll doubtless notice the lack of a particular characteristic that is common to female humans. Most animals do not have human-like breasts at all, even if they fall into the category ""mammal"". Compare the bellies of a male and female dog, or even the chest of a female gorilla, and you won't find much difference unless she's recently given birth to a litter and is nursing young (that's about the only time she will ever have any vague semblance of what we call ""breasts"" on humans).
Regardless of this, artists tend to oversize the mammaries of characters that do have them, or put them in places where they don't belong. Prominent breasts, or lack thereof, is one of the simplest visual cues for humanoids. Giving all female animals big boobs, or at least a body shape that mimics them, allows for distinction between the sexes without adding glaringly obvious costume tags, a wasp waist, or the more bizarre gender-specific characteristics in some other animals that the audience may very well be unable to recognize as sexual dimorphism. In such works, male animals are not neccesarily given obvious pectorals. This can be said for most male cartoon characters, and not just male animals.
If the character is an alien or artificial life form, then it makes a little bit more sense. Aliens have Bizarre Alien Biology after all, and creators of synthoids and such would probably want their ""children"" to be anthropomorphic enough to fit in. Not to mention that it's easier to design a skin-tight rubber bodysuit with strange textures for use by human actors. However, it tends to make a lot less sense when applied to avian and reptilian races of creatures or aliens. Breasts are for nursing young, and for an Avian with a nice hard beak (especially those with curved or hooked beaks), that would be incredibly painful. Reptiles often have sharp teeth and often strong jaws, too, same with some fish. Remember, breasts are primarily for nursing young — not just to look sexy.
This is extremely common in the Furry Fandom, though some furries prefer to just portray a reptile, avian, amphibian, or their mythical couterparts (Gryphons and Dragons) without them for anatomical purposes. Even when this trope is averted in canon, it seldom stops the Fan-Artists. There is also the school of thought of multiple breasts on aliens or furries, but that's a completely different subject altogether.
Just in case male non-mammals feel left out, note that external genitalia and nipples are also a ""mammal thing"", and their presence in male creatures from other taxonomic groups is a variant of this trope.
This Trope is sometimes found with Non-Mammalian Hair, hair being something else that only mammals have but is often added to non-mammalian females. Compare Sexy Dimorphism, Organic Bra, Multiboobage, Secondary Sexual Characteristics, Tertiary Sexual Characteristics, and Feather Fingers. Contrast Animals Lack Attributes, when procreative parts that animals rightly should have are omitted."
t26837,SchoolStudyMedia,"Those works of fiction that people tend to study at school, often called the ""canon"". You can tell these by how many fanfics at Fan Fiction Dot Net have the writer telling you they wrote it for a school assignment and how many people on Facebook have them listed as their ""favorite book"" even though they never mention reading anything else. Often where we are taught how to plant Epileptic Trees and first learn that Everyone Is Jesus in Purgatory.
Almost none of them were written with the intent of being studied and analyzed in a classroom, and most of them were definitely not written for kids. However, there are two things that most of them share: historical and/or philosophical context, and a deeper meaning in every scene. In fact, these media often not being for kids can be used to help develop the maturity of students as they come to understand darker truths and realities about life.
It should also be noted that while everything on this list has held this distinction, a lot of them have had a revolving door as far as how often they are used. Some have stayed more consistent. That's typical; different generations and different areas have different ideas about some things. In other words, your ""I read this in school"" may also be ""Why didn't I get this in school"" to someone else. Even so, these works comprise their respective Canons because they reflect the ideas which have meant the most over time to the societies which uphold them.

t26873,FictionalDocument,"All the books, magazines, and newspapers that exist only within a fictional world, from the Necronomicon to the mysteries of Jessica Fletcher. They are more common in Speculative Fiction, but not restricted to it.
They serve two main narrative purposes: verisimilitude and exposition. Jessica is supposed to be an author; it would be bizarre if no trace of the books she writes existed. Reading the Necronomicon may frighten the protagonist half to death, but it also gives the reader an idea of the backstory.
Fictional documents are also used to comment on literary tropes, and as aids to characterisation. Characters comparing their own predicament with their favourite book can get very sarcastic about how unrealistic it was, while few things so embarrass the Action Girl as having her little brother read aloud a few choice passages from her favourite romance. Sometimes, however, you may just have to Take Our Word for It.
Sister trope to Show Within a Show, Fictional Video Game, and Fictional Painting.
Common types of fictional document include:
If your story is made entirely of Fictional Documents, it's a Scrapbook Story (so please list it there rather than here); if the paratext quotes from these, it's quoting the Encyclopedia Exposita. And if the story itself appears in the story, it's Recursive Canon. If it merely claims to have been written by a character within the setting, it probably falls under Direct Line to the Author. In Video Games, they are almost always used as Flavor Text.
Occasionally prone to Defictionalization."
t26889,AppetiteEqualsHealth,"In fiction, being hungry and eating well often means being healthy. Adult characters are especially pleased with their children's healthy appetite. Conversely, if it's noted that a character hasn't eaten anything or that they have no appetite, there's a good chance that they're sick.
This has a basis in reality because there are many diseases that cause lack of appetite as a symptom (although there are also quite a few that have Inappropriate Hunger as a symptom as well). It's also a good sign since, presumably, if the mind's free enough to worry about the stomach, it might not be consumed with other problems such as other types of discomfort.
This trope is often paired with Soup Is Medicine because it's often fed to sick people in fiction for its healing properties. It often appears in Sick Episodes.
Compare with Hyperactive Metabolism which is a video game dynamic that takes the ideas behind this and extend them to unrealistic levels. Compare to Forgets to Eat, where a lack of appetite indicates obsessive interest in a topic, rather than (or at least not necessarily) ill health, and Too Unhappy to Be Hungry where a lack of appetite indicates poor mood rather than health."
t26943,PutOnABus,"So you're a film or TV show producer or the author of a book series, or the team behind a comic book, and you have a problem. You want a character out of the story, but you don't want to kill them off, you're not going to just flat out ignore them, and you certainly wouldn't have them just disappear for no reason and with no mention of it. However, there is a situation in which a character can be written out of a series in such a way that they can easily be returned later, if the creators so choose. They are Put on a Bus.
A staple of the Prime Time Soap and particularly Soap Opera where casts are large and actor turnover is frequent. Conveniently, when such a character is brought back and now played by a different actor, it can be a case of Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome or The Other Darrin. Often a case of Real Life Writes the Plot, due to actors leaving a franchise for various reasons.
If the character doesn't leave in such a way that arranging a return would be simple, this becomes a Long Bus Trip. If they return once, it's The Bus Came Back. Should they start appearing infrequently, they're Commuting on a Bus or Out of Focus. If there's obvious malice involved in the character's departure, then they've been Put on a Bus to Hell. There's also the chance of a Bus Crash or dying on the bus.
The bus in question may be a Convenient Coma.
Opposite of Dropped a Bridge on Him. Compare with Chuck Cunningham Syndrome (a character disappearing from the show without explanation and never being mentioned again) and What Happened to the Mouse? (where the story continues with a character's final fate left unknown). See also Absentee Actor and Written-In Absence, for when a character disappears for only an episode or two."
t26968,InfantImmortality,"In most fiction, innocent characters (babies, children, dogs) sit very high on the Sorting Algorithm of Mortality. They tend to make it out of dangerous situations unharmed while many adult characters in these same situations do not.
No matter how bad the villain is, he will stop short of killing a child. Even natural disasters seem to avoid killing infants and dogs and since they obviously have no such choice it is always because of Contrived Coincidence. Something about a baby or puppy makes you stop, think twice, and show a last flicker of compassion. Those who don't have that last drop of humanity in them will generally be stopped from completing that act of evil some other way.
Of course, this only protects against killing them off on screen; destroying a city in a fiery conflagration and killing the no doubt tens or hundreds of thousands of babies therein is A-OK because A Million Is a Statistic and the audience won't see them.
This trope extends to just about anyone conventionally considered inherently ""innocent"", and can therefore sometimes reach out to cover the mentally handicapped. Whether or not this extends to pregnant women is a toss-up; fetuses have more relative protection than dogs, but less than already-born infants. Except in series where Status Quo Is God, because then the Convenient Miscarriage will rear its ugly head.
Note that this doesn't seem to apply to the Enfant Terrible, who dies horribly in all manner of works.
Compare Only Fatal to Adults, when something by definition does not hurt children, in-universe. In video games, this is a reason to Hide Your Children.
Compare and contrast Censored Child Death, when the death still occurs but is downplayed compared to other deaths in the story."
t27052,OurDragonsAreDifferent,"Nearly every culture has myths about something called a ""dragon"", despite the fact none of them can agree on exactly what dragons are. How big are they? What do they look like? How many heads do they have? Do they breathe fire? Or ice? Do they fly (and if so, with or without wings)? How many legs do they have? Are they dumb as planks, or superintelligent? Are they low scaly pests, or ultra-rare Uber-serpents ancient and powerful as the Earth itself? Are they benevolent? Malevolent or even outright demonic? Are they divine entities or spirits, or just really cool animals? They could even be aliens, in some works of fiction.
The answers to these questions generally fall within two traditions, ""Western"" and ""Eastern"". Even then, in addition to cultural differences, dragons fall into a very wide range of types even in one local mythology.
Eastern dragons, such as in the Eastern Zodiac, come from different traditions and as such aren't technically the same monster as their Western counterparts; Westerners who encountered stories and images of Chinese lóng and Japanese tatsu/ryuu sprung on the similarities to the European dragon and couldn't think of anything better to call them.
Western dragons or European dragons are derived from Greek and Roman mythology and may have been influenced by the cultures of the Ancient Near East. Eastern dragons or more specifically Chinese dragons, derive from ancient Chinese mythology dating back 7000 years ago and these depictions spread throughout Eastern Asia. The reason for Chinese dragon worship is likely because the region of Northern China where Chinese civilization first began was filled with dinosaur fossils which led to the development of dragon myths. Northern China is still considered a huge ""dinosaur hot spot"" in palaeontology today. There are many other dragons in the East such as Makara deriving from Indian mythology but the Chinese dragon and its variants spreading from Japan to Bhutan is by far the most well-known.
Even within these traditions, however, there is much variability. This has increased in modern times, as Western and Eastern authors have blurred the traditions by mixing and matching attributes from both (benign Western dragons are quite popular these days, for instance). Some authors invent completely new attributes to set their dragons apart from the crowd or just make them cooler. And some authors put dragons in their stories just for the sole reason of making a story look cool.
The western dragon has a number of variants◊. Some appear in mythology and folklore, others are a more recent invention.
Further, it's also become fairly common for dragons to come in different flavors of Elemental Powers, especially in settings where Elemental Rock–Paper–Scissors are enforced. This may simply manifest in their Breath Weapon, or it may affect all properties of the dragon. Elemental rainbows of dragons are most common in video games and tabletop games where diversity of creatures and gameplay balance are considerations. While fire remains the most common breath weapon among fictional dragons, ice or freezing air is a common alternate — ice dragons tend to show up as one-off variants, often in contrast to ""regular"" fire dragons, even when other types of elemental dragons do not. When multiple types of breath weapons are possible, poison, acid and lightning are common choices. Undead dragons are also not unheard of, usually breathing ice or poison.
As mentioned above, a recent trend has been to try and make dragons that could actually exist in the real world. Naturally, these tend to either use Science Fiction concepts or be very different from traditional dragons. Also common in later works is a tendency for dragons to form a life-long bond with any human or humanoid who is present when they hatch (probably inspired by the 'imprinting' which occurs with most birds in Real Life, which is why birds raised in captivity with the intent to be released must be cared for by puppets). This gives writers a way to give dragons unique psychology without having to come up with unique motivations for them. It also explains why humanoid Dragon Riders can boss them around. Yet another trend appearing here and there is for dragons to be depicted as looking similar to dinosaurs, usually the bigger theropods (like Tyrannosaurus rex), but occasionally sauropods (such as Brachiosaurus) as well. The two are often outright confused with each other. Another common trend in modern fantasy is the miniature pet dragon, suitable for perching on one's shoulder.
Compare Giant Flyer, Kirin and other Dragon Tropes. Supertrope to Cat-like Dragons, Dracolich, Draconic Abomination, Draconic Humanoid, Dragon Ancestry, Dinosaurs Are Dragons, Dragons are Demonic, Dragons Are Divine, Feathered Dragons, Lazy Dragon, Seahorses Are Dragons, Shoulder-Sized Dragon and Weredragon.
Not to be confused with The Dragon, a position only sometimes held by a real dragon (while dragons themselves can just as easily be Big Bads)."
t27188,MalaProper,"The distinguishing characteristic of the Malaproper is that they constantly replace words with similar-sounding but wrong ones. A common form of this is for the Malaproper to mangle proverbs, idioms, and other figures of speech. They may use overly complicated synonyms that make them sound wrong; e.g., ""The cat's out of the bag"" becomes ""The feline has been released from the sack!"" Alternatively, they may use words that sound almost right — ""Let's get this shoe on the toad!"" for ""Let's get this show on the road!"" They may also nonsensically combine figures of speech (""You can't cross the same river without breaking a few eggs""). (See Mixed Metaphor.) This character will sometimes be corrected, not that this does any good.
The term ""malaproper"" comes from ""malapropism"", a reference to Mrs. Malaprop, a character from the 1775 play The Rivals by Richard Brinsley Sheridan whose name, in turn, is derived from malapropos, an adjective or adverb meaning ""inappropriate"" or ""inappropriately"". Mrs. Malaprop's name and character were based on the idea of making malapropos statements.
(Although the trope can be found in earlier works — for instance, it is also exemplified by Sergeant Dogberry in Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing.)
Injuries to certain parts of the brain can produce aphasia, loss of speech or speech impediment. Damage to Broca's Area can cause a complete inability to form words at all, while damage to Wernicke's Area can produce complete loss of comprehensible speech (the words come out okay but don't mean anything in relation to each other). This is one cause of malapropism. That and liquor. Another very rare condition — proxyglossoriasis — (according to the Duckman television show) has the sufferer replace the intended word with a nearby word in the dictionary. The effect is often hysterical.
Often used by those speaking Poirot Speak. Can also be used to indicate one who is Raised by Wolves, an Alien Speaking English, or else a Cloudcuckoolander, whose sense of reality isn't affected (or effected, as the case may be) by actual reality. May be used to set up an Expospeak Gag.
Compare and contrast with Delusions of Eloquence, Blunt Metaphors Trauma, and My Hovercraft Is Full of Eels. Compare and contrast also with the Spoonerism, where the first letter or syllable is transposed for comedy effect. If the speaker uses the apparently correct words instead but gets hopelessly lost in their train of thought, that's Metaphorgotten. If using the wrong word is the result of mishearing the correct word, that's a Mondegreen. Rouge Angles of Satin is this trope in written form.

t27271,UrbanFantasy,"Urban Fantasy, also sometimes called ""Modern Fantasy"", is a genre that combines common fantasy conventions with a modern setting.note  That is to say, a setting which is significantly more advanced than the Medieval European Fantasy popularized by Tolkien. Around the Enlightenment or Industrial Revolution is sometimes considered the absolute earliest an Urban Fantasy could take place, though it may depend on portrayal. The name ""Urban Fantasy"" is sometimes taken to imply that all works in the genre must take place in a large city, but this is not the case. Rather, the name implies throwing fantasy elements into more modern, urban societies (hence its secondary name). Still, it's very common for Urban Fantasy stories to take place in a large, well-known city, all the easier for their fantasy elements to hide themselves in.
As a genre, Urban Fantasy is sometimes seen as more accessible to the average reader than the Medieval European Fantasy due to the Like Reality Unless Noted nature of it, and the fact that modern settings are familiar to readers whereas the medieval era is something that modern readers may have trouble relating to. The exact cut off date for what falls under Urban Fantasy is fuzzy, as the works which most commonly get this label applied to them feature settings in the present day, but works taking place as far back as the Victorian Era are generally included. Works taking place more than ten to twenty years in the future however, are not.
Urban Fantasies almost always take place on Earth, rather than a Constructed World, or if not on Earth then in a place so close as to make little difference. Alternate History is common, incorporating Fantasy elements into real historical events, with humans living alongside magic, though if this isn't done there is usually a Masquerade, implying that witches, elves and fairies live along side us, just in hiding and probably forming a complete Wainscot Society. In such stories, The Unmasqued World is a common plotline. Another common convention used in Urban Fantasy is to suggest that at one point the world resembled a Medieval European Fantasy but The Magic Goes Away, and in the present The Magic Comes Back and now humans have to adjust to it.
Urban Fantasy often crosses paths with a number of genres, including Alternate History, Cosmic Horror Story, Dungeon Punk, Gothic Punk, Horror, Magical Realism, Paranormal Romance, Paranormal Investigation, Supernatural Fiction and Supernatural Thriller. Sometimes it's difficult to tell whether a work qualifies, but generally speaking Urban Fantasy is known for showing the impact of modern society on the fantasy elements included in it. Elves carry guns, witches use microwaves and Leprechauns work at the bank. It takes more than tossing in the odd vampire solely for the fear-factor to truly apply.
Or, more cynically, a work is Urban Fantasy if it has a half-naked woman on the cover, and Paranormal Romance if it has a half-naked man on the cover.
Gaslamp Fantasy, Supernatural Soap Opera and Historical Fantasy are notable sub genres. Urban Fantasy is itself a subgenre of Speculative Fiction, specifically Fantasy. Many works that throw mystery-genre elements into the mix also rate as Fantastic Noir. Most of the Vampire Fiction published in recent times falls under this genre, whereas in the past it followed the conventions of Horror. Urban Fantasy is often considered the fantasy equivalent of 20 Minutes into the Future.

t27277,OurGiantsAreDifferent,"Legendary creatures that resemble human beings, but super-sized and often incredibly strong. Giants have been around since the times of ancient mythology. In various mythologies, gigantic peoples are featured as primeval creatures associated with chaos and the wild, and they are frequently in conflict with the gods, be they Olympian or Norse. These creatures may range in size from around 7 feet (the average size of the tallest Real Life humans), to truly colossal proportions.
The stereotypical giant is a big, dumb brute who grinds people's bones to make his bread and may serve as the Dumb Muscle for a more intelligent Evil Overlord. But literal gentle giants are also featured in both legends and modern stories, and some giants, both good and evil, may be smarter than they are initially perceived.
In Real Life, the profusion of Giants in mythology is usually attributed to memories of childhood, when adults tower over you, and also the rivalry between young men and old men. It may also be partially related to people finding the bones of massive animals (especially elephants or extinct animals like sauropod dinosaurs and giant ground sloths) and mistaking them for the bones of giant humanoids.
This is Older Than Feudalism. Not to be confused with The Giant, who may be a big wrestler, but isn't nearly that big. See also Smash Mook, Giant Mook, Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever, and Giant Woman (where the giant is specifically a giantess).
Really huge giants, in any real-world context, would fall victim to the Square-Cube Law in short order, but the vast majority of such beings tend to exist in fantasy universes that cheerfully disregard such things as the laws of physics in favor of creating a good story."
t27331,TheyLookLikeEveryoneElse,"This is when a villain doesn't look like a villain and is even more terrifying because of it. This does not apply to particularly handsome or charming villains - that goes under Evil Is Sexy, Beauty Is Bad or Face of an Angel, Mind of a Demon. Characters following this trope look completely ordinary. You could pass them on the street and never notice them, let alone suspect they murdered someone just the other day.
In fantasy and science fiction shows, this is often what makes Mundanger villains so terrifying. While the normal beasties the protagonists hunt down and slay are obviously fantastic monsters that don't exist in our world, these monsters could be living right next door.
Please note: the identity of many of these villains may be part of a reveal, so please use spoilers wisely.
An Enfant Terrible is usually one of these. Contrast Obviously Evil and Devil in Plain Sight, as well as Face of a Thug (when someone is good or well-adjusted despite having a thug face). Compare Manchurian Agent, where they genuinely are like everyone else until triggered. Related with but not to be confused for They Look Like Us Now, where previously inhuman beasties learn to pass for human. The Nondescript is when their ""normalness"" is taken so far that people can't even remember what they're like. May intersect with Ridiculously Average Guy, who looks and acts utterly normal in every respect.
The Trope Namer is a lazy Halloween costume: going in ordinary clothes to a costume party, then claiming, ""I'm a serial killer. They look just like everybody else.""
This is Truth in Television. Who knows? Maybe one of the tropers could just be this."
t27591,SuddenlySpeaking,"So, you have a character who spends most of the time without talking. It can be for whatever reason: they can be a Heroic Mime, they may have lost the ability to speak, or they're just shy. As time goes on...
They finally break the silence.
The Heroic Mime finally gets a line, The Speechless got their voice restored, the meek one finally got the courage to speak up, or someone finally breaks their vow of silence.
The trope can be lighthearted if done for a main character, or ominous if coming from a villain.
Compare Baby's First Words. See also The Silent Bob, a character who rarely speaks, but when he does, it's something profound, and this trope comes into play.
Not to be confused with Suddenly Voiced, which is a character who can talk finally gets a voice behind their words."
t27746,BrutallyHonest,"Since everybody in TV land spends all day desperately lying their way out of situations, one of the more reliable gags is to create a situation where you'd imagine the characters would lie, and have them be perfectly honest and straightforward instead. Sometimes this can separate a polite person from an impolite person, since a brutally honest character may say exactly what's on their mind. A hallmark of the Caustic Critic, or of a child who doesn't really know how to mince words yet.
A common twist on this is when the characters are brutally honest, but then their honesty is not believed. Sometimes, this is deliberate.
Another common twist is for a character to promise brutal honesty before saying something kind.
A form of Bait-and-Switch. Often employed in ""The Reason You Suck"" Speech. A Blunt ""Yes"" typically is an expression of this. Armor-Piercing Response may use this. If a character is brutally honest about why they don't want to do something, they're Not Even Bothering with an Excuse. If the character is just brutal regardless of honesty, they're most likely your garden-variety Jerkass.
Another variation has Charlie being perfectly sincere and asking ""Have I ever lied to you?"" Joe will then list every instance where Charlie has lied out of his proverbial butt, often citing many examples. Little wonder Joe doesn't believe him. It seems Charlie is quite an accomplished and imaginative fibber."
t27763,StrawAtheist,"Atheists in real life are a rather diverse group. After all, the only thing confirmed by the label ""atheist"" is that the person doesn't believe in gods. It's like trying to make a coherent generalization about people who don't like baseball.

In fiction, however, while it is reasonably common to see a character who is never shown practicing or even mentioning religion, it's generally only characters with a fair degree of cynicism and bitterness who will state outright that they are an atheist. Some of the more common character traits are:
Common to all portrayals of the Hollywood Atheist is the idea that faith is the natural state and something must occur to drive the character away from the norm. Given that the majority of humans worldwide are religious (to varying degrees), this understandably colors media greatly, but still, it's always 'my reason for not believing is X.' One never hears 'I just don't have a reason to believe', which is a common (if not the most common) real-life reason given by atheists. The ""Problem of Evil"" (why would a good God create evil or suffering?) is an age-old question that has perplexed scholars of religion precisely because scholars of religion want to believe. For an atheist who doesn't have reason to believe, the ""Problem of Evil"" isn't very relevant. However, other atheists will use this as an argument against belief in God.
See also Acceptable Religious Targets. A major exception is science fiction, which often goes so far the other way as to state that Religion Is Wrong and humanity has Outgrown Such Silly Superstitions. For atheists living in fantasy settings where the existence of gods is irrefutable, see Flat-Earth Atheist (who stubbornly disbelieves in the factuality of God/gods) and Nay-Theist (who accepts the factuality of God/gods, but refuses to worship Him/them).
As with other strawman tropes, Hollywood Atheism is a caricature of Real Life attitudes crafted to suit the purposes of various authors; by definition, real atheists are not examples. The fact that there unfortunately are a Vocal Minority of atheists in Real Life who exhibit these characteristics does not mean that you should assume that those characteristics apply to any atheist you meet.
Compare with Holier Than Thou, and see Crisis of Faith. See also Useful Notes on Atheism. Not to be confused with some of the American conservative movement's more vocal members' view of Hollywood's ""war on Faith"".
The complete opposite trope is ""Belief Makes You Stupid""."
t28281,FirstGuyWins,"In romantic works, the first girl introduced — either overall or as a potential Love Interest — has a very good chance of ending up with the protagonist (especially if the protagonist is male).
There are all sorts of explanations as to why this is. Things ending up the same place they started is a very old narrative technique. The First Girl ""winning"" has a Because Destiny Says So kind of appeal — she metaphorically ""called dibs"" on The Protagonist and tied a string to his heart. This might actually strike a chord with readers because of its Truth in Television overtones; psychological studies suggest that the first people someone meets in a new or unfamiliar social situation have a greater chance at becoming their close friends later on.
From a Doylist point of view, the Law of Conservation of Detail suggests introducing the Love Interest early. An early introduction allows you to get the audience interested in her and rooting for her, gives you space for Character Development, and give her relationship with her (eventual) partner the most time to develop organically. And conversely, the later in the story the Love Interest gets introduced, the harder it'll be to convince the audience to accept them in the role. Characters introduced earlier (be they a Romantic False Lead or even a character that was never intended as a romantic contender at all) will often pick up fan followings who root for them to ""win"", and it's not easy to convince those fans to abandon their initial preference in favor of the Official Couple.
And with all that said, it's such a common device that in all likelihood, it sometimes gets played for its own sake. It telegraphs, ""Lookie here, serious contender for Love Interest."" From this perspective, it's not so much that the First Girl wins because she comes first; rather, she comes first because she's going to win.
As weird as it may sound, sometimes it isn't that obvious which girl is the First. Is it the first girl the protagonist meets according to In-Universe chronology, even if we first see her halfway through the show's run? The first one to show romantic feelings? The first new girl the protagonist meets? If we have different adaptations, by which of them are we going? If you're suspecting some girl is supposed to be the First Girl, a good idea would be to take a look at how the writer has played her up. Is she a major character? Is her ""first"" interaction led up to, emphasized, treated as a big deal? All other things being equal, is she a strong contender for being the protagonist's Love Interest? These things may be the difference between the First Girl and a girl who happened to be first. Most writers will take care to put some effort into building a would-be triumphant First Girl as a romantic option in her own right, so as to avoid Strangled by the Red String.
The First Girl will rarely be the first one to confess her feelings, admit them, or sometimes even develop them. In fact, she's much likelier to be the one who does it last — maybe near the end of the series when she and the main character become the Official Couple. The logic behind this is that she's the one who the main character loves (even if he doesn't want to admit it or doesn't realize it himself); if she showed him romantic affection, then he would immediately choose her. That's tantamount to throwing the Romance Arc (or in some genres, the whole plot) out the window, and we can't have that.
Of course, a writer can't outright admit that's what they're doing, which is why you can expect an in-universe justification for how these two people met so early and took so long to figure out they belong together. Their first impression of each other may be immense dislike or possibly indifference. Complications will abound, Romantic False Leads will show up, misunderstandings will arise between them, pride and denial will keep them apart. In extreme cases, it may turn out her apparent lack of interest in him was a major turn-on. Paradoxically enough, nothing screams ""major romance incoming"" like this sort of thing. A more subtle tactic is to get the First Girl ""off the radar"" somehow — Demoted to Extra, Put on a Bus and similar tactics—but this adds the additional challenge of bringing her out of exile in a believable way.
Inevitably, most shippers will already have their own idea of who the ""right"" girl is, so if she might conceivably have any sort of claim to being the First Girl they will gleefully reach out to put this feather in their Ship's cap. Given the above ambiguity of what exactly it means for a girl to be the ""First"", it's not a surprise that the question of which girl was first tends to become yet another front of Ship-to-Ship Combat.
Be warned before you proceed. ""Winning"", in this sense, tends to be very spoileriffic.
See also Victorious Childhood Friend and First Girl After All. Contrast Second Love and Last Girl Wins.
Be wary of adding Beta Couple examples. Their lack of screen-time means the ""introduce the relationship early to get space for development"" consideration becomes crucial, and as a result meeting ""first"" is all but a staple of the Beta Couple. They will sometimes have obvious C-List Fodder Romantic False Leads in orbit that we're not supposed to take seriously, but that's pretty much it. For those, list aversions, or instances where more than one possible relationship involving a cast regular gets seriously played up but the ""first"" one ends up winning anyway."
t28332,CyberneticsWillEatYourSoul,"In many popular cyberpunk Tabletop Games, cybernetic implants cause ""humanity loss"", reducing your social traits and essentially making cyberware into a form of Body Horror. Too many implants may reduce your character to catatonia or (far more often) Ax-Crazy on steroids. If these settings also feature Psychic Powers or Functional Magic, cyberware often reduces your ability to use those as well. This trope usually accompanies the broken lesson that only cyberware inflicts humanity loss — sure, getting that Arm Cannon will dehumanize you, but not deliberately committing actual atrocities, getting hooked on hard drugs, learning Black Magic, having a mental illness that is not fictional, or other expected sources of insanity. It is also a Broken Aesop when Ridiculously Human Robots are depicted as more... um... human.
It does of course make a huge logical difference whether it is just limbs and other body parts being replaced, or if sections of the brain itself are being replaced with equipment which may perform inferiorly to, or merely differently from the original. Replacing parts of your uniquely balanced glandular/hormonal system with pumps might not do your personality any favors, either. Characters who are getting encased in a mobile life support coffin usually suffer this not from having parts replaced, but being put in large, scary and clumsy or destructive bodies.
This trope can be considered a form of Competitive Balance gone bad, as game designers originally used humanity loss to keep player cyborgs in line — without any drawbacks, any Munchkin worth his salt would load himself down with Kill-O-Matic 3000s slaved to his neural systems so he could kill with a thought while his brand new shiny titanium limbs ripped battleships in half. In practice, this wasn't a good balancing mechanism; to a true Munchkin, having your character become a drooling Ax-Crazy psychopath only made it easier to justify all that senseless carnage. It's also notable that this trope happened in few (if any) of the original Cyber Punk novels that inspired most of these games.
Of course, if the cyborg was dead prior to the cybernetics being installed, and it is mentioned that parts being reactivated have side-effects or don't work like the original, this is a case of Came Back Wrong.
In works of fiction, the ""humanity loss"" is often shown by the character turning evil, becoming emotionless or ""hollow"", or possibly even losing their memories.
Compare with Magic Versus Science, Science Is Bad, Pro-Human Transhuman and The Mind Is a Plaything of the Body. See also Psycho Serum, Body Horror, Transhuman Treachery and Our Souls Are Different. If the ""humanity loss"" from cybernetics is seen as something desirable, see Machine Worship. See also Creative Sterility."
t28470,GrizzledVeteran,"The old soldier is the grizzled veteran who has been through and seen everything in war. He would more than qualify for being a Shell-Shocked Veteran, both in age and experience, but he's still going into battle and odds are that he's the backbone of whatever unit he or (more rarely) she is in. This character type is almost never an officer or a commander, and is instead usually a Sergeant Rock. If he is an officer, expect a Four-Star Badass. Generally you can expect them to be tough, to have a few badass scars, and to be eternally pissed off at (or at least exasperated by) the younger troops around him. Despite that, he may still turn out to be one of the best sources of mentoring or seasoning a young soldier can get. Some might be too much used to military life to effectively function in the civilian life.
Expect the Officer and a Gentleman to rely on him quite a bit in running the unit, a la Captain Smooth and Sergeant Rough. Ensign Newbie, on the other hand, will rarely know to do this or will actively tick off the old soldier in attempting to control a unit, a mistake he usually pays for. Despite the first page quote, old soldiers have about a 50-50 chance of dying in a work of fiction, but usually not until rather late in the story, generally in a Heroic Sacrifice of some kind or in a suitably impressive way. If this character dies early in a story, odds are you're dealing with a story on the cynical end of the scale, and that it's going to have a high mortality rate.
If the soldier is too old to fight, or too battered (or both), but denies that fact, he may be a Perilous Old Fool."
t28573,GrandDame,"The Grande Dame is the stately older woman — usually of wealth and rank, though often enough only wishing to appear so — who is very often a large woman of ample physique, uptight, humorless, and the butt of jokes. The Grande Dame is usually a spinster or widow, in which case she is likely to become an Old Maid or an Abhorrent Admirer; if she is married, it will usually be to a Henpecked Husband (very often an Uncle Pennybags), whom she will drag to operas (where she will also look down on people who wear the wrong style of High Class Gloves) and ballets because Men Are Uncultured, though she will more often be a patroness of the arts than The Prima Donna herself. She will also quite often have some sort of spoilt and pampered (and very often overweight) child or pet, a Persian or a Pomeranian or a parrot, on whom the rest of her dependents must dance attendance. In most cases, any attempt at frivolity will draw from her either a frigid stare of disapproval or sheer, blank incomprehension. Nevertheless, she will occasionally turn out to be a sympathetic character as well — very occasionally she will turn out to have a screwball or eccentric streak herself.
As she sinks down toward the cynical end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism, she will on uncommon occasions become a Deadpan Snarker, though if she goes too far, she may turn into the Rich Bitch; as she rises toward the idealistic end, she may become the more friendly Maiden Aunt — in very rare cases (like Ellen O'Hara) she may become the saintly ""great lady"". Both extremes are uncommon, however, as in general she preserves the status quo as a Moral Guardian — she may well have started out as an Apron Matron — and her watchword is ""Respectability."" If she loses this and begins to hit the bottle, there is a good chance she will turn into Lady Drunk.
The trope is nearly always a Comedy Trope, associated particularly with the Comedy of Manners; as such, it serves as a useful device for mocking social pretensions, and dates back to the ancient Roman plays of Plautus and Terence, where the Grande Dame appeared as the Matrona. She was not used much in the uninhibited Middle Ages, but made a comeback as the humorless, self-important dueña of the 16th and 17th century Spanish theater (Small Name, Big Ego Doña Rodríguez is the only one character stupid enough in all the novel to believe that Don Quixote is a real Knight Errant). The prude and bluestocking of the Restoration (such as Molière's Arsinoé and his Précieuses ridicules) and Sentimental comedies (for instance, Mrs. Malaprop in Sheridan's The Rivals) also have some affinities with the type, insofar as they made pretensions to virtue and culture.
However, it was only with the Victorian age that the great era of the Grande Dame opened. Here, with her fur stole and her ancestral lorgnette in hand, the Grande Dame quashed social climbers, sought advantageous marriages for her daughters and repelled impossible matches for her sons, and maintained the natural order of Society with frigid hauteur for a good hundred years and more. In England, she was generally in Debrett and was called ""Lady"" something if she didn't have some title or other (""Countess"" was particularly imposing); in the US, she was one of the Brahmins or the Four Hundred or the FFV and was called ""Mrs. Van"" Whoozis or Miss Firstname. She will still turn up occasionally, to preside over banquets and to be aghast at the excesses of Feminism or the Youth movement and to wonder why no young ladies bother to go to the cotillion any more.
Her plot function will usually be as an obstruction to the plans of the protagonist, though she will occasionally convert to his side — more rarely, she may assist from the first.
Grandes Dames do not have to be useless, of course. A Grande Dame can be a noblewoman or tribal elder and act as a Seer, an Iron Lady, or The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask stoutly and cunningly defending her domain. Sometimes she's simply an aged Proper Lady."
t28656,NonStandardGameOver,"In most games, players see the dreaded Game Over screen when they lose in some way. Maybe you fell down too many Bottomless Pits and lost all your lives, or the Player Character was beaten to death by a particularly vicious Demonic Spider. Maybe you failed a story important mission or lost a critical Non-Player Character during an Escort Mission. You might have been caught or captured during a Stealth-Based Mission. ...Or, maybe you just forgot to pause the game while reading the walkthrough you pulled from GameFAQs and the game's timer ran out — you get the idea. These are all standard failings, usually treated with a simple, default message: ""Game Over.""
Alternatively, you have successfully finished the game, defeated the Final Boss and receive a Game Over message after the credits because technically the ""game is over"". But that is not what this trope is about.
Sometimes there are games that give an unusual message or even a full cutscene for losing the game in a specific way. These are non-standard Game Overs.
There are a few variations on this theme:
This page is about the unusual, context-sensitive methods by which players trigger a Game Over screen. It doesn't include the times when the game tries to trick you into thinking that the game has ended.
For games where every death is accompanied by a special message, see Have a Nice Death. For games where every death has a special animation, see The Many Deaths of You. For games where all bad endings contain extended narrations or demonstrations about the consequences of your actions, see It's a Wonderful Failure.
For standard Game Overs that result from an instant-kill attack, see One-Hit Kill. For the game ending early due to a non-standard victory condition, see Instant-Win Condition. If a non-standard Game Over cuts the game's ending, then it's aptly No Ending. For non-standard Game Overs triggered early in the game, see Press Start to Game Over. For situations where there's an achievement awarded for this, see Achievement Mockery."
t28705,MexicanStandOff,"A stalemate where everyone has a weaponnote Usually, but not always, a gun or other firearm pointed at someone else. All the threats are equally balanced to ensure a Mutual Disadvantage; no one is walking away from this standoff with what they came for.
This trope can be constructed in a number of geometries: one against one, three or more to a side, free-for-all, or army against army. Frequently ends in a Blast Out when someone gets twitchy, figures the odds differently than everyone else and decides they have an advantage, or is just crazy enough to not care if they die too. Entry of a third party can also end things, since those already there are fixated on each other.
When this kind of standoff happens in Heroic Bloodshed movies, it usually takes the form of two characters with their guns in each other's faces at point blank range. Another version of the Mexican Standoff has three or more participants with guns leveled in ring-around-the-rosy fashion, so the person you've got covered is not the one covering you. Blades could be substituted for guns, meaning the person you've got covered just might survive long enough to retaliate.
Sometimes the situation is resolved in a civilized fashion with all involved parties realizing the suicidal position they are in and agreeing to put down their weapons, usually on a count of three to make sure no one ambushes the other. Occasionally, a downplayed Friend or Foe situation results in a brief version of this
It's Older Than Radio and has been around long enough to be parodied in the play ""The Critic"", first staged in 1779. The term itself, however, originated in the 19th century - possibly in Australia, of all places - regarding perceived political indecision in Mexico.
Unsurprisingly, Mexicans don't refer to this as a Mexican standoff. In fact, no quippy Spanish equivalent seems to exist at all.
When entire nations do this, it's upscaled to Mutually Assured Destruction. Also a case of the famous ""Prisoner's Dilemma"": If everyone puts the gun down, everyone lives. If everyone shoots, everyone will die. But nobody wants to be the first to put the gun down and become vulnerable. Compare the Showdown at High Noon from Westerns which sometimes take the form of this trope. It's also closely related to the Game of Chicken, where nobody wants to be the first to back down, but if nobody backs down, well....
Expect Extreme Close-Ups.
Not to be confused with Mexican rugby fly-halves. That is a stand-off that happens to be Mexican."
t28820,FairplayWhodunnit,"The opposite of a Clueless Mystery; the puzzle of the story is entirely solvable before The Reveal or The Summation, if you've spotted the clues, and not just by various methods as a reader/viewer. The trick, of course, is having it solvable by the reader/viewer, but still difficult enough that they don't all figure it out long before the actual reveal. To avoid the reader/viewer feeling guilt about enjoying the investigation of a murder, and to avoid disturbingly intense emotion among the characters, the victim is often someone who the reader and the in-universe characters don't particularly mourn.
In 1928, the writer Father Ronald Knox created a ""Ten Commandments"" of plot devices (Knox's Decalogue) that more or less codified the rules of the Fair-play whodunnit:
Though increasingly rare in modern mystery literature and non-print media, in the ""Golden Age"" of mystery, novels were almost entirely of this type, though even then some were better about the ""fair"" part than others. This trend is kept alive largely through its incorporation in ""Dinner Theater"", where a short mystery play is acted out while the patrons eat, and the audience is invited to solve it before the answer is played out.
Done badly, this can lead to Conviction by Contradiction. Done correctly, and it turns into what Golden Age writer John Dickson Carr called ""The Grandest Game in the World."""
t28962,LongRunningBookSeries,"There are some book series that just seem to go on forever. They create epic journeys and worlds that feel almost three-dimensional. They take up entire shelves of book cases all by themselves. These are some of the largest and longest running series in the literary world.
In order to count as one of these a series must meet all of the following conditions:
A subtrope of Print Long-Runners."
t29374,LitFic,"Lit Fic (short for “Literary Fiction”) is a nebulous, broad term which emerged during the 1960s. Though it is usually contrasted with Genre Fiction (“Speculative Fiction”, Mystery Fiction, Romance Novel, and so on), there’s more to it than “any non-genre fiction”; in some respects, it is a genre unto itself, characterized by an aspiration to literary merit and a greater focus on style, theme and psychological depth—as opposed to the focus on plot and narrative typical of genre fiction.
From this you might infer that this is typically not the kind of work that provides one’s daily fix of vampire-hunting, magically-transforming, banana-bending, mecha-piloting, super-powered, time-travelling teenagers beating the odds. A touch of Magical Realism might be allowed, but never to the point where it becomes the focus of the story. Rather, a piece of Lit Fic is much likelier to be about everyday people doing everyday things, dealing with everyday problems and eventually coming to realizations or personal transformations. A family struggles with cancer. A man struggles with death. A couple struggles with alcoholism. A child struggles to become an adult. Literary fiction is therefore sometimes criticized as “100,000 words in which nothing happens.” Interestingly, this gives it much overlap with what is called Slice of Life fiction, which is similarly about people going on with their daily lives (although Slice of Life is in a very general sense perceived to be more lighthearted).
There is very little escapism or Wish Fulfillment in Lit Fic. For some readers, this induces an instinctive aversion to the genre; they deem it pretentious and boring, an over-application of “write what you know” that is mainly capable of generating tales of middle-aged English professors contemplating adultery. For other readers, the contrast between the realism and the conventions of genre fiction is refreshing and makes stories more relatable. Lit Fic, more than any other genre, invests itself in real-life situations and real-life people. This is, generally, a good investment; in the end, even in the wackiest and most speculative adventures, the touch of real life—characters and their believable faults and struggles—is what ties everything together, carries the Willing Suspension of Disbelief and keeps the Eight Deadly Words at bay.
Ostensibly for this reason, Lit fic has a reputation as the “mainstream” of fiction. It does not have the greatest market share and is overall not the most popular, but it aims at the center of mass of what storytelling is about, and as a result if a work of fiction is called a “classic”, most of the time it’s a piece of Lit Fic. It’s worth noting that the genre really only began to appear towards the end of the 19th century, when the corresponding genre fictions began to crystallize. (One could argue that most works of fiction before the emergence of genre fic are essentially lit fic, but the term is generally used to refer to contemporary works.)
Much like other things in life, the division between literary fiction and genre fiction is not a total binary dichotomy. The typical struggles of people just trying to find their place in the world comprise one aspect of storytelling; the speculation on what the world would be like if only it were slightly more fantastic is another aspect of storytelling. Various works will emphasize these two aspects to varying degrees, and as a result, sometimes the line between the two genres becomes blurred. To top it off, it is worth keeping in mind that works from both genres will often defy expectation and act wildly out of the stereotype expected of them. Some works dealing with “ordinary situations and ordinary people” will make you cry with laughter. Some works dealing with spaceship politics on the planet Xyrrzquilon VI will introduce situations that hit close to home and will make you pause and really think about your own life, and where it is going. And works in some established genres get Out of the Ghetto quite often—the more serious sort of Spy Fiction is especially prone to this, since its subject matter lends itself to explorations of morality, power, and the nuances of man's psychenote Graham Greene and John le Carré are major examples of this. Publishers often use the term ""upmarket fiction"" to describe works that combine aspects of literary fiction and genre fiction."
t29575,YoungAdultLiterature,"Young Adult fiction (and, more rarely, nonfiction) is a publishing term for books aimed at readers approximately 15 to 25 years old (though some authorities put the upper range at closer to 34). It uses a slightly simpler vocabulary and does not assume certain experiences on the part of the reader. Currently, Young Adult is mostly a marketing concept and thus YA novels are well represented in both literary and genre fiction. Generally, YA fiction features a child or teenage protagonist (although not always), usually in a Coming-of-Age Story. A common staple of YA fiction is the ""problem novel"", in which some sort of societal issue (such as sexuality, mental illness, poverty, racism, etc.) is discussed. Since all of this is also likely to appeal to adults, it is often separately marketed to both demographics. Young Adult fiction can feature content deemed unsuitable for children, but also will often have didactic and moralistic content.
The rough television equivalent is the Teen Drama (or Kid Com, though depending on the network usually aimed at a younger age group). The rough manga and anime equivalents are Shonen and Shoujo. The term ""Young Adult"" however has begun to be used widely as an umbrella term.
Due to a general misunderstanding of the term, and the fact that many of its target demographic are actually over the age of 18, nearly every venue in which Young Adult (or its synonym) storytelling occurs is subject to some degree of What Do You Mean, It's Not for Kids?, especially in works that are sexually explicit, very violent, or contain so-called ""mature"" subject matter that parents may feel is inappropriate for kids or teenagers. This is one reason why YA novels regularly face censorship and banning challenges.
Also see Middle Grade Literature and Children's Literature, for the next age groups down.
While Light Novels are directed at young adult audiences too, they are on their own index for convenience.
For the 2011 movie, see Young Adult."
t29994,OlderThanFeudalism,"All of The Oldest Ones in the Book first recorded after the invention of the Greek alphabet (c. 800 BC) and before the fall of Ancient Rome in the 5th century (c. 476 AD), a period usually called Classical antiquity. Works from this period include:
Note: Tropes originating in other mythologies/religions are not indexed here, as we have no idea whether those stories even existed by the 5th century AD, or what forms they took, centuries before they were first written down. Even Norse and Celtic mythology are only Older Than Print; although they're derived at least in part from earlier (unwritten) stories, the details are fundamentally un-dateable. Early folklorists often started with the assumption that folktales and myths never changed; more research has shown that people can and do modify all sorts of tales for many purposes."
t30000,Redshirts,"This is the Good Counterpart of Evil Minions and Mooks — set filler for our heroes' side. Their purpose is almost exclusively to give the writers someone to kill who isn't a main character, although they can also serve as Spear Carriers. In a series where The Main Characters Do Everything, if you suddenly see someone else who you've never seen before involved in the main story, they are probably Redshirts.
They are used to show how the monster works, and demonstrate that it is indeed a deadly menace, without having to lose anyone important. Expect someone to say ""He's Dead, Jim"", lament this ""valued crew member's senseless death"", and then promptly forget him. Security personnel in general fall victim to the worst shade of this trope, as most of the time their deaths aren't even acknowledged at all; according to Hollywood, you could walk into a bank and shoot a security guard right in the face without anyone making a fuss. If you shot anyone else afterward, the headline would just read ""Bank Customers Killed"".
Please note: this Trope is actually very inaccurate when you compare it to Real Life. If you were to watch every episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, count the number of casualties that the Enterprise had, and then compare that to an actual military, you'd see that Kirk's record as a leader in this regard is excellent, far better than any general in U.S. history. Even war heroes like George Washington and Dwight D. Eisenhower had proportionately more casualties among their troops.note It has been suggested that it would be more appropriate to compare Kirk's casualty rate to units on exploratory, rather than combat, missions. It must be remembered that the Enterprise under Kirk's command participated in multiple combat missions against warships with superior weaponry (such as in the episodes ""Balance of Terror"" and ""The Doomsday Machine"" to name a few). 
Also note that while this trope was true in a strictly numerical sense for the original Star Trek series (25 crew member died with red shirts on, 10 with gold, and 8 with blue), it is not true in terms of the percentage of red shirts shown. In percentages to total crew, 10 percent of red shirts died, against 18 percent of gold shirts.
In mass quantities, they make up the Red Shirt Army. Frequently overlaps with Men Are the Expendable Gender and Black Dude Dies First.
Compare to The Worf Effect (a strong character is defeated to show the enemy's strength), Sacrificial Lion (a strong and important character is killed to show the enemy's strength or seriousness), The World's Expert on Getting Killed, Retirony, Mauve Shirt, Sacrificial Lamb, Disposable Sex Worker, Anyone Can Die, Little Dead Riding Hood, C-List Fodder, A Million Is a Statistic, and Monster Munch.
Contrast Plot Armor and Red Herring Shirt.
For John Scalzi's novel Redshirts, which deconstructs this trope, go to Literature.Redshirts, and for the sci-fi social networking simulator, go to VideoGame.Redshirt.
Has nothing to do with the guerrilla army of Italian nationalist leader Giuseppe Garibaldi."
t30220,Bioaugmentation,"The biological counterpart to Cyborging: instead of altering humans to add machine parts, the geeks in the lab-coats change the flesh, blood and DNA.
Genetic Engineering and stem cell research opens new avenues in the way science and Sci-Fi writers can create modified humans to suit any environment. You could think of them as artificially created Mutants, but ""artificially created"" is the key to the definition. And we mean created on purpose, not by freak accident like being bombarded with gamma radiation or other exposure to Green Rocks.
On the mild end, this can entail things that, if current medical science keeps trending the way it does in Real Life, may not sound all that fantastic in a few decades: limb grafts, biological prosthetics and less visible gene mod enhancements that make people smarter, stronger and better at stuff. Further down the fantastic scale you start to get genetic superpowers, quick and easy drastic cosmetic changes from plastic surgery on up (want green skin and spots? No problem!), extra limbs and stuff that makes humans look a lot more like aliens than most Human Aliens.
Can be combined with Cyborging for even more body mod fun. Certain types of Functional Magic may accomplish the same thing but many or most of them are better listed under Mix And Match Creature or Hybrid Monster, and of those remaining, should be looked at with Clarke's Third Law in mind. Is a newer trope than cyborging because Genetic Engineering Is the New Nuke (and shares some but not all examples with it). Also see Organic Technology, LEGO Genetics, Magic Genetics, Superpowerful Genetics, Mix-and-Match Critters, Art Major Biology, Designer Babies, Bio Punk, and its Super-Trope, Transhuman. Can overlap with the Stock Superpower of Biomanipulation."
t30286,XenoFiction,"A few works of Science Fiction and Fantasy (and, in some cases even realistic fiction) take the Point of View of normal animals, Intellectual Animals, Intelligent Gerbils, or Starfish Aliens. More than that, the creators of such stories take great pains to think through what it would actually be like to be a rabbit, a dolphin, or a giant betentacled being who smells colour.
A good rule of thumb for figuring out if something is in this genre or not: if you can replace the non-humans with (maybe superpowered) humans without too much trouble, it's probably not Xenofiction: Beast Fables and works about Funny Animals are, in general, not examples. Likewise in many a Mouse World, size is often the only major difference between humans and non-humans; however, there is Xenofiction featuring non-humans with great differences in size.
If it's taking place under the nose of humans, there may or may not have a Masquerade, and humans will probably either be bastards or eldritch abominations. If humans are taking place under the nose of it, you may have Humans Are Interesting. Xenofiction usually explores Bizarre Alien Psychology.
This is also common in fanfics of Mon series where the mon is the POV character.
See Xenofictional Literature for an index of Xenofiction.
Contrast Most Writers Are Human. Compare to Narrative-Driven Nature Documentary for nature documentaries that anthropomorphise the animals.
Not to be confused with Xenafication, or the Xeno games."
t30470,RecountedByTheMainCharacters,"Sometimes, ""this is a true story"" is part of the fiction.
Once in a while a really well written story can feel so real that you begin to wonder if it might not be based on a true story. Occasionally this is actually the case, or supposedly so, but there are times when an author (etc) will go right out of their way to create greater immersion in their work by claiming that their very obviously fictional and fantastic world is in some way real. Usually they claim that they didn't come up with the story, rather it was recounted to them by the actual main characters (or some other witness), often physically, but sometimes by phone or magic. Other times they will claim that they found the account in the form of a diary and novelised it, or, if it is a film, that it comprises found footage or a mixture of found footage and Dramatisation.
Another common method is to claim that the book was written as a testimony (or confession) to actual events - possibly the most notable example of this is The Guild of Specialists trilogy, which takes the love that boys' annuals have for intricate diagrams and maps to its absolute extreme and fabricates not only a plethora of large diagrams, maps, and sketches, but photos and objects. In this version the author pretends they are simply publishing something that someone else has written - this often takes the form of a novelization of a diary or a set of notebooks. Other methods include accounts by secondary characters and so on. This trope, a staple of children's books and fantastic tales, often features an Author Avatar or even instances of From Beyond the Fourth Wall or other strangeness and may be said to be translated from accounts of what happened or books written by the characters and never actually communicated in person.
In all these cases, however, it is considered canon that the author is repeating a story that is in fact true, if only to a certain degree. One of the people the story is about may even be the author themselves.
Compare ...And That Little Girl Was Me, and Based on a Great Big Lie.
Absolutely not to be confused with Literary Agent Hypothesis, when fans think that maybe the story is actually real, or like to think it is, but don't have any support from canon or Word of God. Also not to be confused with A True Story in My Universe, for In-Universe examples. Often ties in with Author Avatar and may involve an admitted Unreliable Narrator.
Note: This trope only applies to canon and Word of God examples in fictional works. In-Universe examples go in A True Story in My Universe. Pure Fanon examples go in Literary Agent Hypothesis."
t30487,DarkSkinnedRedHead,"Like most character design decisions in anime, colors are often chosen to reflect personalities more than to be realistic depictions. Although dark skin is not a particularly alien choice, it's more often used to reflect a bouncy, energetic, fiery personality than actual nationality. This probably has roots back to the ideal of Japanese beauty including pale skin, as opposed to the chain of association with tanned people being outdoorsy, and thus lively and adventurous. Add in Western associations with red hair, and you get a boisterous adventure-seeker. Bonus points if they have gold eyes.
Naturally, this includes Hard Drinking Party Girls and Tricksters of both genders. The most common combination with this skin tone is a vibrant and noticeable light color. Red is very popular, associated with all sorts of playful Japanese spirits as well as the kabuki wig, so it's also a common (and deliberately unusual looking) palette choice for demons and Cat Girls. Red's a popular hair color for other reasons as well, of course.
Note, dark skinned characters with dark hair (olive, purple, black) tend to have muted personalities.
This trope can be Truth in Television thanks to dye; notably, in Asian countries like Pakistan, dyeing hair red with henna dye is common. (Natural redheads in Pakistan — and there are many — usually have light skin.) Dark skin with natural red hair is often seen in Oceania, especially Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea. In other places, you generally only see natural red hair in cases of Mixed Ancestry. For example, the Afro-American activist Malcolm X earned the nickname ""Detroit Red"" due to the reddish tinge in his hair that he inherited from a Scottish ancestor. Likewise, basketball player Blake Griffin has tan skin and red hair due to having a black father and white redhead mother.
Sister trope to Dark-Skinned Blond. Contrast Eerie Pale-Skinned Brunette and Raven Hair, Ivory Skin. Also quite likely to be Ambiguously Brown. But sometimes. You Gotta Have Blue Hair."
