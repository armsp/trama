The Bear Came Over the Mountain,Alice Munro,"Fiona lived in her parents’ house, in the town where she and Grant went to university. It was a big, bay-windowed house that seemed to Grant both luxurious and disorderly, with rugs crooked on the floors and cup rings bitten into the table varnish. Her mother was Icelandic—a powerful woman with a froth of white hair and indignant far-left politics. The father was an important cardiologist, revered around the hospital but happily subservient at home, where he would listen to his wife’s strange tirades with an absentminded smile. Fiona had her own little car and a pile of cashmere sweaters, but she wasn’t in a sorority, and her mother’s political activity was probably the reason. Not that she cared. Sororities were a joke to her, and so was politics—though she liked to play “The Four Insurgent Generals” on the phonograph, and sometimes also the “Internationale,” very loud, if there was a guest she thought she could make nervous. A curly-haired gloomy-looking foreigner was courting her—she said he was a Visigoth—and so were two or three quite respectable and uneasy young interns. She made fun of them all and of Grant as well. She would drolly repeat some of his small-town phrases. He thought maybe she was joking when she proposed to him, on a cold bright day on the beach at Port Stanley. Sand was stinging their faces and the waves delivered crashing loads of gravel at their feet.

“Do you think it would be fun—” Fiona shouted. “Do you think it would be fun if we got married?”

He took her up on it, he shouted yes. He wanted never to be away from her. She had the spark of life.

Just before they left their house Fiona noticed a mark on the kitchen floor. It came from the cheap black house shoes she had been wearing earlier in the day.

“I thought they’d quit doing that,” she said in a tone of ordinary annoyance and perplexity, rubbing at the gray smear that looked as if it had been made by a greasy crayon.

She remarked that she’d never have to do this again, since she wasn’t taking those shoes with her.

“I guess I’ll be dressed up all the time,” she said. “Or semi-dressed up. It’ll be sort of like in a hotel.”

She rinsed out the rag she’d been using and hung it on the rack inside the door under the sink. Then she put on her golden-brown, fur-collared ski jacket, over a white turtleneck sweater and tailored fawn slacks. She was a tall, narrow-shouldered woman, seventy years old but still upright and trim, with long legs and long feet, delicate wrists and ankles, and tiny, almost comical-looking ears. Her hair that was as light as milkweed fluff had gone from pale blond to white somehow without Grant’s noticing exactly when, and she still wore it down to her shoulders, as her mother had done. (That was the thing that had alarmed Grant’s own mother, a small-town widow who worked as a doctor’s receptionist. The long white hair on Fiona’s mother, even more than the state of the house, had told her all she needed to know about attitudes and politics.) But otherwise Fiona, with her fine bones and small sapphire eyes, was nothing like her mother. She had a slightly crooked mouth, which she emphasized now with red lipstick—usually the last thing she did before she left the house.

She looked just like herself on this day—direct and vague as in fact she was, sweet and ironic.

Over a year ago, Grant had started noticing so many little yellow notes stuck up all over the house. That was not entirely new. Fiona had always written things down—the title of a book she’d heard mentioned on the radio or the jobs she wanted to make sure she got done that day. Even her morning schedule was written down. He found it mystifying and touching in its precision: “7 A.M. yoga. 7:30–7:45 teeth face hair. 7:45–8:15 walk. 8:15 Grant and breakfast.”

The new notes were different. Stuck onto the kitchen drawers—Cutlery, Dish-towels, Knives. Couldn’t she just open the drawers and see what was inside?

Worse things were coming. She went to town and phoned Grant from a booth to ask him how to drive home. She went for her usual walk across the field into the woods and came home by the fence line—a very long way round. She said that she’d counted on fences always taking you somewhere.

It was hard to figure out. She’d said that about fences as if it were a joke, and she had remembered the phone number without any trouble.

“I don’t think it’s anything to worry about,” she said. “I expect I’m just losing my mind.”

He asked if she had been taking sleeping pills.

“If I am I don’t remember,” she said. Then she said she was sorry to sound so flippant. “I’m sure I haven’t been taking anything. Maybe I should be. Maybe vitamins.”

Vitamins didn’t help. She would stand in doorways trying to figure out where she was going. She forgot to turn on the burner under the vegetables or put water in the coffeemaker. She asked Grant when they’d moved to this house.

“Was it last year or the year before?”

“It was twelve years ago,” he said.

“That’s shocking.”

“She’s always been a bit like this,” Grant said to the doctor. He tried without success to explain how Fiona’s surprise and apologies now seemed somehow like routine courtesy, not quite concealing a private amusement. As if she’d stumbled on some unexpected adventure. Or begun playing a game that she hoped he would catch on to.

“Yes, well,” the doctor said. “It might be selective at first. We don’t know, do we? Till we see the pattern of the deterioration, we really can’t say.”

In a while it hardly mattered what label was put on it. Fiona, who no longer went shopping alone, disappeared from the supermarket while Grant had his back turned. A policeman picked her up as she was walking down the middle of the road, blocks away. He asked her name and she answered readily. Then he asked her the name of the Prime Minister.

“If you don’t know that, young man, you really shouldn’t be in such a responsible job.”

He laughed. But then she made the mistake of asking if he’d seen Boris and Natasha. These were the now dead Russian wolfhounds she had adopted many years ago, as a favor to a friend, then devoted herself to for the rest of their lives. Her taking them over might have coincided with the discovery that she was not likely to have children. Something about her tubes being blocked, or twisted—Grant could not remember now. He had always avoided thinking about all that female apparatus. Or it might have been after her mother died. The dogs’ long legs and silky hair, their narrow, gentle, intransigent faces made a fine match for her when she took them out for walks. And Grant himself, in those days, landing his first job at the university (his father-in-law’s money welcome there in spite of the political taint), might have seemed to some people to have been picked up on another of Fiona’s eccentric whims, and groomed and tended and favored—though, fortunately, he didn’t understand this until much later.

There was a rule that nobody could be admitted to Meadowlake during the month of December. The holiday season had so many emotional pitfalls. So they made the twenty-minute drive in January. Before they reached the highway the country road dipped through a swampy hollow now completely frozen over.

Fiona said, “Oh, remember.”

Grant said, “I was thinking about that, too.”

“Only it was in the moonlight,” she said.

She was talking about the time that they had gone out skiing at night under the full moon and over the black-striped snow, in this place that you could get into only in the depths of winter. They had heard the branches cracking in the cold.

If she could remember that, so vividly and correctly, could there really be so much the matter with her? It was all he could do not to turn around and drive home.

There was another rule that the supervisor explained to him. New residents were not to be visited during the first thirty days. Most people needed that time to get settled in. Before the rule had been put in place, there had been pleas and tears and tantrums, even from those who had come in willingly. Around the third or fourth day they would start lamenting and begging to be taken home. And some relatives could be susceptible to that, so you would have people being carted home who would not get on there any better than they had before. Six months or sometimes only a few weeks later, the whole upsetting hassle would have to be gone through again.

“Whereas we find,” the supervisor said, “we find that if they’re left on their own the first month they usually end up happy as clams.”

They had in fact gone over to Meadowlake a few times several years ago to visit Mr. Farquhar, the old bachelor farmer who had been their neighbor. He had lived by himself in a drafty brick house unaltered since the early years of the century, except for the addition of a refrigerator and a television set. Now, just as Mr. Farquhar’s house was gone, replaced by a gimcrack sort of castle that was the weekend home of some people from Toronto, the old Meadow-lake was gone, though it had dated only from the fifties. The new building was a spacious, vaulted place, whose air was faintly, pleasantly pine-scented. Profuse and genuine greenery sprouted out of giant crocks in the hallways.

Nevertheless, it was the old Meadowlake that Grant found himself picturing Fiona in, during the long month he had to get through without seeing her. He phoned every day and hoped to get the nurse whose name was Kristy. She seemed a little amused at his constancy, but she would give him a fuller report than any other nurse he got stuck with.

Fiona had caught a cold the first week, she said, but that was not unusual for newcomers. “Like when your kids start school,” Kristy said. “There’s a whole bunch of new germs they’re exposed to and for a while they just catch everything.”

Then the cold got better. She was off the antibiotics and she didn’t seem as confused as she had been when she came in. (This was the first Grant had heard about either the antibiotics or the confusion.) Her appetite was pretty good and she seemed to enjoy sitting in the sunroom. And she was making some friends, Kristy said.

If anybody phoned, he let the machine pick up. The people they saw socially, occasionally, were not close neighbors but people who lived around the country, who were retired, as they were, and who often went away without notice. They would imagine that he and Fiona were away on some such trip at present.

Grant skied for exercise. He skied around and around in the field behind the house as the sun went down and left the sky pink over a countryside that seemed to be bound by waves of blue-edged ice. Then he came back to the darkening house, turning the television news on while he made his supper. They had usually prepared supper together. One of them made the drinks and the other the fire, and they talked about his work (he was writing a study of legendary Norse wolves and particularly of the great wolf Fenrir, which swallows up Odin at the end of the world) and about whatever Fiona was reading and what they had been thinking during their close but separate day. This was their time of liveliest intimacy, though there was also, of course, the five or ten minutes of physical sweetness just after they got into bed—something that did not often end in sex but reassured them that sex was not over yet.

In a dream he showed a letter to one of his colleagues. The letter was from the roommate of a girl he had not thought of for a while and was sanctimonious and hostile, threatening in a whining way. The girl herself was someone he had parted from decently and it seemed unlikely that she would want to make a fuss, let alone try to kill herself, which was what the letter was elaborately trying to tell him she had done.

He had thought of the colleague as a friend. He was one of those husbands who had been among the first to throw away their neckties and leave home to spend every night on a floor mattress with a bewitching young mistress—coming to their offices, their classes, bedraggled and smelling of dope and incense. But now he took a dim view.

“I wouldn’t laugh,” he said to Grant— who did not think he had been laughing. “And if I were you I’d try to prepare Fiona.”

So Grant went off to find Fiona in Meadowlake—the old Meadowlake— and got into a lecture hall instead. Everybody was waiting there for him to teach his class. And sitting in the last, highest row was a flock of cold-eyed young women all in black robes, all in mourning, who never took their bitter stares off him, and pointedly did not write down, or care about, anything he was saying.

Fiona was in the first row, untroubled. “Oh phooey,” she said. “Girls that age are always going around talking about how they’ll kill themselves.”

He hauled himself out of the dream, took pills, and set about separating what was real from what was not.

There had been a letter, and the word “rat” had appeared in black paint on his office door, and Fiona, on being told that a girl had suffered from a bad crush on him, had said pretty much what she said in the dream. The colleague hadn’t come into it, and nobody had committed suicide. Grant hadn’t been disgraced. In fact, he had got off easy when you thought of what might have happened just a couple of years later. But word got around. Cold shoulders became conspicuous. They had few Christmas invitations and spent New Year’s Eve alone. Grant got drunk, and without its being required of him—also, thank God, without making the error of a confession—he promised Fiona a new life.

Nowhere had there been any acknowledgment that the life of a philanderer (if that was what Grant had to call himself—he who had not had half as many conquests as the man who had reproached him in his dream) involved acts of generosity, and even sacrifice. Many times he had catered to a woman’s pride, to her fragility, by offering more affection—or a rougher passion— than anything he really felt. All so that he could now find himself accused of wounding and exploiting and destroying self-esteem. And of deceiving Fiona—as, of course, he had. But would it have been better if he had done as others had done with their wives, and left her? He had never thought of such a thing. He had never stopped making love to Fiona. He had not stayed away from her for a single night. No making up elaborate stories in order to spend a weekend in San Francisco or in a tent on Manitoulin Island. He had gone easy on the dope and the drink, and he had continued to publish papers, serve on committees, make progress in his career. He had never had any intention of throwing over work and marriage and taking to the country to practice carpentry or keep bees.

But something like that had happened, after all. He had taken early retirement with a reduced pension. Fiona’s father had died, after some be-wildered and stoical time alone in the big house, and Fiona had inherited both that property and the farmhouse where her father had grown up, in the country near Georgian Bay.

It was a new life. He and Fiona worked on the house. They got cross-country skis. They were not very sociable but they gradually made some friends. There were no more hectic flirtations. No bare female toes creeping up under a man’s pants leg at a dinner party. No more loose wives.

Just in time, Grant was able to think, when the sense of injustice had worn down. The feminists and perhaps the sad silly girl herself and his cowardly so-called friends had pushed him out just in time. Out of a life that was in fact getting to be more trouble than it was worth. And that might eventually have cost him Fiona.

On the morning of the day when he was to go back to Meadowlake, for the first visit, Grant woke early. He was full of a solemn tingling, as in the old days on the morning of his first planned meeting with a new woman. The feeling was not precisely sexual. (Later, when the meetings had become routine, that was all it was.) There was an expectation of discovery, almost a spiritual expansion. Also timidity, humility, alarm.

There had been a thaw. Plenty of snow was left, but the dazzling hard landscape of earlier winter had crumbled. These pocked heaps under a gray sky looked like refuse in the fields. In the town near Meadowlake he found a florist’s shop and bought a large bouquet. He had never presented flowers to Fiona before. Or to anyone else. He entered the building feeling like a hopeless lover or a guilty husband in a cartoon.

“Wow. Narcissus this early,” Kristy said. “You must’ve spent a fortune.” She went along the hall ahead of him and snapped on the light in a sort of pantry, where she searched for a vase. She was a heavy young woman who looked as if she had given up on her looks in every department except her hair. That was blond and voluminous. All the puffed-up luxury of a cocktail waitress’s style, or a stripper’s, on top of such a workaday face and body.

“There now,” she said, and nodded him down the hall. “Name’s right on the door.”

So it was, on a nameplate decorated with bluebirds. He wondered whether to knock, and did, then opened the door and called her name.

She wasn’t there. The closet door was closed, the bed smoothed. Nothing on the bedside table, except a box of Kleenex and a glass of water. Not a single photograph or picture of any kind, not a book or a magazine. Perhaps you had to keep those in a cupboard.

He went back to the nurses’ station. Kristy said, “No?” with a surprise that he thought perfunctory. He hesitated, holding the flowers. She said, “O.K., O.K.—let’s set the bouquet down here.” Sighing, as if he were a backward child on his first day at school, she led him down the hall toward a large central space with skylights which seemed to be a general meeting area. Some people were sitting along the walls, in easy chairs, others at tables in the middle of the carpeted floor. None of them looked too bad. Old—some of them incapacitated enough to need wheelchairs—but decent. There had been some unnerving sights when he and Fiona visited Mr. Farquhar. Whiskers on old women’s chins, somebody with a bulged-out eye like a rotted plum. Dribblers, head wagglers, mad chatterers. Now it looked as if there’d been some weeding out of the worst cases.

“See?” said Kristy in a softer voice. “You just go up and say hello and try not to startle her. Just go ahead.”

He saw Fiona in profile, sitting close up to one of the card tables, but not playing. She looked a little puffy in the face, the flab on one cheek hiding the corner of her mouth, in a way it hadn’t done before. She was watching the play of the man she sat closest to. He held his cards tilted so that she could see them. When Grant got near the table she looked up. They all looked up—all the players at the table looked up, with displeasure. Then they immediately looked down at their cards, as if to ward off any intrusion.

But Fiona smiled her lopsided, abashed, sly, and charming smile and pushed back her chair and came round to him, putting her fingers to her mouth.

“Bridge,” she whispered. “Deadly serious. They’re quite rabid about it.” She drew him toward the coffee table, chatting. “I can remember being like that for a while at college. My friends and I would cut class and sit in the common room and smoke and play like cutthroats. Can I get you anything? A cup of tea? I’m afraid the coffee isn’t up to much here.”

Grant never drank tea.

He could not throw his arms around her. Something about her voice and smile, familiar as they were, something about the way she seemed to be guarding the players from him—as well as him from their displeasure—made that impossible.

“I brought you some flowers,” he said. “I thought they’d do to brighten up your room. I went to your room but you weren’t there.”

“Well, no,” she said. “I’m here.” She glanced back at the table.

Grant said, “You’ve made a new friend.” He nodded toward the man she’d been sitting next to. At this moment that man looked up at Fiona and she turned, either because of what Grant had said or because she felt the look at her back.

“It’s just Aubrey,” she said. “The funny thing is I knew him years and years ago. He worked in the store. The hardware store where my grandpa used to shop. He and I were always kidding around and he couldn’t get up the nerve to ask me out. Till the very last weekend and he took me to a ballgame. But when it was over my grandpa showed up to drive me home. I was up visiting for the summer. Visiting my grandparents—they lived on a farm.”

“Fiona. I know where your grandparents lived. It’s where we live. Lived.”

“Really?” she said, not paying her full attention because the cardplayer was sending her his look, which was one not of supplication but of command. He was a man of about Grant’s age, or a little older. Thick coarse white hair fell over his forehead and his skin was leathery but pale, yellowish-white like an old wrinkled-up kid glove. His long face was dignified and melancholy and he had something of the beauty of a powerful, discouraged, elderly horse. But where Fiona was concerned he was not discouraged.

“I better go back,” Fiona said, a blush spotting her newly fattened face. “He thinks he can’t play without me sitting there. It’s silly, I hardly know the game anymore. If I leave you now, you can entertain yourself ? It must all seem strange to you but you’ll be surprised how soon you get used to it. You’ll get to know who everybody is. Except that some of them are pretty well off in the clouds, you know—you can’t expect them all to get to know who you are.”

She slipped back into her chair and said something into Aubrey’s ear. She tapped her fingers across the back of his hand.

Grant went in search of Kristy and met her in the hall. She was pushing a cart with pitchers of apple juice and grape juice.

“Well?” she said.

Grant said, “Does she even know who I am?” He could not decide. She could have been playing a joke. It would not be unlike her. She had given herself away by that little pretense at the end, talking to him as if she thought perhaps he was a new resident. If it was a pretense.

Kristy said, “You just caught her at sort of a bad moment. Involved in the game.”

“She’s not even playing,” he said.

“Well, but her friend’s playing. Aubrey.”

“So who is Aubrey?”

“That’s who he is. Aubrey. Her friend. Would you like a juice?” Grant shook his head. “Oh look,” said Kristy. “They get these attachments. That takes over for a while. Best buddy sort of thing. It’s kind of a phase.”

“You mean she really might not know who I am?”

“She might not. Not today. Then tomorrow—you never know, do you? You’ll see the way it is, once you’ve been coming here for a while. You’ll learn not to take it all so serious. Learn to take it day by day.”

Day by day. But things really didn’t change back and forth and he didn’t get used to the way they were. Fiona was the one who seemed to get used to him, but only as some persistent visitor who took a special interest in her. Or perhaps even as a nuisance who must be prevented, according to her old rules of courtesy, from realizing that he was one. She treated him with a distracted, social sort of kindness that was successful in keeping him from asking the most obvious, the most necessary question: did she remember him as her husband of nearly fifty years? He got the impression that she would be embarrassed by such a question—embarrassed not for herself but for him.

Kristy told him that Aubrey had been the local representative of a company that sold weed killer “and all that kind of stuff” to farmers. And then when he was not very old or even retired, she said, he had suffered some unusual kind of damage.

“His wife is the one takes care of him, usually at home. She just put him in here on temporary care so she could get a break. Her sister wanted her to go to Florida. See, she’s had a hard time, you wouldn’t ever have expected a man like him—they just went on a holiday somewhere and he got something, like some bug that gave him a terrible high fever? And it put him in a coma and left him like he is now.”

Most afternoons the pair could be found at the card table. Aubrey had large, thick-fingered hands. It was difficult for him to manage his cards. Fiona shuffled and dealt for him and sometimes moved quickly to straighten a card that seemed to be slipping from his grasp. Grant would watch from across the room her darting move and quick laughing apology. He could see Aubrey’s husbandly frown as a wisp of her hair touched his cheek. Aubrey preferred to ignore her, as long as she stayed close.

But let her smile her greeting at Grant, let her push back her chair and get up to offer him tea—showing that she had accepted his right to be there— and Aubrey’s face took on its look of sombre consternation. He would let the cards slide from his fingers and fall on the floor to spoil the game. And Fiona then had to get busy and put things right.

If Fiona and Aubrey weren’t at the bridge table they might be walking along the halls, Aubrey hanging on to the railing with one hand and clutching Fiona’s arm or shoulder with the other. The nurses thought that it was a marvel, the way she had got him out of his wheelchair. Though for longer trips— to the conservatory at one end of the building or the television room at the other—the wheelchair was called for.

In the conservatory, the pair would find themselves a seat among the most lush and thick and tropical-looking plants—a bower, if you liked. Grant stood nearby, on occasion, on the other side of the greenery, listening. Mixed in with the rustle of the leaves and the sound of plashing water was Fiona’s soft talk and her laughter. Then some sort of chortle. Aubrey could talk, though his voice probably didn’t sound as it used to. He seemed to say something now—a couple of thick syllables.

Take care. He’s here. My love.

Grant made an effort, and cut his visits down to Wednesdays and Saturdays. Saturdays had a holiday bustle and tension. Families arrived in clusters. Mothers were usually in charge; they were the ones who kept the conversation afloat. Men seemed cowed, teen-agers affronted. No children or grandchildren appeared to visit Aubrey, and since they could not play cards—the tables being taken over for ice-cream parties—he and Fiona stayed clear of the Saturday parade. The conservatory was far too popular then for any of their intimate conversations. Those might be going on, of course, behind Fiona’s closed door. Grant could not manage to knock when he found it closed, though he stood there for some time staring at the Disney-style nameplate with an intense, a truly malignant dislike.

Or they might be in Aubrey’s room. But he did not know where that was. The more he explored this place the more corridors and seating spaces and ramps he discovered, and in his wanderings he was still apt to get lost. One Saturday he looked out a window and saw Fiona—it had to be her—wheeling Aubrey along one of the paved paths now cleared of snow and ice. She was wearing a silly wool hat and a jacket with swirls of blue and purple, the sort of thing he had seen on local women at the supermarket. It must be that they didn’t bother to sort out the wardrobes of the women who were roughly the same size and counted on the women not to recognize their own clothes anyway. They had cut her hair, too. They had cut away her angelic halo.

On a Wednesday, when everything was more normal and card games were going on again and the women in the Crafts Room were making silk flowers or costumed dolls—and when Aubrey and Fiona were again in evidence, so that it was possible for Grant to have one of his brief and friendly and maddening conversations with his wife—he said to her, “Why did they chop off your hair?”

Fiona put her hands up to her head, to check.

“Why—I never missed it,” she said.

When Grant had first started teaching Anglo-Saxon and Nordic literature he got the regular sort of students in his classes. But after a few years he noticed a change. Married women had started going back to school. Not with the idea of qualifying for a better job, or for any job, but simply to give themselves something more interesting to think about than their usual housework and hobbies. To enrich their lives. And perhaps it followed naturally that the men who taught them these things became part of the enrichment, that these men seemed to these women more mysterious and desirable than the men they still cooked for and slept with.

Those who signed up for Grant’s courses might have a Scandinavian background or they might have learned something about Norse mythology from Wagner or historical novels. There were also a few who thought he was teaching a Celtic language and for whom everything Celtic had a mystic allure. He spoke to such aspirants fairly roughly from his side of the desk.

“If you want to learn a pretty language go and learn Spanish. Then you can use it if you go to Mexico.”

Some took his warning and drifted away. Others seemed to be moved in a personal way by his demanding tone. They worked with a will and brought into his office, into his regulated satisfactory life, the great surprising bloom of their mature female compliance, their tremulous hope of approval.

He chose a woman named Jacqui Adams. She was the opposite of Fiona—short, cushiony, dark-eyed, effusive. A stranger to irony. The affair lasted for a year, until her husband was transferred. When they were saying goodbye in her car, she began to shake uncontrollably. It was as if she had hypothermia. She wrote to him a few times, but he found the tone of her letters overwrought and could not decide how to answer. He let the time for answering slip away while he became magically and unexpectedly involved with a girl who was young enough to be Jacqui’s daughter.

For another and more dizzying development had taken place while he was busy with Jacqui. Young girls with long hair and sandalled feet were coming into his office and all but declaring themselves ready for sex. The cautious approaches, the tender intimations of feeling required with Jacqui were out the window. A whirlwind hit him, as it did many others. Scandals burst wide open, with high and painful drama all round but a feeling that somehow it was better so. There were reprisals; there were firings. But those fired went off to teach at smaller, more tolerant colleges or Open Learning Centers, and many wives left behind got over the shock and took up the costumes, the sexual nonchalance of the girls who had tempted their men. Academic parties, which used to be so predictable, became a minefield. An epidemic had broken out, it was spreading like the Spanish flu. Only this time people ran after contagion, and few between sixteen and sixty seemed willing to be left out.

That was exaggeration, of course. Fiona was quite willing. And Grant himself did not go overboard. What he felt was mainly a gigantic increase in well-being. A tendency to pudginess which he had had since he was twelve years old disappeared. He ran up steps two at a time. He appreciated as never before a pageant of torn clouds and winter sunsets seen from his office window, the charm of antique lamps glowing between his neighbors’ living-room curtains, the cries of children in the park, at dusk, unwilling to leave the hill where they’d been tobogganing. Come summer, he learned the names of flowers. In his classroom, after being coached by his nearly voiceless mother-in-law (her affliction was cancer in the throat), he risked reciting the majestic and gory Icelandic ode, the Höfudlausn, composed to honor King Erik Bloodaxe by the skald whom that king had condemned to death.

Fiona had never learned Icelandic and she had never shown much respect for the stories that it preserved—the stories that Grant had taught and written about. She referred to their heroes as “old Njal” or “old Snorri.” But in the last few years she had developed an interest in the country itself and looked at travel guides. She read about William Morris’s trip, and Auden’s. She didn’t really plan to travel there. She said there ought to be one place you thought about and knew about and maybe longed for but never did get to see.

Nonetheless, the next time he went to Meadowlake, Grant brought Fiona a book he’d found of nineteenth-century watercolors made by a lady traveller to Iceland. It was a Wednesday. He went looking for her at the card tables but didn’t see her. A woman called out to him, “She’s not here. She’s sick.”

Her voice sounded self-important and excited—pleased with herself for having recognized him when he knew nothing about her. Perhaps also pleased with all she knew about Fiona, about Fiona’s life here, thinking it was maybe more than he knew.

“He’s not here, either,” she added.

Grant went to find Kristy, who didn’t have much time for him. She was talking to a weepy woman who looked like a first-time visitor.

“Nothing really,” she said, when he asked what was the matter with Fiona. “She’s just having a day in bed today, just a bit of an upset.”

Fiona was sitting straight up in the bed. He hadn’t noticed, the few times that he had been in this room, that this was a hospital bed and could be cranked up in such a way. She was wearing one of her high-necked maidenly gowns, and her face had a pallor that was like flour paste.

Aubrey was beside her in his wheelchair, pushed as close to the bed as he could get. Instead of the nondescript open-necked shirts he usually wore, he was wearing a jacket and tie. His natty-looking tweed hat was resting on the bed. He looked as if he had been out on important business.

Whatever he’d been doing, he looked worn out by it. He, too, was gray in the face.

They both looked up at Grant with a stony grief-ridden apprehension that turned to relief, if not to welcome, when they saw who he was. Not who they thought he’d be. They were hanging on to each other’s hands and they did not let go.

The hat on the bed. The jacket and tie.

It wasn’t that Aubrey had been out. It wasn’t a question of where he’d been or whom he’d been to see. It was where he was going.

Grant set the book down on the bed beside Fiona’s free hand.

“It’s about Iceland,” he said. “I thought maybe you’d like to look at it.”

“Why, thank you,” said Fiona. She didn’t look at the book.

“Iceland,” he said.

She said, “Ice-land.” The first syllable managed to hold a tinkle of interest, but the second fell flat. Anyway, it was necessary for her to turn her attention back to Aubrey, who was pulling his great thick hand out of hers. “What is it?” she said. “What is it, dear heart?” Grant had never heard her use this flowery expression before.

“Oh all right,” she said. “Oh here.” And she pulled a handful of tissues from the box beside her bed. Aubrey had begun to weep.

“Here. Here,” she said, and he got hold of the Kleenex as well as he could and made a few awkward but lucky swipes at his face. While he was occupied, Fiona turned to Grant.

“Do you by any chance have any influence around here?” she said in a whisper. “I’ve seen you talking to them . . .”

Aubrey made a noise of protest or weariness or disgust. Then his upper body pitched forward as if he wanted to throw himself against her. She scrambled half out of bed and caught him and held on to him. It seemed improper for Grant to help her.

“Hush,” Fiona was saying. “Oh, honey. Hush. We’ll get to see each other. We’ll have to. I’ll go and see you. You’ll come and see me.”

Aubrey made the same sound again with his face in her chest and there was nothing Grant could decently do but get out of the room.

“I just wish his wife would hurry up and get here,” Kristy said when he ran into her. “I wish she’d get him out of here and cut the agony short. We’ve got to start serving supper before long and how are we supposed to get her to swallow anything with him still hanging around?”

Grant said, “Should I stay?”

“What for? She’s not sick, you know.”

“To keep her company,” he said.

Kristy shook her head.

“They have to get over these things on their own. They’ve got short memories, usually. That’s not always so bad.”

Grant left without going back to Fiona’s room. He noticed that the wind was actually warm and the crows were making an uproar. In the parking lot a woman wearing a tartan pants suit was getting a folded-up wheelchair out of the trunk of her car.

Fiona did not get over her sorrow. She didn’t eat at mealtimes, though she pretended to, hiding food in her napkin. She was being given a supplementary drink twice a day—someone stayed and watched while she swallowed it down. She got out of bed and dressed herself, but all she wanted to do then was sit in her room. She wouldn’t have had any exercise at all if Kristy, or Grant during visiting hours, hadn’t walked her up and down in the corridors or taken her outside. Weeping had left her eyes raw-edged and dim. Her cardigan—if it was hers—would be buttoned crookedly. She had not got to the stage of leaving her hair unbrushed or her nails uncleaned, but that might come soon. Kristy said that her muscles were deteriorating, and that if she didn’t improve they would put her on a walker.

“But, you know, once they get a walker they start to depend on it and they never walk much anymore, just get wherever it is they have to go,” she said to Grant. “You’ll have to work at her harder. Try to encourage her.”

But Grant had no luck at that. Fiona seemed to have taken a dislike to him, though she tried to cover it up. Perhaps she was reminded, every time she saw him, of her last minutes with Aubrey, when she had asked him for help and he hadn’t helped her.

He didn’t see much point in mentioning their marriage now.

The supervisor called him in to her office. She said that Fiona’s weight was going down even with the supplement.

“The thing is, I’m sure you know, we don’t do any prolonged bed care on the first floor. We do it temporarily if someone isn’t feeling well, but if they get too weak to move around and be responsible we have to consider upstairs.”

He said he didn’t think that Fiona had been in bed that often.

“No. But if she can’t keep up her strength she will be. Right now she’s borderline.”

Grant said that he had thought the second floor was for people whose minds were disturbed.

“That, too,” she said.

The street Grant found himself driving down was called Blackhawks Lane. The houses all looked to have been built around the same time, perhaps thirty or forty years ago. The street was wide and curving and there were no sidewalks. Friends of Grant and Fiona’s had moved to places something like this when they began to have their children, and young families still lived here. There were basketball hoops over garage doors and tricycles in the driveways. Some of the houses had gone downhill. The yards were marked by tire tracks, the windows plastered with tinfoil or hung with faded flags. But a few seemed to have been kept up as well as possible by the people who had moved into them when they were new—people who hadn’t had the money or perhaps hadn’t felt the need to move on to some place better.

The house that was listed in the phone book as belonging to Aubrey and his wife was one of these. The front walk was paved with flagstones and bordered by hyacinths that stood as stiff as china flowers, alternately pink and blue.

He hadn’t remembered anything about Aubrey’s wife except the tartan suit he had seen her wearing in the parking lot. The tails of the jacket had flared open as she bent into the trunk of the car. He had got the impression of a trim waist and wide buttocks.

She was not wearing the tartan suit today. Brown belted slacks and a pink sweater. He was right about the waist— the tight belt showed she made a point of it. It might have been better if she didn’t, since she bulged out considerably above and below.

She could be ten or twelve years younger than her husband. Her hair was short, curly, artificially reddened. She had blue eyes—a lighter blue than Fiona’s—a flat robin’s-egg or turquoise blue, slanted by a slight puffiness. And a good many wrinkles, made more noticeable by a walnut-stain makeup. Or perhaps that was her Florida tan.

He said that he didn’t quite know how to introduce himself.

“I used to see your husband at Meadowlake. I’m a regular visitor there myself.”

“Yes,” said Aubrey’s wife, with an aggressive movement of her chin.

“How is your husband doing?”

The “doing” was added on at the last moment.

“He’s O.K.,” she said.

“My wife and he struck up quite a close friendship.”

“I heard about that.”

“I wanted to talk to you about something if you had a minute.”

“My husband did not try to start anything with your wife if that’s what you’re getting at,” she said. “He did not molest her. He isn’t capable of it and he wouldn’t anyway. From what I heard it was the other way round.”

Grant said, “No. That isn’t it at all. I didn’t come here with any complaints about anything.”

“Oh,” she said. “Well, I’m sorry. I thought you did. You better come in then. It’s blowing cold in through the door. It’s not as warm out today as it looks.”

So it was something of a victory for him even to get inside.

She took him past the living room, saying, “We’ll have to sit in the kitchen, where I can hear Aubrey.”

Grant caught sight of two layers of front-window curtains, both blue, one sheer and one silky, a matching blue sofa and a daunting pale carpet, various bright mirrors and ornaments. Fiona had a word for those sort of swooping curtains—she said it like a joke, though the women she’d picked it up from used it seriously. Any room that Fiona fixed up was bare and bright. She would have deplored the crowding of all this fancy stuff into such a small space. From a room off the kitchen—a sort of sun-room, though the blinds were drawn against the afternoon brightness—he could hear the sounds of television.

The answer to Fiona’s prayers sat a few feet away, watching what sounded like a ballgame. His wife looked in at him.

She said, “You O.K.?” and partly closed the door.

“You might as well have a cup of coffee,” she said to Grant. “My son got him on the sports channel a year ago Christmas. I don’t know what we’d do without it.”

On the kitchen counters there were all sorts of contrivances and appliances—coffeemaker, food processor, knife sharpener, and some things Grant didn’t know the names or uses of. All looked new and expensive, as if they had just been taken out of their wrappings, or were polished daily.

He thought it might be a good idea to admire things. He admired the coffeemaker she was using and said that he and Fiona had always meant to get one. This was absolutely untrue—Fiona had been devoted to a European contraption that made only two cups at a time.

“They gave us that,” she said. “Our son and his wife. They live in Kamloops. B.C. They send us more stuff than we can handle. It wouldn’t hurt if they would spend the money to come and see us instead.”

Grant said philosophically, “I suppose they’re busy with their own lives.”

“They weren’t too busy to go to Hawaii last winter. You could understand it if we had somebody else in the family, closer at hand. But he’s the only one.”

She poured the coffee into two brown-and-green ceramic mugs that she took from the amputated branches of a ceramic tree trunk that sat on the table.

“People do get lonely,” Grant said. He thought he saw his chance now. “If they’re deprived of seeing somebody they care about, they do feel sad. Fiona, for instance. My wife.”

“I thought you said you went and visited her.”

“I do,” he said. “That’s not it.”

Then he took the plunge, going on to make the request he’d come to make. Could she consider taking Aubrey back to Meadowlake, maybe just one day a week, for a visit? It was only a drive of a few miles. Or if she’d like to take the time off—Grant hadn’t thought of this before and was rather dismayed to hear himself suggest it—then he himself could take Aubrey out there, he wouldn’t mind at all. He was sure he could manage it. While he talked she moved her closed lips and her hidden tongue as if she were trying to identify some dubious flavor. She brought milk for his coffee and a plate of ginger cookies.

“Homemade,” she said as she set the plate down. There was challenge rather than hospitality in her tone. She said nothing more until she had sat down, poured milk into her coffee, and stirred it.

Then she said no.

“No. I can’t do that. And the reason is, I’m not going to upset him.”

“Would it upset him?” Grant said earnestly.

“Yes, it would. It would. That’s no way to do. Bringing him home and taking him back. That would just confuse him.”

“But wouldn’t he understand that it was just a visit? Wouldn’t he get into the pattern of it?”

“He understands everything all right.”

She said this as if he had offered an insult to Aubrey. “But it’s still an interruption. And then I’ve got to get him all ready and get him into the car, and he’s a big man, he’s not so easy to manage as you might think. I’ve got to maneuver him into the car and pack his chair and all that and what for? If I go to all that trouble I’d prefer to take him someplace that was more fun.”

“But even if I agreed to do it?” Grant said, keeping his tone hopeful and reasonable. “It’s true, you shouldn’t have the trouble.”

“You couldn’t,” she said flatly. “You don’t know him. You couldn’t handle him. He wouldn’t stand for you doing for him. All that bother and what would he get out of it?”

Grant didn’t think he should mention Fiona again.

“It’d make more sense to take him to the mall,” she said. “Or now the lake boats are starting to run again, he might get a charge out of going and watching that.”

She got up and fetched her cigarettes and lighter from the window above the sink.

“You smoke?” she said.

He said no, thanks, though he didn’t know if a cigarette was being offered.

“Did you never? Or did you quit?”

“Quit,” he said.

“How long ago was that?”

He thought about it.

“Thirty years. No—more.”

He had decided to quit around the time he started up with Jacqui. But he couldn’t remember whether he quit first, and thought a big reward was coming to him for quitting, or thought that the time had come to quit, now that he had such a powerful diversion.

“I’ve quit quitting,” she said, lighting up. “Just made a resolution to quit quitting, that’s all.”

Maybe that was the reason for the wrinkles. Somebody—a woman—had told him that women who smoked developed a special set of fine facial wrinkles. But it could have been from the sun, or just the nature of her skin—her neck was noticeably wrinkled as well. Wrinkled neck, youthfully full and uptilted breasts. Women of her age usually had these contradictions. The bad and good points, the genetic luck or lack of it, all mixed up together. Very few kept their beauty whole, though shadowy, as Fiona had done. And perhaps that wasn’t even true. Perhaps he only thought that because he’d known Fiona when she was young. When Aubrey looked at his wife did he see a high-school girl full of scorn and sass, with a tilt to her blue eyes, pursing her fruity lips around a forbidden cigarette?

“So your wife’s depressed?” Aubrey’s wife said. “What’s your wife’s name? I forget.”

“It’s Fiona.”

“Fiona. And what’s yours? I don’t think I was ever told that.”

Grant said, “It’s Grant.”

She stuck her hand out unexpectedly across the table.

“Hello, Grant. I’m Marian.”

“So now we know each other’s names,” she said, “there’s no point in not telling you straight out what I think. I don’t know if he’s still so stuck on seeing your—on seeing Fiona. Or not. I don’t ask him and he’s not telling me. Maybe just a passing fancy. But I don’t feel like taking him back there in case it turns out to be more than that. I can’t afford to risk it. I don’t want him upset and carrying on. I’ve got my hands full with him as it is. I don’t have any help. It’s just me here. I’m it.”

“Did you ever consider—I’m sure it’s very hard for you—” Grant said. “Did you ever consider his going in there for good?”

He had lowered his voice almost to a whisper but she did not seem to feel a need to lower hers.

“No,” she said. “I’m keeping him right here.”

Grant said, “Well. That’s very good and noble of you.” He hoped the word “noble” had not sounded sarcastic. He had not meant it to be.

“You think so?” she said. “Noble is not what I’m thinking about.”

“Still. It’s not easy.”

“No, it isn’t. But the way I am, I don’t have much choice. I don’t have the money to put him in there unless I sell the house. The house is what we own outright. Otherwise I don’t have anything in the way of resources. Next year I’ll have his pension and my pension, but even so I couldn’t afford to keep him there and hang on to the house. And it means a lot to me, my house does.”

“It’s very nice,” said Grant.

“Well, it’s all right. I put a lot into it. Fixing it up and keeping it up. I don’t want to lose it.”

“No. I see your point.”

“The company left us high and dry,” she said. “I don’t know all the ins and outs of it but basically he got shoved out. It ended up with them saying he owed them money and when I tried to find out what was what he just went on saying it’s none of my business. What I think is he did something pretty stupid. But I’m not supposed to ask so I shut up. You’ve been married. You are married. You know how it is. And in the middle of me finding out about this we’re supposed to go on this trip and can’t get out of it. And on the trip he takes sick from this virus you never heard of and goes into a coma. So that pretty well gets him off the hook.”

Grant said, “Bad luck.”

“I don’t mean he got sick on purpose. It just happened. He’s not mad at me anymore and I’m not mad at him. It’s just life. You can’t beat life.”

She flicked her tongue in a cat’s businesslike way across her top lip, getting the cookie crumbs. “I sound like I’m quite the philosopher, don’t I? They told me out there you used to be a university professor.”

“Quite a while ago,” Grant said.

“I bet I know what you’re thinking,” she said. “You’re thinking there’s a mercenary type of a person.”

“I’m not making judgments of that sort. It’s your life.”

“You bet it is.”

He thought they should end on a more neutral note. So he asked her if her husband had worked in a hardware store in the summers, when he was going to school.

“I never heard about it,” she said. “I wasn’t raised here.”

Grant realized he’d failed with Aubrey’s wife. Marian. He had thought that what he’d have to contend with would be a woman’s natural sexual jealousy—or her resentment, the stubborn remains of sexual jealousy. He had not had any idea of the way she might be looking at things. And yet in some depressing way the conversation had not been unfamiliar to him. That was because it reminded him of conversations he’d had with people in his own family. His relatives, probably even his mother, had thought the way Marian thought. Money first. They had believed that when other people did not think that way it was because they had lost touch with reality. That was how Marian would see him, certainly. A silly person, full of boring knowledge and protected by some fluke from the truth about life. A person who didn’t have to worry about holding on to his house and could go around dreaming up the fine generous schemes that he believed would make another person happy. What a jerk, she would be thinking now.

Being up against a person like that made him feel hopeless, exasperated, finally almost desolate. Why? Because he couldn’t be sure of holding on to himself, against people like that? Because he was afraid that in the end they were right? Yet he might have married her. Or some girl like that. If he’d stayed back where he belonged. She’d have been appetizing enough. Probably a flirt. The fussy way she had of shifting her buttocks on the kitchen chair, her pursed mouth, a slightly contrived air of menace—that was what was left of the more or less innocent vulgarity of a small-town flirt.

She must have had some hopes when she picked Aubrey. His good looks, his salesman’s job, his white-collar expectations. She must have believed that she would end up better off than she was now. And so it often happened with those practical people. In spite of their calculations, their survival instincts, they might not get as far as they had quite reasonably expected. No doubt it seemed unfair.

In the kitchen the first thing he saw was the light blinking on his answering machine. He thought the same thing he always thought now. Fiona. He pressed the button before he took his coat off.

“Hello, Grant. I hope I got the right person. I just thought of something. There is a dance here in town at the Legion supposed to be for singles on Saturday night and I am on the lunch committee, which means I can bring a free guest. So I wondered whether you would happen to be interested in that? Call me back when you get a chance.”

A woman’s voice gave a local number. Then there was a beep and the same voice started talking again.

“I just realized I’d forgotten to say who it was. Well, you probably recognized the voice. It’s Marian. I’m still not so used to these machines. And I wanted to say I realize you’re not a single and I don’t mean it that way. I’m not either, but it doesn’t hurt to get out once in a while. If you are interested you can call me and if you are not you don’t need to bother. I just thought you might like the chance to get out. It’s Marian speaking. I guess I already said that. O.K. then. Goodbye.”

Her voice on the machine was different from the voice he’d heard a short time ago in her house. Just a little different in the first message, more so in the second. A tremor of nerves there, an affected nonchalance, a hurry to get through and a reluctance to let go.

Something had happened to her. But when had it happened? If it had been immediate, she had concealed it very successfully all the time he was with her. More likely it came on her gradually, maybe after he’d gone away. Not necessarily as a blow of attraction. Just the realization that he was a possibility, a man on his own. More or less on his own. A possibility that she might as well try to follow up.

But she’d had the jitters when she made the first move. She had put herself at risk. How much of herself he could not yet tell. Generally a woman’s vulnerability increased as time went on, as things progressed. All you could tell at the start was that if there was an edge of it then, there’d be more later. It gave him a satisfaction—why deny it?—to have brought that out in her. To have roused something like a shimmer, a blurring, on the surface of her personality. To have heard in her testy broad vowels this faint plea.

He set out the eggs and mushrooms to make himself an omelette. Then he thought he might as well pour a drink.

Anything was possible. Was that true—was anything possible? For instance, if he wanted to, would he be able to break her down, get her to the point where she might listen to him about taking Aubrey back to Fiona? And not just for visits but for the rest of Aubrey’s life. And what would become of him and Marian after he’d delivered Aubrey to Fiona?

Marian would be sitting in her house now, waiting for him to call. Or probably not sitting. Doing things to keep herself busy. She might have fed Aubrey while Grant was buying the mushrooms and driving home. She might now be preparing him for bed. But all the time she would be conscious of the phone, of the silence of the phone. Maybe she would have calculated how long it would take Grant to drive home. His address in the phone book would have given her a rough idea of where he lived. She would calculate how long, then add to that the time it might take him to shop for supper (figuring that a man alone would shop every day). Then a certain amount of time for him to get around to listening to his messages. And as the silence persisted she’d think of other things. Other errands he might have had to do before he got home. Or perhaps a dinner out, a meeting that meant he would not get home at suppertime at all.

What conceit on his part. She was above all things a sensible woman. She would go to bed at her regular time thinking that he didn’t look as if he’d be a decent dancer anyway. Too stiff, too professorial.

He stayed near the phone, looking at magazines, but he didn’t pick it up when it rang again.

“Grant. This is Marian. I was down in the basement putting the wash in the dryer and I heard the phone and when I got upstairs whoever it was had hung up. So I just thought I ought to say I was here. If it was you and if you are even home. Because I don’t have a machine, obviously, so you couldn’t leave a message. So I just wanted. To let you know.” The time was now twenty-five after ten.

“Bye.”

He would say that he’d just got home. There was no point in bringing to her mind the picture of his sitting here weighing the pros and cons.

Drapes. That would be her word for the blue curtains—drapes. And why not? He thought of the ginger cookies so perfectly round that she had to announce they were homemade, the ceramic coffee mugs on their ceramic tree, a plastic runner, he was sure, protecting the hall carpet. A high-gloss exactness and practicality that his mother had never achieved but would have admired—was that why he could feel this twinge of bizarre and unreliable affection? Or was it because he’d had two more drinks after the first?

The walnut-stain tan—he believed now that it was a tan—of her face and neck would most likely continue into her cleavage, which would be deep, crêpey-skinned, odorous and hot. He had that to think of as he dialled the number that he had already written down. That and the practical sensuality of her cat’s tongue. Her gemstone eyes.

Fiona was in her room but not in bed. She was sitting by the open window, wearing a seasonable but oddly short and bright dress. Through the window came a heady warm blast of lilacs in bloom and the spring manure spread over the fields.

She had a book open in her lap.

She said, “Look at this beautiful book I found. It’s about Iceland. You wouldn’t think they’d leave valuable books lying around in the rooms. But I think they’ve got the clothes mixed up—I never wear yellow.”

“Fiona,” he said.

“Are we all checked out now?” she said. He thought the brightness of her voice was wavering a little. “You’ve been gone a long time.”

“Fiona, I’ve brought a surprise for you. Do you remember Aubrey?”

She stared at Grant for a moment, as if waves of wind had come beating into her face. Into her face, into her head, pulling everything to rags. All rags and loose threads.

“Names elude me,” she said harshly.

Then the look passed away as she retrieved, with an effort, some bantering grace. She set the book down carefully and stood up and lifted her arms to put them around him. Her skin or her breath gave off a faint new smell, a smell that seemed to Grant like green stems in rank water.

“I’m happy to see you,” she said, both sweetly and formally. She pinched his earlobes, hard.

“You could have just driven away,” she said. “Just driven away without a care in the world and forsook me. Forsooken me. Forsaken.”

He kept his face against her white hair, her pink scalp, her sweetly shaped skull.

He said, “Not a chance.”","Fiona and Grant are a married couple. Fiona's mother is Icelandic and politically active while her father is a cardiologist.

The Boss,Robert Coover,"The gunman lights a cigarette, watches despondently as dusk falls upon the empty alley. He is alone in a lonely place, summoned here to receive instructions from a master criminal known only as the Boss, but the Boss isn’t here. No one is. It’s spooky. He feels like a marked man. The Boss is known for his ruthlessness. When he orders a killing, someone dies. The gunman would like there to be witnesses for what happens next, but the alley’s deserted.

He glances at his watch, a gift from the Boss. Face a gold coin, no numbers. A joke, probably: time is money. Or, maybe, money is time; it depends on what you’re short of. The Boss is a great joker. The watch hands are hair-thin, like the edge of a razor blade, hard to see, especially in this fading light. There and not there, like time itself. Which is perhaps not being clocked—perhaps that’s what the numberless face is saying. How can you measure the shit you’re buried in? He doesn’t know what keeps the watch running. Battery inside, maybe. When the battery dies? Don’t think about it.

On one assignment or another, the gunman has wasted a few suckers in alleys like this, but not many. His specialty is knocking them off in train stations and hotel lobbies or on the street in broad daylight. There’s a greater risk of getting nabbed, so always an extra thrill. Which is why he took up doing the Boss’s dirty work. Thrills remind him that he’s alive, when not much else does.

Overhead, a street lamp comes on, its yellow light a mere stain under the dimming sky. Then a woman passes. It’s about time, the gunman thinks. Has she been sent by the Boss? Is she his witness? His victim? His executioner? His hand is inside his jacket, resting on the butt of the revolver holstered under his armpit. Probably just an innocent working girl, looking for a pickup, wandering into a place where she doesn’t belong. Which wouldn’t stop the Boss from targeting her. Or using her.

You looking for someone, sister? he asks, lurking in the shadows, his cigarette bobbing as he speaks.

I don’t know, she says. She casts an inquisitive gaze at him, then quickly looks away. A signal? He should perhaps throw himself behind the trash cans, but her tender scrutiny has fixed him where he stands.

She walks slowly away into the shadows at the far end of the alley, then swivels and walks back again toward the light. She appears frightened, lost. Touchingly vulnerable. Above her, the street lamp sways rhythmically, causing shadows to stretch and recede, stretch and recede, like a slowly beating heart. She pauses under it and looks around, clearly thinking about something. She’s no beauty, but she has sweet ways. His hard heart softens. He takes his hand off the revolver.

When she turns to walk down the alley again, the gunman flicks his cigarette away and walks with her, moving as she moves. Left, right, left . . . it’s a kind of dance. She asks if he’s making fun of her. He says he doesn’t know how to make fun. In truth, he feels caught up in something fundamental. Benumbing. A feeling he hasn’t had before. Abstract, yet oddly erotic.

It won’t do any good, she says, reading him.

Yeah, I know, lady. But I like it.

They reach the dark end of the alley, still moving together, and turn back toward the swaying street lamp. The alley seems almost to fade away, the lamp’s glow to brighten. There are bats twittering somewhere. Time itself seems to stop, even though he knows it’s still grinding inexorably toward something messy. The Boss has plans that haven’t happened yet. Never mind. Worry about them when they do.

When their dance ends, night has fully descended, sharpening the contrast between the pool of lamplight they have stepped into and the rest of the world, lost in the darkness beyond. That was great, he says. She looks up at him, her face pale but radiant in the light. She nods. Her sad smile seems to say, Yes, but it’s not enough, is it? She stares down at her feet, and when she does so, her face is masked in shadow. Is she about to betray him? he wonders. Does he care?

She starts suddenly, glances back down the alley. He follows her gaze. Uh-oh. Something is moving. His hand, too slowly, is inside his jacket. Watch out! she cries, and throws herself in front of him. A shot rings out. She collapses into his arms. Holding her, he fires impotently into the darkness. His bullets ricochet through the alley like ironic laughter. Hang on, baby! he pleads, but it’s too late.

It must be . . . why . . . she whispers, and dies in his arms.

His heart hardens again. Rage bites at the corners of his eyes. He doesn’t understand a fucking thing.","The story follows a gunman who is waiting in an empty alley for instructions from his boss, known as the Boss. Feeling uneasy and alone, the gunman reflects on the Boss's reputation for ruthlessness. As he glances at his watch, a gift from the Boss, he ponders the significance of time and the uncertainty of his own fate.

The gunman usually carries out his killings in more public places for the thrill and risk involved. However, he has taken up working for the Boss because it provides him with a sense of being alive. As dusk falls, a woman passes by the alley. The gunman wonders if she has been sent by the Boss and if she is meant to be his witness, victim, or executioner.

Approaching the woman, the gunman engages in a conversation with her. She seems unsure of what she is looking for and appears vulnerable. The gunman is drawn to her and feels a sense of connection. They walk together, their movements synchronized, as if in a dance. The woman senses that their encounter won't lead to anything substantial, but the gunman admits that he enjoys it.

As they reach the end of the alley and turn back toward the street lamp, the atmosphere becomes surreal. Time seems to stand still, and the alley fades away. The gunman acknowledges the impending messy plans of the Boss but chooses not to worry about them yet.

Their dance comes to an end as night fully descends. They find themselves in the pool of light under the street lamp, isolated from the darkness surrounding them. The moment is brief but powerful. The woman's face, both pale and radiant, suggests that their encounter is not enough for her. As she looks down, a sense of betrayal crosses the gunman's mind, but he wonders if he truly cares.

Suddenly, the woman senses danger and warns the gunman. He reaches for his gun too slowly as she throws herself in front of him. A shot is fired, and she collapses into his arms. In a fit of rage, the gunman fires into the darkness, but it is too late. The woman whispers her confusion and dies.

The gunman's heart hardens once again, and he is left with anger and a lack of understanding. The story leaves the reader questioning the nature of their encounter and the meaning behind the woman's sacrifice.","The story follows a gunman who finds himself alone in a desolate alley, waiting for instructions from a notorious criminal called the Boss. As dusk falls, he becomes aware of the eerie emptiness and feels like a marked man. The Boss is known for his ruthlessness, and the gunman hopes for witnesses to what will unfold next, but there are none.

The gunman notices his unusual watch, a gift from the Boss, with a gold coin face devoid of numbers. The watch serves as a reminder that time is valuable, possibly implying that one's life can be measured by it. The watch's thin hands resemble a razor blade's edge, emphasizing the fleeting nature of time and how it can cut through life. The gunman tries not to dwell on the idea that his time may also be running out.

Although the gunman has carried out many killings in train stations, hotels, and busy streets, he embraces the risk and thrill associated with daylight situations. This is why he has become the Boss's hitman, as it reminds him that he's alive when nothing else does.

As the street lamp flickers on, a woman passes by, sparking the gunman's curiosity. He wonders if she is a witness, victim, or perhaps even the one sent by the Boss. The gunman's hand hovers near his concealed revolver, ready for any scenario. However, he dismisses the idea that she may just be a lost girl stumbling into danger, knowing that the Boss wouldn't hesitate to manipulate or target her.

Engaging in conversation, the gunman and the woman engage in a silent dance, moving together in a strange synchrony. Their interaction carries a profound and unfamiliar emotion for the gunman, softening his tough exterior. They share a connection, despite the looming danger.

As they approach the end of the alley, they turn back towards the swaying street lamp, surrounded by an atmosphere of suspended time. The alley fades away, and the lamp's glow intensifies, making their surroundings feel ethereal. Night fully descends upon them, emphasizing the contrast between the illuminated pool of light and the dark world beyond. The encounter is brief, but it leaves a lasting impression on both of them.

When their dance concludes, the tranquility is abruptly disrupted. The woman senses danger and warns the gunman. His hand reaches for his gun, but before he can react, the woman sacrifices herself by throwing herself in front of him. A shot rings out, and she falls into his arms. In a futile attempt to retaliate, the gunman fires into the darkness, but it only echoes back at him. As she dies, confusion and rage consume the gunman, leaving him with unanswered questions.

The story explores the character of the unnamed gunman, his connection with the woman, and the complexities of his life as a hitman under the Boss's command. It delves into themes of time, mortality, and the unexpected emotions that can arise amidst violence and danger.",s1
The Hairless Are Careless,Colin Barrett,"“Prejudicial of me, I know,” said Tommy, nodding at the man in front of them at the pump, filling up his car’s tank, “but I can’t help think of the hairless as careless.”

“Like how?” Ernie said.

“Like they’ve lost their hair,” said Tommy.

“As in it’s their own fault, you mean,” said Ernie.

“Like they’ve misplaced it, of their own accord. You lose a thing of your own accord, in most cases.”

“You mean like if you sort of stop noticing it in the mirror,” Luke, who loafed at a diagonal angle across the back seat of Tommy’s car, as if he were asleep, bestirred himself now to chip in. “Like if you get the same haircut every time and begin to take your hair for granted, and sort of stop seeing it, in a sense, and so but one day it disappears.”

“Like you were deep down wishing for it,” said Ernie.

“Maybe not wishing for it, exactly,” muttered Tommy, although that was kind of what he thought. He’d always had this notion about hair—that it was sentient, that it somehow possessed the propensity to tell whether it was appreciated or not—as far back as he could remember. It was just a dumb notion. One of Tommy’s uncles had been a nemesis of his when he was a kid. The uncle, pale and pimpled, as sinisterly skinny as an adolescent, even in his forties, had been bald, and Tommy had always wanted to impute that baldness to some inherent deficiency of character.

“In any case, I don’t think that’s the way it works,” said Ernie.

“I understand that’s not the way it works,” said Tommy.

The pump’s nozzle in hand, the bald man was staring into the distance with the unprepossessing vacancy of someone urinating at a trough, his pink tie snagged up over his shoulder and flapping in the breeze like the tongue of a trotting dog. He was actually young, around Tommy, Ernie, and Luke’s age—late twenties—but there was a weathered quality to the skin covering his skull, patches of paler and darker pigment, that made Tommy wonder if the man had recently had chemo.

It was 5 P.M. on a Friday. The three were due to start the evening weekend shift at the Oasis water-cooler factory in an hour. Ernie and Tommy were machine operators. Luke was on the assembly line, sticking the warning stickers on the interior frames of the coolers as they rolled by him at a rate of one every three seconds. Luke was a qualified electrician, but had shown up to work insufficiently sober one too many times, botched the wiring in one house too many—and then had to take whatever he could get. Most people stuck the gruelling monotony of the assembly line for only a few months: they either got promoted elsewhere or quit. Luke had been on the line for eighteen months straight. As far as Tommy was concerned, it had turned the lad insane. Tommy and Ernie’s job was also boring, but in a more involved way. Every few weeks, there was some adjustment or recalibration to the cutting equipment that needed to be implemented, plus they were in charge of a team of four lifters—teen-agers, mostly, who pulled the still-hot casings out of the molds. When things threatened to get too much, they would send the youngsters on errands for glass hammers, rungless ladders, sky hooks.

The bald man went into the petrol station, came back out licking an ice-cream cone, and got into his motor.

“That’s actually a tasty car,” Ernie pointed out.

“Rental,” said Luke.

“How do you know?” asked Tommy.

“You know,” said Luke.

On their first break, at 8 P.M. that night, smoking outside the warehouse entrance, Tommy and Ernie spotted the bald man exiting the front offices, his white shirt and pale head giving him a lunar aspect as he crossed the factory lot. There was a weird atmosphere in the plant that weekend, rumors spreading on the floor with a sour excitability, conjecture traded and revised at every canteen break. By Monday morning, the employees had put the pieces of a picture together. The consensus was that the bald man was an American, an emissary from the central office over in Massachusetts or Minnesota, Milwaukee or Manitoba, or wherever the hell the central office was, and that he was here to inform them the factory was going to go. On Monday afternoon, management sent out an e-mail advising of an exciting, company-wide root and branch realignment of resources, which would allow for a dramatic expansion in the company’s productivity and scale but that, also, somehow, involved cutting the human staff in the Irish plant by sixty per cent.

“Actually, the factory is fine. It’s the employees that are fucked,” Ernie glossed bitterly, the three sitting in Staunton’s pub the following Monday night.

“We’re being automated,” said Tommy.

“I can’t believe we are being automated,” said Luke, delighted at an impending return to unemployment, so long as it wasn’t his fault.

“The fatuous head on him, coming out of the petrol station,” said Ernie. “Eating an ice-cream cone, the contented little motherfucker.”

“Someone had to do it,” said Tommy.

“I wish you hadn’t pointed him out, though,” said Ernie.

“What did I do?” said Tommy.

“You had to point him out like that. Bring him up. We hadn’t seen him until then.”

Luke flagged down the barman, asked for three neat Jemmies.

“He’s right, though,” said Luke to Tommy. “It’s like you had to pass that remark on him—he didn’t exist until then. If you hadn’t opened your mouth, we wouldn’t have seen him in the forecourt; if we hadn’t seen him there, then it follows that we would also not have seen him in at work.”

“No bald bastard, no redundancies,” concluded Ernie.

“In that case, I take full responsibility,” said Tommy.

Luke was repeatedly ducking his arm forward and making a precise little gesture with his thumb and forefinger.

“See that,” he said. “I did that every three seconds of every hour, ten hours a day, five days a week, for the guts of the last two years.” He closed his eyes. “I do it in my sleep; I dream of the frames going by. After they bury me, I’ll wear a spot in the lid of the coffin making the same gesture.”

“But you’re already dead,” muttered Tommy.

“That is true,” said Luke.

“Nobody is lucky enough to ever die just the once,” said Tommy.

After a while, Luke said to Tommy, “What are you going to do?”

City was playing United on the flat-screen above the bar, but the sound was off. The movement of the players seemed weightless, somehow insubstantial, without the anchoring noise of the crowd and the commentary.

“Maybe give the Premier League another shot,” said Tommy. He’d gone to England when he was twelve, trialled at Everton, signed on for their academy, blown the knee out at fifteen, spent a year in physio, spent two years after that doggedly trialling: at Bury, at Rochdale, at Lincoln, at Hamilton fucking Academical, then was clinically depressed from eighteen to twenty-two, then got the Oasis job.

“Sure look,” said Ernie in that way the Irish had, the rising cadence suggesting a phrase that preceded a consolation.

Luke looked at Ernie. Tommy looked at Ernie. Ernie opened his mouth, and nothing came out.","Tommy, Ernie, and Luke are discussing bald people while waiting at a petrol station. Tommy believes that being bald is a sign of carelessness or self-inflicted hair loss. They notice a bald man filling up his car and wonder if he had recently undergone chemotherapy. The three friends work at the Oasis water-cooler factory and are about to start their evening shift. They talk about the monotony of their jobs, and Luke, who used to be an electrician but now works on the assembly line, seems to have been driven slightly mad by the repetitive work.

Later, during their break, they see the bald man leaving the factory's front offices. Rumors circulate that the factory will be shut down or automated, leading to job cuts. Management sends an email confirming the staff reduction. Tommy, Ernie, and Luke meet at a pub and discuss how they are being replaced by automation. They blame Tommy for pointing out the bald man at the petrol station, as it seems that seeing him symbolized the impending job loss. They joke about the situation and talk about their uncertain futures.

The story ends with Luke asking Tommy what he plans to do next. Tommy suggests trying his luck in the Premier League again, but it's unclear if he's serious. The friends watch a football match on TV, and Ernie attempts to offer some consolation but fails to find the right words.","Tommy and his friends, Ernie and Luke, are at a petrol station when they notice a bald man filling up his car. Tommy makes a prejudiced remark about bald people, suggesting they are careless and have lost their hair on purpose. The conversation evolves into a discussion about the meaning behind losing one's hair, with Luke suggesting that it could be a subconscious desire. They later see the bald man again at their workplace, the Oasis water-cooler factory, and rumors circulate about potential layoffs. It is eventually confirmed that the factory will be automated, leading to significant job cuts. Tommy's friends blame him for pointing out the bald man, as they believe that if they hadn't noticed him, the redundancies wouldn't have occurred.

Smithereens,Aleksandar Hemon,"Near our mountain cabin, in Jahorina, there was once a hotel called Šator. It was open only in the winter for the skiing season. When you stood outside the hotel under a frigid, starry sky, you could smell cafeteria grease, wood fire, and cigarette smoke, and hear the thumping from the disco club in the basement. For the rest of the year, the hotel was vacant. One summer, when I was eleven, I broke into the hotel bar by cracking open its window—it took me an hour—and stole a bottle of blueberry juice. A guy who was a bartender there in the winter, but idled in the summer, caught me and blackmailed me, asking for money not to tell my parents. I told him to fuck off. He told my parents. They punished me, but that blueberry juice was the sweetest of potions. The hotel’s cleaning staff was a woman of undetermined body shape and age, named Baja, who spent summer days sitting on the hotel balcony, looking at nothing, always wearing a blue overcoat and a black scarf on her head, one of its corners covering her jaw to keep it warm. She was, like a ghost, impervious to pain. She had an eternal toothache that she would not treat, the abscess swelling until it had devoured and destroyed one of her eyes. Nobody ever saw her clean anything, though a friend of mine who’d stayed at the hotel told me that Baja had once walked into his room without knocking, looked around, and said, “Why don’t you clean this up? It’s disgusting.” Right behind the hotel, there was a crested boulder, which my sister and I would climb when there was nothing else to do. From the top, we could see the weekend-house cluster below and hear the buzzing of circular saws, the banging of hammers, the din of aspiration, for the weekenders were perpetually getting ready for some future in which active life would be successfully completed and there’d be nothing but peace, virginal nature, and retirement. The war would put an end to that ambition, but back then, when we were kids, the future was always on its way, its advance currents flowing through everything we knew or wanted to know. If we looked away from the house cluster, wooded vales and peaks, meadows and roads stretched toward Sarajevo and beyond, onward to the horizon, into which, at the end of the day, the sun would slide like a coin into a slot. We’d stand at the edge of the boulder, pine tips emerging from the verdant void beneath our feet, and we’d look, and look, and look: our visual field had no limits, just as our life had no end. The garbage from the hotel was dumped right behind it, down the slope at the foot of the boulder. My sister and I didn’t find that strange. By the time we emerged from the unconscious part of our childhood, the world seemed fully established, everything as it was supposed to be, all the points and objects fixed, all the hierarchies and structures natural and unalterable. We’d descend from the peak to the garbage dump to browse through trash-stuffed bags and rotten food remnants. One day, we found a plethora of plates, saucers, cups, and bowls strewn all over the dump—the hotel had replaced its dishes and discarded the old ones. We spent the whole day breaking those dishes with rocks or against one another. We discussed nothing, devised no plans; it was clear to us what needed to be done. The dishes were nondescript, beige. We shattered them into smithereens, taking a break for lunch, then smashing some more in the afternoon. We sustained small cuts, but we didn’t care. They were the blisters of toil, the stigmata of devotion. We discovered the pleasure of unbridled, unlimited destruction, the endless joy of converting something into nothing. This was new to us back then. Now it isn’t. Now we know that that was one of the happiest days of our childhood, perhaps of our entire life. And when we went back to the dump, some time later, and found new garbage there, new generations of refuse, we knew that underneath it all were our smithereens, that we could go on forging them for as long as we were alive, that we would always remember the day we first broke the limited whole.","The story is set near a mountain cabin in Jahorina, where there is a hotel called Šator. The hotel is only open during the winter for the skiing season. The narrator, when they were eleven years old, broke into the hotel bar and stole a bottle of blueberry juice. They were caught by a bartender who blackmailed them but ended up telling their parents anyway.

The hotel's cleaning staff consists of a woman named Baja, who spends her days sitting on the hotel balcony, wearing a blue overcoat and a black scarf on her head. She is described as ghost-like and impervious to pain. Baja has a severe toothache that she refuses to treat, resulting in the abscess eventually destroying one of her eyes. Despite her condition, she never seems to clean anything.

Behind the hotel, there is a crested boulder that the narrator and their sister often climb. From the top, they can see a cluster of weekend houses and hear the sounds of construction as the owners prepare for a future of peace and retirement. However, the war would later put an end to their ambitions.

The garbage from the hotel is dumped near the boulder, and the narrator and their sister often explore the trash-filled bags. One day, they find a large number of old dishes that the hotel has discarded. They spend the entire day breaking the dishes, finding joy in the act of destruction. They sustain small cuts but are not bothered by them.

The narrator reflects on how, as children, they believed the world to be fixed and unalterable. Breaking the dishes was a form of liberation and brought them immense happiness. They realize that underneath the new garbage at the dump, their shattered dishes still remain, symbolizing their ability to continue forging their own path.

The story captures a moment from the narrator's childhood, where they find temporary escape and satisfaction in breaking the limited whole, signifying their understanding of the power of destruction and the joy it can bring.","The narrator recalls a summer from their childhood when they broke into the vacant Šator hotel and stole a bottle of blueberry juice.

Where Are You?,Joyce Carol Oates,"The husband had got into the habit of calling the wife from somewhere in the house—if she was upstairs, he was downstairs; if she was downstairs, he was upstairs—and when she answered, “Yes? What?,” he would continue to call her, as if he hadn’t heard and with an air of strained patience: “Hello? Hello? Where are you?” And so she had no choice but to hurry to him, wherever he was, elsewhere in the house, downstairs, upstairs, in the basement or outside on the deck, in the back yard or in the driveway. “Yes?” she called, trying to remain calm. “What is it?” And he would tell her—a complaint, a remark, an observation, a reminder, a query—and then, later, she would hear him calling again with a new urgency, “Hello? Hello? Where are you?,” and she would call back, “Yes? What is it?,” trying to determine where he was. He would continue to call, not hearing her, for he disliked wearing his hearing aid around the house, where there was only the wife to be heard. He complained that one of the little plastic devices in the shape of a snail hurt his ear, the tender inner ear was reddened and had even bled, and so he would call, pettishly, “Hello? Where are you?”—for the woman was always going off somewhere out of the range of his hearing, and he never knew where the hell she was or what she was doing; at times, her very being exasperated him—until finally she gave in and ran breathless to search for him, and when he saw her he said reproachfully, “Where were you? I worry about you when you don’t answer.” And she said, laughing, trying to laugh, though none of this was funny, “But I was here all along!” And he retorted, “No, you were not. You were not. I was here, and you were not here.” And later that day, after his lunch and before his nap, unless it was before his lunch and after his nap, the wife heard the husband calling to her, “Hello? Hello? Where are you?,” and the thought came to her, No. I will hide from him. But she would not do such a childish thing. Instead she stood on the stairs and cupped her hands to her mouth and called to him, “I’m here. I’m always here. Where else would I be?” But the husband couldn’t hear her and continued to call, “Hello? Hello? Where are you?,” until at last she screamed, “What do you want? I’ve told you, I’m here.” But the husband couldn’t hear and continued to call, “Hello? Where are you? Hello!,” and finally the wife had no choice but to give in, for the husband was sounding vexed and angry and anxious. Descending the stairs, she tripped and fell, fell hard, and her neck was broken in an instant, and she died at the foot of the stairs, while in one of the downstairs rooms, or perhaps in the cellar, or on the deck at the rear of the house, the husband continued to call, with mounting urgency, “Hello? Hello? Where are you?”","In this story, a husband and wife have developed a peculiar habit of calling each other from different parts of the house. Whenever the wife answers, the husband continues to call her with an air of strained patience, pretending not to hear her. This forces the wife to hurry to him, no matter where he is in the house or even outside. The husband doesn't like wearing his hearing aid at home because he finds it uncomfortable, so he often doesn't hear the wife calling him. This frustrates him, and he constantly calls out, ""Hello? Hello? Where are you?"" The wife tries to remain calm and asks him what he wants, but he doesn't hear her. Eventually, she gives in and searches for him, only for him to reproach her for not answering sooner.

One day, the wife decides to play a game and hides from her husband, but she quickly dismisses the idea as childish. Instead, she stands on the stairs and calls out to him, assuring him that she is always there. However, the husband still can't hear her and continues to call out, growing increasingly frustrated. The wife screams in frustration, telling him that she is right there, but he still can't hear her. Eventually, feeling anxious and angry, the wife gives in and starts descending the stairs to find him.

Tragically, as she descends the stairs, she trips and falls, breaking her neck instantly and dying at the foot of the stairs. Meanwhile, the husband, still unaware of what has happened, continues to call out to her, oblivious to the tragedy that has unfolded.

The story explores the breakdown of communication and understanding between the husband and wife. The husband's refusal to wear his hearing aid and his constant calls for the wife create tension and frustration. The wife's attempts to reassure him and engage in playful banter ultimately lead to a tragic accident. The story highlights the consequences of their communication struggles and the tragic outcome that arises from their inability to truly connect.","In this story, a husband and wife have a peculiar communication habit. The husband repeatedly calls out for the wife, no matter where she is in the house. Even when she responds, he continues to call her as if he hasn't heard her, demanding to know her location. Frustrated, the wife always rushes to him, trying to remain calm while asking what he needs. The husband, who dislikes wearing his hearing aid at home, complains that it hurts his ear. He believes the wife frequently leaves his hearing range, making him worry about her. One day, the wife decides she will not cater to his constant calls and tries to hide from him. Instead, she stands on the stairs and calls out to him, declaring that she is always there. However, the husband cannot hear her and persists in calling for her. Growing more and more frustrated, the wife screams that she is indeed there, but the husband remains oblivious. Eventually, she gives in to his demands.

Art of Story,John Edgar Wideman,"Two young people, different colors, my color, passed me, crown of her topknot, edges of his fro glow softly above their heads when I first glanced down the street and noticed the couple busy with each other, strides synched, not hurrying, not strolling either, about half a block away walking towards me on Grand, the glow hovered, visible against early-morning light of a clear spring day framing the figures as they approached closer, pavement shadowy under their feet, sky behind them stretching up and up into bluish, then pale cloudless distance, a sky finally no color, all colors, same, different as the glow I’d seen floating atop their heads.

Stories are graves. Empty. Nothing there. All living and dying in them fake. Pretend. No story unless someone reads, tells it. Empty. No one’s time inside a story. Time needed to live and die, to tell stories. But stories not time. Stories graves. No entering or leaving them without time. Nothing breathing inside them. Lost nor found. No time. Only stories. Only words. Pretend words. Pretend time.

Pretend to enter, to leave, to begin. Make yourself believe you create time, are time. Contained by time. Contain time. As if time not a story you make up. Believe. As if time not a word like others you make up to tell a story . . . Once upon a time . . . as if time might end or begin, as if time waits in a story or is something like stories. As if a story contains time, or is contained by time. As if time stops or leaves or catches up or begins in stories. As if words tell time and time listens or reads. As if stories are not graves. Where we play dead. Play with the dead.

As if the something words make of nothing is time. More time. Somewhere. Time and not a story. Not fiction. Not a grave. Make believe somewhere, something saved by telling, listening, reading. A tangible somewhere and time something that might accumulate, count. More time. More than time. Not nothing. Words. Stories. More.

Perhaps, I tell myself, I have one to tell. To listen to. To read. A story does not become something until it ends, until I pretend it’s over and that I am no longer experiencing a walk on Grand Street early in the morning, pretend these words, one after the other, are something like steps, mine, yours, anybody’s, anyone who listens, reads for some reason and perhaps may remember steps, streets, and revisits how a morning materializes from nothing but step after step taken while darkness, brightness unfold and enfold, nothing until you are feeling, speaking one instant, one word after another, the next seeming to follow from the one before, no beginning or end, more steps, more street seeming maybe never to stop, materializing as fast and as solid as missing things suddenly recalled, things striking you as happy, painful, familiar, odd, urgent, though soon enough you also recall that nothing’s there, you are alone as always with your thoughts, always alone even with a busy headful of them, including anybody else’s thoughts, aches, telling stories, pretending time at your fingertips, time ahead as you take step after step along Grand, and where oh where else could you be, where are you headed this morning if not to a physical-therapy appointment at 450 Grand Street and two young people appear together, content, focussed enough on each other to match strides, colored teen-agers or very young adults coming toward you, crowns of soft light outlining hair rising above their skulls, light visible against morning’s brightness, a shimmering that perhaps is source or end or both of vast brightness above them, surrounding them, but when I glance up and notice them, the word mourning somehow came to mind. Mourning’s sadness, and that mourning word mine, yours, the morning mine, yours, but only one. Only once, and anyway, belongs to no one, belongs, fits nowhere, is nothing except word, story, nothing, nowhere, only a story beginning you might find yourself in the midst of unexpectedly, but of course an empty story, over and dead, a true story since they all are true and are not when you tell, listen, read.

Listen. I want to pretend, to believe the glow, the auras seeping from or hovering above the heads of two young people on a Lower East Side street in New York City, U.S.A., April 29, 2018, signify hope eternal, and that light above them is the same immense light I saw framing serried row after row of people not stretching to the horizon, but rows backed up at least as far as where towers, stores, windows and walls of city resumed, even the last row of shimmering crowns ablaze, maybe about to ignite the square and monumental buildings of stone enclosing them, tops of heads glowing, perhaps ready to explode and incinerate the million or so fuzzy bodies indistinguishable one from another of a crowd that had gathered to greet Nelson Mandela coming home after twenty-seven years of imprisonment, crowd whose size, whose hope ungraspable though my visitor’s eyes were present, hungry witnesses peering down from Cape Castle’s balcony on February 11, 1990, in Cape Town, Republic of South Africa. Inextinguishable hope one story I can imagine, maybe tell, even if a different story narrated by helicopter gunships stitching a dark net in air above the square, barricades fortified by tanks and steel rhinos packed with shock troops in camouflage that secured all streets, every entrance and exit from the space of welcoming.

Time unruffled by stops and starts. Entrances, exits. Stories. Two young people pass me. Grand Street unruffled as time. Going nowhere. My steps one after another. Vanishing. Pass two young colored strangers. Remember the square in Cape Town, the teeming, excited crowd in which maybe I last saw them.","The story begins with the narrator observing two young people, one with a crown of hair and the other with a glowing fro, walking towards them on Grand Street. The glow above their heads catches the narrator's attention, and they contemplate the nature of stories and time. The narrator reflects on how stories are like graves, empty until someone reads or tells them, and how time is a construct within these stories. They question whether they have a story to tell, one that can be experienced and remembered by others.

As the narrator continues walking on Grand Street, they recall a memory of a crowd gathered to greet Nelson Mandela after his release from prison. The narrator imagines the immense hope and light shining above the crowd, contrasting it with the presence of helicopter gunships and barricades, symbolizing the struggle and oppression that existed alongside the hope.

The story concludes with the narrator's steps fading away as they pass the two young people on Grand Street, reminiscent of the fleeting nature of time and the transient encounters we have with others. The memory of the crowd in Cape Town lingers, representing the enduring hope that can exist amidst the challenges of life.","The story begins with the narrator observing two young people walking together on a street. The couple's physical features, specifically the glow that surrounds their heads, catches the narrator's attention. The narrator contemplates the nature of stories, likening them to graves that are empty unless someone reads or tells them. They reflect on the idea that time is a construct created through stories and words.

As the narrator continues walking, they ponder the concept of storytelling and how it gives meaning and substance to experiences. They question whether they have a story to tell and acknowledge that a story only becomes something when it ends. The narrator describes their surroundings and the act of walking, emphasizing the fluidity of time and the way one moment seamlessly transitions into another.

Suddenly, the narrator notices the two young people approaching them on the street. Their glow reminds the narrator of mourning, evoking a sense of sadness. However, they also want to believe that the glow represents eternal hope. They recall a past experience in Cape Town, South Africa, where they witnessed a large crowd waiting to welcome Nelson Mandela after his release from imprisonment. The narrator imagines the same immense light from that event enveloping the young couple.

The story concludes with the narrator reminiscing about the unpredictability of time, entrances, exits, and stories. They pass by the two young people, reflecting on the potential connection between their current encounter and the past experience in Cape Town.",s5
Sun Dogs,Dorthe Nors,"It’s a long time ago now, but once I lived in a cabin in Norway. It was Olav who mentioned the place to me, at the start of our relationship. He told me that it’d been the summer cottage of the Norwegian author Knut Terje Aasbakken. Now it served as a writer’s retreat, and a narrow lane led up to it from the village Olav was from. As a child, he’d spy on the writers. They seemed so secretive, he said, and dived into me.

After our relationship began to get complicated, a friend suggested I go away somewhere. So it was that I remembered Aasbakken’s cabin. The one on a mountainside, in a forest.

I applied, got the cabin, and left at the beginning of September. A woman from the general store drove me from the village. She talked about the area as we crept up the mountain in her little Golf. On the way, we passed the community center. She said it was customary for whoever was in the cabin to give a reading in the center. I gazed down on the river in the valley, and then she dropped me off with a key to the woodshed.

Evenings, I’d take a chair out in front of the cabin and try to stay there till I was shaking from the cold. In the mornings, I read, wrote zip. Late in the day I’d take a walk. And then one day I found myself at a standstill in front of the community-center notice board. “BUNADS,” the heading read, and under it was the name of Olav’s mother. She was called Halldis and taught the locals to sew their own folk costumes.

The days lasted an eternity, and at night the cold moved in. I walked around Aasbakken’s house and picked paint from the cabinet doors. Out in the forest, the mushrooms poked up, and it was impossible to escape the reading event in the community center. One evening in October, I positioned myself against a large loom-woven tapestry. During the coffee break, a woman with short dark hair and a face like an Inuit’s came over. She said, “I think you’ve met my son. He lives in Copenhagen.” I must have stared. “I’ve got an article he’s written about you,” she said.

In that way, I became sort of friends with Olav’s mother, Halldis. We agreed to go on some walks together. Later we also went out riding on her Fjord horses. She talked about the landscape, the kinds of tracks animals left, and how the winter we were entering would feel. We never spoke of Olav. It was my impression that she was a strong person, but at regular intervals she’d worry about whether I’d write about her.

One day in early November, we took the horses into the forest. When we came to a clearing, I said that the vista would make for a good opening scene. She said, “Yes, that’s what I’m so afraid of.”

I thought of Olav, his face and hers, and that might’ve been the day she invited me home for coffee. In any case, I remember that we let the horses loose in the pasture and sat in the kitchen. There were pictures of Olav and his wife on the bulletin board, and I’m sure that I gave Halldis a hug when I left.

Despite the awkwardness in our relationship, we kept seeing each other. One day when we were in the kitchen, Olav’s father came in. He sat down at the table reluctantly, as we probably didn’t want to be disturbed. Halldis found him a coffee cup, and of course he was disturbing us. I recall him saying that he didn’t care for well-educated people. He was a carpenter, Olav’s father. Said that the hand’s labor was important and pointed to the table. I praised the table, and then I had to go and see his workshop.

We walked out to it, all three, and what I remember most clearly was that he’d stuck up a photo of a naked woman with a thumbtack. He’d pinned her up over the door to the room where Halldis worked on her costumes. That meant that Halldis had to walk under the naked woman anytime she went in and did her sewing. You never know about other people’s relationships, but I thought to myself that it was their marriage Halldis didn’t want me to write about. It seemed complicated to me, though I think it seemed healthy to her.

Every day she passed beneath the naked woman who hung over the door with her legs slightly spread, and she’d hung there so long that Halldis no longer noticed her. She was no doubt thinking of her son in Copenhagen. His wife was beautiful and industrious. He interviewed famous authors. And now one of them was living in Aasbakken’s cabin.

The cabin had no phone, so I ended up getting a letter. I have it still. He was angry, Olav. “I wouldn’t have thought it of you,” he wrote.

In that sense, he wasn’t like his mother. I can recall another time we rode out together. It was a clear fall morning. On the outward part of our route, we rode past a lake. To me, Norwegian lakes feel bottomless, the landscape unknowable. Such uncertainty must leave its mark on the locals, I thought. Later, we went in among the trees, where it smelled of fungus and rot.

As we rode, we talked about how the forest looked lovely in its decay. I told her she resembled an Inuit, and that Olav must have got his features from her. She smiled at that, and there were birds of prey aloft, and moss upon the massive trunks of spruce, and I drank in everything I saw.

Then one day, when we were drinking coffee in the kitchen and her husband came in, wanting attention, she actually began to tell a story. She looked at Olav’s father, asked him, “Do I dare to tell this?” and he said, “Yes, just tell it.”

At first I thought she asked him whether she should tell the story because it was his, or because he decided which stories could be told in their relationship. In any case, she began telling it, though at times she’d put a hand over her mouth. “No, I don’t know if I dare,” she said, glancing from her husband down into her cup.

The story concerned her cousin who had been married to a bad man.

It wasn’t until the man was dead that the cousin discovered just how bad he’d been. It came out from the estate and certain letters found with it. “But you mustn’t write this story,” she said. She shouldn’t be worried, I said. “Your cousin’s husband wasn’t so out of the ordinary.” She asked, did I know such men? I said that now and then I ran into one. She asked if I wrote about them. “Sometimes,” I said.

I have the impression that during the time we spent together she managed to read my books. She mentioned one in particular. It had become winter, we were in the forest, and the surroundings creaked with snow and ice. She’d read the book but didn’t quite know what to think of it. She found the indecisiveness of the female protagonist especially hard to bear.

We crawled over an old stone wall. The sun was shining; my eyes hurt from all the whiteness. Recently, I saw an old photo from the gold-mining town of Yellowknife, near the Arctic Circle. It was a picture of an Inuit and then the sun, and the sun wasn’t alone. It had company. It’s an optical phenomenon—the sun’s light is refracted by ice crystals and two bright points appear, one on either side. Under the picture it said that the sun had been joined by its rivals, the ones that in the language of the prairie were called sun dogs.

“What exactly are you afraid I’m going to write about?” I asked her. “I don’t know,” she said.

She stood there and the light went right through her, that’s the way I remember it.

How the sun caused her physical form to cease. On the broad white expanse she cast a sharp shadow and I stood opposite her, not alone.

“Halldis?” I said.

She tugged at her mittens, nodded.","The narrator reflects on their relationship with Olav, who had suggested they stay in a cabin in Norway that used to belong to a famous author.

Let’s Say,Linor Goralik,". . . Let’s say the leader of a children’s book club is discussing Ray Bradbury’s “All Summer in a Day” with a group of nice, smart little seven-year-olds. They’re talking crime and punishment. “Just imagine,” says the teacher, “two kids are beating up a third, whom you don’t know, right in front of you. What do you do?” “Say something! Get a grownup! Run for help!” “Good,” says the teacher. “Now picture one of your classmates, someone you really don’t like. Ready? So you’re walking along, and you see two kids beating up that unpleasant child. What do you do?” A moment of silence. The teacher’s heart begins to soar. Someone says timidly, “Well, um, shouldn’t you still, like…” Someone else notes confidently that the girl in question probably “deserves it.” And only one little girl, sitting ramrod straight, says firmly, “You have to get in there and chase them away, of course!” And, before the teacher, brimming with joy, can open his mouth, she adds, “And then you finish her off yourself!” Once he’s caught his breath, the teacher asks: “Katya, but you wouldn’t have hit that girl in the first place, right? So why now?” “Well, she’s strong, usually,” says clear-eyed Katya. “But now she’s probably tired herself out!”

 . . . Let’s say X., an engineer and a fantastic Israeli father, decides to make his two-year-old kiddo some traditional Hanukkah doughnuts from scratch. Not those floppy, enormous store-bought doughnuts with all that crap inside, but cute, chubby little doughnuts with homemade jam and handcrafted powdered sugar. He works his ass off in the kitchen for like twelve hours. The kiddo looks at the dish of doughnuts and, without touching them, says firmly: “I don’t like it,” then goes off to do her own thing. In his mind, X. says some strongly worded things about girls as a concept, eats two platefuls of chubby little doughnuts, and succumbs to several hours of moral and physical melancholy. The next day, he goes to pick up the kiddo from the Hanukkah party at her day care. He finds her sitting on the floor next to another kiddo. That kiddo is licking damp powdered sugar off some crumbly store-bought doughnuts and handing them off to our kiddo, who consumes each one with great enthusiasm. X. tries to convince himself that the issue was the powdered sugar, but his wounded soul cries out for justice. “Why is this happening to me, Mama?” he asks his mother that evening. “It’s because of the dumplings,” his mother says. Turns out that, in early childhood, X. refused to touch the homemade dumplings that his mother spent all night lovingly preparing for him. But, at other people’s houses, he was perfectly happy to eat crumbling store-bought dumplings from a cardboard box. He’d bite into them, pick out the meat and nibble at the dough, then carefully eat the grayish meat with a specially requested spoon, gazing at his dear mother with innocent eyes.

 . . . Let’s say a little boy, hanging on his mother’s arm right in the middle of Moscow’s Rizhskaya Station, says in a confidential whisper: “Mama, I don’t wanna be the person you’re raising me to be anymore. I want to scream in the metrooooooooo-aaaaaaaaaaa!”

 . . . Let’s say that in the home of F., a prize-winning poet, lives an aged nanny. The nanny has been with the family through thick and thin, surviving famine, terror, German occupation, evacuation, thaw, stagnation, and perestroika. She raised the poet’s grandfather, father, uncles, the poet himself, his sisters, children, and grandchildren, and is even now shouting affectionately at the poet’s small great-grandchildren from her seat of honor. This saintly woman was always exceptionally attentive to the lives of others and willing to listen to any kind of story: about famine, terror, German occupation, evacuation, thaw, stagnation, perestroika, and so on. But, at the end of every story, she had only one question: “So, did he get away?” This greatly impressed the guests of prize-winning poet F. “It’s the whole story of the Russian people in a single question!” said K., an artist. “Why just the Russian people?” objected Z., a choreographer. “It’s the whole story of the Jewish people in a single question!” “Oh, please,” answered the artist K. “The whole story of the Jewish people is contained in the question: ‘So, did anyone get away?’ ” The nanny, who had survived famine, terror, German occupation, evacuation, thaw, stagnation, and perestroika sat in her corner and was silent.

 . . . Let’s say G., an anxious writer, periodically becomes convinced that he has wronged his loved ones in some terrible way, and that, as a result, they now hate him. So writer G. occasionally calls his loved ones to say something like, “Please don’t hate me because I forgot to return your pen yesterday,” or, “Please don’t hate me for eating the last apple three days ago,” and so on. Meanwhile, it’s November—seasonal affective disorder and all that—and pretty soon G.’s friends are getting several of these calls a day. On and on, until G. receives a letter from his loved ones: “Dear G.! Don’t worry, we don’t need a reason to hate you.” Sixteen signatories, two anonymous.

 . . . Let’s say C., a translator, found an excellent way to solve his children’s problems. Or, rather, to get his children to solve their own problems. Anytime they started whining and trying to foist their issues on him, C. would say, pensively: “Why should I, an adult human, pick up the Legos scattered all over the floor?” “Why should I, an adult human, struggle to get a plum out from under the tub?” “Why should I, an adult human, watch ‘Up’ for the fourth time?” (Actually, this was a separate problem, because translator C. actively fears “Up,” a film about death and loneliness—but why should he, an adult human, have to explain all that to some little pissants?) And so, in the couple of months since he enacted this strategy, his children, to translator C.’s delight, have not only stopped harassing him so much, but have actually evolved (in his opinion) into much more independent people. They stuff their Legos into the bag of rice all by themselves; whatever’s rolled under the tub stays there, smelling great; they stream “Up” all by themselves and non-consensually tell Daddy all about it by themselves, too. So translator C. starts recommending his system to everyone he knows. Then, one day, he walks into the bathroom, and there’s his seven-year-old son P., lying in the empty tub with his eyes closed, mumbling: “Why should I, an adult human, have to think about any of this? Well, why should I?” And translator C. starts to feel a little sick—but it’s too late now, isn’t it.","In this collection of vignettes, the author presents various scenarios that explore human behavior and relationships. In the first story, a teacher engages children in a discussion about intervening in a situation where someone is being bullied. One girl suggests intervening and then finishing off the victim herself, highlighting the complexity of human nature and the potential for cruelty even in young children.

The second story revolves around a father's attempt to make homemade doughnuts for his child, only to be rejected in favor of store-bought ones. This leads him to reflect on his own childhood rejection of his mother's homemade dumplings. The story explores the dynamics of taste preferences, the influence of childhood experiences, and the intergenerational nature of relationships.

The third story features a little boy expressing his desire to break free from societal expectations and scream in the metro. This anecdote delves into the theme of personal freedom and the longing to rebel against societal norms.

The fourth story centers around an aged nanny who has witnessed and survived various historical events. Despite her experiences, her only concern is whether the protagonist of each story she hears managed to escape or not. This simple question raises deeper questions about the nature of suffering and survival.

The fifth story follows an anxious writer who constantly fears that he has upset his loved ones. He repeatedly calls them to apologize for trivial matters, leading to a letter from his friends telling him that they don't need a reason to hate him. This story delves into the themes of anxiety, self-doubt, and the fragility of relationships.

The final story revolves around a translator who employs a strategy of refusing to solve his children's problems, prompting them to become more independent. However, this strategy backfires when his son adopts the same attitude towards life, causing the translator to question the consequences of his actions. This story explores parenting, the balance between independence and support, and the unintended consequences of our choices.

Overall, these stories offer insights into the complexities of human behavior, relationships, and the consequences of our actions.","In this collection of fictional scenarios, the author explores different moments and situations that reveal unexpected aspects of human nature and relationships.

In the first scenario, a group of seven-year-olds in a book club discuss the concept of crime and punishment. The teacher presents a hypothetical situation where two children are beating up a third, unknown child. The children respond with suggestions to intervene and seek help. However, when the scenario involves a disliked classmate, most children justify the violence. Only one girl, Katya, firmly believes in intervening to stop the beating. When questioned by the teacher, she explains that she believes the disliked girl is usually strong but is likely tired from the fight.

The second scenario revolves around X., a father, who spends twelve hours making homemade Hanukkah doughnuts for his two-year-old child. However, the child instantly rejects the doughnuts, causing X. to feel disheartened. The next day, X. discovers his child happily eating store-bought doughnuts at a Hanukkah party. X. recalls how, as a child, he refused to eat his mother's homemade dumplings but gladly ate store-bought ones elsewhere. X. realizes that his child's preference for store-bought doughnuts may be similar to his own preference for store-bought dumplings as a child.

In the third scenario, a little boy expresses his frustration to his mother, stating that he no longer wants to be the person she is raising him to be. He desires to scream in the metro, displaying a rebellious urge.

In the fourth scenario, an aged nanny who has cared for multiple generations of a poet's family is known for asking, ""So, did he get away?"" after hearing stories of struggle and survival. This question impresses guests, some attributing it to the entire Russian people, while others relate it to the Jewish people. The nanny, who has experienced various historical events, remains silent in contemplation.

The fifth scenario follows an anxious writer named G. who constantly believes he has wronged his loved ones and apologizes excessively for minor things. His friends reach a point where they send him a letter, expressing that they don't need a reason to hate him. Sixteen people sign the letter, while two signatures remain anonymous.

In the final scenario, a translator named C. discovers a strategy to encourage his children to solve their own problems. Whenever his children complain or ask for his help, C. responds by questioning why he, as an adult, should do certain tasks. This tactic leads his children to become more independent. However, C. later finds his son lying in an empty tub, repeating C.'s phrases and questioning why he should have to think about anything. C. feels a sense of unease, realizing the potential negative impact of his strategy.

Overall, these scenarios shed light on the complexities of human behavior, the influence of past experiences, and the dynamics within relationships and parenting.",s7
Citizen Punch,Robert Coover,"Citizen Punch, sitting under his humped back and sugarloaf hat on the lip of the little stage, his floppy legs dangling, is performing for the rowdy seaside audience below him. “Life is shit,” he says with his peculiar wheezle.

“Yay!” they yell.

“People are better off dead!”

“Yay!”

“Give me your money!” he says. They do.

He loves his audience. They love him. But he hates them, too. They’re people, and people are mostly disgusting. Sometimes he wants to hit them so hard that he can watch their heads spin. Pow! Bash! Whirr! So hard that they never recover. Ka-BLAM! No loss. They’re stupid arse-kissers at best. But they do adore his arse, which he bares from time to time, taking pleasure in their adoration. “It’s your best feature,” the foxy Professor tells him, helping him display it. Looks like a knuckled fist, and is sometimes used as one. BOP! Sur-PRISE! He adores it, too. It’s when the dummies are puckered up at his knuckled backside that he feels closest to them. Gives them his happy face to show his appreciation, make them feel good.

Not everybody loves him back. There are always a few rotten barrels in every apple, as the Professor says. No problem. His people take care of them. “That’s the way to do it!” Punch tells them. “Total losers! Throw ’em the hell outa here!” His people hate do-gooders as much as he does. “We all know life’s just a joke,” he squawks, “but those patsies think it has meaning! They’ll never get the gag, not even when they’re hit by the punch line. Lay it on! Bigly!”

“How’s that, Mr. Punch?” It’s the Bottler. The Bottler is his fixer. Every honest man needs one. He beats on his big tin drum and tootles his pipes and works the yokels, squeezing them for cash. A genius. “Are you telling jokes again?”

“Yes, Bottler, I’m talking about the tragedy of life.”

“Ha ha, that’s a good one! You always break me up, Mr. Punch!”

“Believe me! Life’s the worst deal ever, Bottler! It’s an outrage! Shouldn’t be allowed! But, when you get snookered and there’s nobody to sue, all you can do is jump into the muck and swing your slapstick, bust a few heads, have as much fun as you can before the show closes! No one wins, but, like the Professor says, bullies last longest!”

“A beautiful credo, Mr. Punch! You are, as everybody says, a philosopher, a visionary, and a true disbeliever!”

“I am also a fighter, as you know. The world has done us no favors. It’s been against us from the start. We gotta get tough, take it apart, eat it up!”

“Truer words were never uttered, Mr. Punch. Listen to all your fans! They’re applauding you!”

“I know. They love my eloquence, my smarts. And they’re so generous! The suckers have nothing, and it’s like they can’t give me enough. Now, go take up a collection!”

Judy drops by with Baby. She can be a very nasty woman, Judy. From time to time, he has to belt her one. Give her credit, she always belts him back, the ugly beak-nosed bitch. They say he has a dick for a nose, but so does Judy. Gender equality! As for Baby, Punch doesn’t know how he begat the little shit machine, but Judy assures him that he did. She asks him now to mind the brat while she gets her snarly hair tarted up. That’s an invitation to toss squalling Baby out the window. “YI-I-i-i-iii!” He has the kid on a string, hauls her back up, throws her out the window again. Listen to her scream! He loves it! The crowd loves it!

Judy doesn’t. She’s gone to yell at the authorities about him, and now the scowling Doctor is standing where she was. The Doctor tells Punch that he belongs in the madhouse. He is mentally unbalanced. To prove it, the Doctor wraps his flabby arms around a slapstick as big as he is and—pow!—knocks Punch head over heels into the wings. Punch springs back, snatches the slapstick, and—“Unbalanced, my ass, baldy!” he yelps—smacks the Doctor with it. The Doctor’s an old guy; it’s easy. Laughing, Punch whacks him again. And again. Once more. He’s dead.

A brass-buttoned, red-nosed Constable turns up while he’s still pummeling the dead Doctor and tells Punch that he’s under arrest. “You’re breaking the law,” he says. What a laugh!

“Let’s see what else gets broken,” Punch cackles gleefully and lays into the Bobby with his stick. Ka-whack! WHAM! The Bobby’s helmet head cracks open, but he picks himself up and hits Punch with a subpoena. Punch hits him with a subpoena. Biff! Boff! He’s got the Bobby on the ropes! The crowd’s loving it! They shout out encouragement, and Punch pauses to take a bow. The broken-headed Bobby, on his dangling feet, swings his massive cudgel with both arms. The crowd tries to warn Punch, but too late—thwock! Punch is down. The Constable safety-pins Punch’s floppy hands to his pants and hauls him off to stand trial.

The Judge in his white wig calls for testimony from the victims. Pretty Polly says that Punch raped her. Joey the Clown says the same, and so does Crocodile.

“Guilty!” the Judge announces gravely, bringing his gavel down. “Citizen Punch must hang for his diabolical crimes!”

The crowd cheers at that. What? Then, when Punch asks the court for mercy, the Judge responds by rapping Punch’s head with his gavel—knock! knock! The crowd on the beach whoops it up. The traitors! After all he’s done for them! It’s not fair!

And now here comes the hooded Hangman to carry out the Judge’s sentence! Not a nice fellow. The crowd agrees. No one loves a hangman. The Hangman throws the noose over Punch’s head, but he ducks away. “It’s too small!” Punch cries out in his kazoo-like voice, as the noose bounces off him.

“It fits all customers,” the Hangman insists.

“No, look, it’s too small even for you!” Punch squawks.

The Hangman shows Punch that he’s wrong by dropping the noose over his own head, and Punch kicks him off the stage, hanging the Hangman! Punch has the howling crowd once more in the palm of his hand. But that hand is pinned to his britches.

The Judge himself comes to complete the grim ceremony. Judy’s there as a witness, along with Joey the Clown, loose-jointed old Jim Crow, Toby the Dog, loudmouth Mr. Scaramouche, and the Bobby, looking smug under his yawning helmet.

While the Judge is looping the noose over Punch’s head, his white wig falls off: It’s the Devil himself! Grinning like a no-see-no-hear monkey! The Devil is greeted by the fickle crowd below with friendly boos and laughter. He smiles his wicked smile and says, “Hello, Mr. Punch. And goodbye, Mr. Punch.”

“Wait, Your Honor! I don’t care if you hang me—life’s nothing more than a dirty joke, good riddance—but I have to pray to my Maker, and I can’t do that with my hands pinned to my arse.”

“Since when have you become religious, Mr. Punch?”

“Since the day I first saw you, Your Honor, a model for all honest thieves. The Almighty props me up, fingers me where it feels good, I’d be limp as a rag without him, but you’re the one who fondles my black heart!”

The Devil, flattered, relents. “No tricks now, Mr. Punch!”

Punch, freed, grabs up a slapstick and wallops him with it. The Devil laughs off the blow and fights back with fire and brimstone. Punch turns his stick into a cricket bat and swats the stinking brimstone back at the Devil. The Devil’s judicial robes catch fire, and he shrinks away inside them, shrieking obscenities.

Punch surveys the bleating lowlifes ringed around him on the beach, cheering, laughing, waiting for the next act, but their whoops sound fake, their howls of laughter hollow. Some are even turning away, as if to say they’ve seen it all before. Sad. Punch is disillusioned. He works his ass off, beating up on everybody, sending them all to Hell or worse, and no one shows him the least appreciation. What’s it all for?

The Professor doesn’t know but tells him that he can’t quit. “Life’s a scam,” he says, “but there’s nothing to do, except make shit up and carry on. See how rich you can get, who you can fuck over. Nothing else matters.”

Punch can feel the Professor getting into his head, tickling the doubts away. Grinning again his hawkish grin, he picks up his slapstick.

“That’s the way to do it!” the Bottler says, working the crowds at his feet. “Uh-oh! Look out, Mr. Punch! Ha ha! Here comes Judy!”","Citizen Punch is a performer who entertains a rowdy seaside audience with his dark and cynical humor. He believes that life is terrible and people are disgusting, but he loves the adoration of his audience. With the help of his fixer, the Bottler, Punch collects money from his fans and encourages them to embrace the absurdity of life. However, not everyone appreciates his act, and Judy, his partner, often clashes with him. Punch takes care of their baby, but he secretly fantasizes about harming the child. When Judy leaves to complain about him to the authorities, the Doctor confronts Punch and accuses him of being mentally unbalanced. In response, Punch kills the Doctor and attacks a constable who tries to arrest him. The constable eventually subdues Punch and takes him to court, where he is found guilty of various crimes. The crowd cheers as the judge sentences Punch to hang. During the execution, it is revealed that the judge is actually the Devil. Punch manages to free himself and fights back against the Devil, eventually defeating him. However, Punch becomes disillusioned with his audience as he realizes that their appreciation is superficial. The Professor encourages him to continue living and making the most out of life, even if it is a scam.

He mocks them for being gullible while also basking in their adoration. His fixer, the Bottler, supports his comedic act and helps him collect money from the audience. Punch believes that life is a joke and those who think otherwise are fools, and he encourages his followers to be tough and merciless. Judy, Punch's partner, arrives with their child, Baby, and asks Punch to watch the baby while she gets ready. Punch takes the opportunity to playfully toss Baby out the window, enjoying the crowd's reaction. However, Judy becomes angry and leaves to report him to the authorities.

In Judy's absence, the Doctor confronts Punch, suggesting that he is mentally unbalanced. Punch retaliates by violently attacking and ultimately killing the Doctor. A constable arrives and attempts to arrest Punch, but he fights back, brutally assaulting the constable as well. Punch is arrested and brought to trial, where several victims accuse him of rape and other crimes. He pleads for mercy, but the judge, who is revealed to be the Devil, denies his request and mocks him. As the hangman prepares to execute Punch, the Devil intervenes, intrigued by Punch's mention of praying to his Maker. Punch convinces the Devil to release him and then attacks the Devil with a slapstick, causing the Devil's robes to catch fire.

After defeating the Devil, Punch realizes that the crowd, although initially entertained, is now unimpressed and turning away. He questions the purpose of his violent acts if they are not appreciated. The Professor encourages him to keep going, emphasizing that life is a scam and that success and manipulation are what matter. Punch, swayed by the Professor's words, picks up his slapstick once again, ready to continue his performance. The Bottler jokes about Judy's arrival, suggesting that Punch's turbulent relationship with her will provide more material for his act.",s8
An Evening with Joseph Conrad,Anne Carson,"Joseph Conrad gave a reading at the London Library. A red-haired woman came up afterward. He had seen her circling earlier, taking a chair at the back, but he had not troubled about it. “I knew you in the Congo,” she said now. “I knew your wife.” My wife? he thought, but, as always after a reading, in the retreating roar of his own soul he could barely hear her or remember how English worked. Had she said “life,” not “wife”? Her voice, that of a crow, thrust at him—some weekend they’d “all spent together” and he’d sent her a letter the next day, a poem. Dread rose at the back of his mind; a parcel broke. He turned away, busied himself. He blamed, abhorred the touch of a past time; it surprised him how much. She followed him to the dinner that Charles (the London Librarian) had arranged at a nearby bistro, hurrying along behind everyone else, and, with the touch of his wife or his life burning like a toxin on his inside skin, Joseph Conrad could not meet her eyes or let pathos come clouding into him. When she seated herself at the foot of the table and was speaking loudly to anyone who listened, he felt the pluck of it on the side of his head but did not turn, he had to continue, now he’d begun, it was a long dinner. It was unjust. In other contexts, he admired perseverance. She was drowning. He did not turn. The light of pure reason, Joseph Conrad liked to say, resembles electricity in being cold. Proud statements like this came to him now and again when he was swimming but afterward seemed a bit off. No, it was a little nightmare, it was a rescue he could not carry out (and he was a rescuer).

But eventually the dinner ended. It was still 1907. No one had drowned. Shrugging into coats, they said hearty farewell things. He did not catch her eye. All left together to walk back toward the Library and go their ways. It was an early winter night. He began to feel fundamentally impatient with himself, hot with cowardice. He dropped back to walk beside her. His heartbeat was too fast. She did not seem surprised. An unknownness enveloped them, as if they were playing a game, as if they were draped in cloth or lost in old rooms. How they got to talking about white bread he could not remember afterward, but it shone in his mind, this conversation, as the bread had shone, and he was trying to tell her all that. Maybe she had mentioned lining up for bread in the early-morning dusk, sent out by her mother, running home with a loaf as heavy as two schoolbooks. When one dreamed of bread even now, Joseph Conrad agreed with her, it was not the rough black bread of childhood. Dream bread, mythic bread, was as white as a freshly laundered cuff.

Once, he had gone from London to visit his homeland and been invited to a christening in the countryside. It was June. On the drive, the weather closed in, matte gray and vague, typical summer weather for that region. The ceremony was as usual, in a tiny white church, where everyone sat packed like teeth and listened to short, glorious off-key songs sung by a ten-year-old girl, who was the sister of the new baby. The sun came out. Everyone rushed from the church. They stood amid graves, talking, amazed. Vast general fields reached away on every side to the mountains. He recalled the feeling of being a small mark at the center of a greenness so dazzlingly revealed it hurt the eyes. Soon, they embarked in cars and drove to a nearby farmhouse for lunch, sunlight still spilling over everything.

The farmhouse stood with all doors open, children tumbling in and out, busy conversation everywhere. He knew scarcely anyone, so stood in an inner room, mastering it in case he would one day write about it, near a table draped in a lace cloth and heavy with cakes. There was a cake as big as two schoolbooks—he smilingly used her analogy—emblazoned with the name of the new baby. A chocolate cake shaped like a bear and full of candies that erupted for the children. Many fluffy cream cakes and several tall block-like structures layered with red jam. There were also other smaller foods, shrimp on crackers and so forth, and, finally, carried in late with a sort of hasty deference, on its own blue-patterned china plate, a stack of sliced white bread. The plate was placed, as it happened, in a shaft of sunlight, and the white bread shone, in its own piety, on the lace in that shadowy room, set into the history of a sunlit afternoon on an ancient property amid fields stretching to the ends of the mind.

No one ate the white bread. It wasn’t there to be eaten. It was a chapter of civilization. He had lived that chapter and so had she, this red-haired woman, in the poor places and poor childish times when a glowing heap of crispy loaves in a shop window was twice as radiant as the rubies or diamonds on display at the jeweller’s down the street. The two of them stood in front of the London Library, tossed out of memory, dazed by the sexual nearness of something ultimate. An adoration without hope. She was starting to say something about metaphors, metaphors being also real, which didn’t interest him. He was feeling his pockets for the small notebook where he liked to record thoughts but had left it back at the hotel. He pulled himself around him and escaped.","Joseph Conrad, a renowned author, is giving a reading at the London Library. Afterward, a red-haired woman approaches him and claims to have known him in the Congo and his wife as well. Conrad is confused and tries to distance himself from her, feeling a sense of dread. She follows him to a dinner arranged by the London Librarian, where she loudly speaks to anyone who will listen. Conrad tries to ignore her, feeling impatient and cowardly. Eventually, the dinner ends, and Conrad feels guilty for his actions. He walks beside the woman, and they engage in a conversation about white bread, which holds a significant meaning for both of them. Conrad recalls a memory of a christening in his homeland and the sight of a farmhouse filled with cakes and a stack of sliced white bread that no one ate. The white bread symbolizes a chapter of civilization that they both experienced in their impoverished past. Overwhelmed by the sexual tension between them, Conrad searches for his notebook but leaves without it, escaping the situation.","The story begins with Joseph Conrad giving a reading at the London Library. After the reading, a red-haired woman approaches him and claims to have known him and his wife in the Congo. Confused by her words, Conrad tries to ignore her and busies himself with other things. However, the woman follows him to a dinner arranged by Charles, the London Librarian.

Throughout the dinner, Conrad feels uncomfortable and tries to avoid the woman's gaze. He admires her perseverance but can't bring himself to engage with her. As the dinner ends, Conrad feels impatient and cowardly. He decides to walk with the woman back to the library, feeling a sense of unknownness between them.

During their conversation, Conrad recalls a memory of attending a christening in his homeland. He describes the stunning scenery and the feeling of being immersed in the beauty of nature. He then relates this memory to the woman's comment about white bread, emphasizing the significance of white bread in their childhoods.

Conrad remembers a moment at the christening where a plate of sliced white bread was placed in sunlight, illuminating the room. The white bread symbolizes a chapter of civilization and evokes a sense of nostalgia for both Conrad and the woman. Standing in front of the library, they feel a sexual tension but also a sense of adoration without hope.

The woman begins to discuss metaphors, but Conrad, feeling overwhelmed, searches for his notebook and realizes he left it at the hotel. He quickly pulls himself away from the conversation and makes his escape.",s9
The South Asian Speakers Series Presents the Archeologist and Adventurer Indiana Jones,Tania James,"“But, if you ask me,” Indiana Jones said, “it belongs in a museum.”

He paused to let that sink in.

He was sitting onstage across from the moderator, an Indian woman whose name he’d failed to catch. Her legs were crossed at the knee. (The legs he’d remember.) He reached for the glass of water on the tiny table between them and sipped.

The moderator uncrossed her legs and shifted to face the audience. “Let’s pause here and take some questions.”

He followed her gaze to the masses, overflowing into the aisles, lined up along the walls. For the first time that evening, he tried to distinguish faces. Many of them were colored. Faces of color. Not a bad thing. His best friend was Egyptian.

A microphone was passed to the first questioner, a brown-skinned man. “Thank you for your talk, Dr. Jones. I’m wondering about the Indian village, the one that sent you on your quest to retrieve a mystical stone.”

“The Sankara stone, correct. The villagers sent me to retrieve it and save their kidnapped children from a demonic cult.”

“I was just wondering what the village was called.”

“I don’t remember.”

“You don’t remember?”

“I’d just ridden a raft down a waterfall. You’ll forgive me if I don’t remember the name of the village.” Indy grinned in a way that he hoped was charming.

“I believe it was Mayapore?” the moderator filled in, consulting her notes.

“That’s it, Mayapore,” Indy said. “And the leader of the village was named Shaman.”

“Shaman,” the questioner said. “Just . . . Shaman.”

“Correct.”

“So if I went to this Mayapore and went around asking for a guy named Shaman, people would be, like, yeah, Shaman lives over on, I dunno, Cherokee Street.”

“Look, pal, I don’t know what your problem is—”

“My problem is that all these names sound made up.”

“All names are made up. Hey, I was named after my pet dog!”

Some people laughed. Indy prompted the next question.

It came from a pretty woman in a clingy skirt. “Hi, Dr. Jones,” she said, and, as she went on, he found himself recalling a student, a girl, from his teaching days. “You mentioned that, at the Maharajah’s banquet, you were served a dessert of chilled monkey brains?”

He nodded, still thinking of the student who used to sit in the front row of his history class. Once, on her eyelids, she’d written him a message. “Love” on the right lid, and “You” on the left.

“Some say this idea of Asians eating monkey brains is an urban legend, based on a misunderstanding of the Chinese hóu tóu gū, which translates to ‘monkey-head mushroom.’ Could it be that you ate monkey-head-mushroom soup? It’s a Manchurian dish.”

Indy recalled the way his former student had closed and opened her eyes. Love you. Love you. It was sort of disgusting to think of her writing on her own eyelids. But kind of amazing, too. What wouldn’t she do?

“Dr. Jones?” the questioner said.

Indy looked to the moderator, who was also looking at him, illegibly. “I just ate what I was told to eat,” he said.

Silence. He took a long gulp of water.

The world had grown unfriendly to his form of research. What he wouldn’t give to be back in the jungles of Honduras or jumping trains across Nazi-occupied Europe, where he could let his whip do the talking. He’d taken this gig for the honorarium, mainly.

For the final question, the moderator pointed to a tiny woman with billowing black hair. “Mr. Jones,” she said, already annoying him, for he had a Ph.D. “How would you respond to the claim that you’re more of a grave robber than an archeologist? And is there merit to the argument that these relics belong not in European museums but in the places they’ve been looted from?”

“You know what?” Indy said. “I have a coupla questions. Have you been whipped and force-fed the blood of Kali? Have you been crippled by a voodoo doll? I did all that, not for myself but for the villagers of that village and their children. I’m the good guy here, not the bad guy.”

“Dr. Jones,” the moderator said, “the question had to do with looted objects—”

“Well, guess what, joke’s on you. . . .” His voice trailed off. He was thinking of the Holy Grail, the cup of the king of kings, falling out of his grasp, tumbling into a chasm beneath the Temple of the Sun. And wasn’t it always like that? Hadn’t every object he’d ever loved finally eluded him, vanishing even further into the vault of history? Quietly he said, “I’ve never put anything in a museum.”

He looked at the floor. The general murmur was excruciating.

Eventually, he heard the gentle voice of the moderator: “Indiana . . . Indiana . . .”

Her tone sounded so much like his father’s right then. He looked into her warm brown eyes.

“Indy, we brought you here to talk.”

“I am talking.”

“No, so that we could talk to you.” She gave him a sympathetic smile. “Indy, the truth is that many of us find you very heroic and very sexy. But this India mission is confusing. On the one hand, we’re flattered. On the other hand, we’re angry. It’s just a circle that’s hard to square, you know?”

Indy sighed; he knew. Things had gotten weird in India. Deep down, he had always known.

“Can we agree, Indy, that India was a misstep? That you should stick to fighting Nazis?”

“Theoretically, sure, but the Nazi party is defunct.”

“And yet there are still Nazis. There will always be Nazis.”

He frowned, suspicious. As he looked out at the audience, he could see waves of nodding faces, confirming the ever-presence of Nazis. His gaze fixed on the red exit sign, glowing like the fiery Sankara stone.

“Well, then,” he said, “I guess I’ve got work to do.”

He reached down beneath his chair and retrieved the fedora he’d stored behind his ankles all this time, the hat that had seen him through every adventure, and set it on his head. He got up and jogged sideways down the stairs. As he made his way down the center aisle, people began to clap, uncertainly at first. It didn’t matter. He was grateful. They had saved him.","Indiana Jones is the main character in this story. He is participating in a Q&A session where he is asked about his adventures and the artifacts he has recovered.

Town of Cats,Haruki Murakami,"At Koenji Station, Tengo boarded the Chuo Line inbound rapid-service train. The car was empty. He had nothing planned that day. Wherever he went and whatever he did (or didn’t do) was entirely up to him. It was ten o’clock on a windless summer morning, and the sun was beating down. The train passed Shinjuku, Yotsuya, Ochanomizu, and arrived at Tokyo Central Station, the end of the line. Everyone got off, and Tengo followed suit. Then he sat on a bench and gave some thought to where he should go. “I can go anywhere I decide to,” he told himself. “It looks as if it’s going to be a hot day. I could go to the seashore.” He raised his head and studied the platform guide.

At that point, he realized what he had been doing all along.

He tried shaking his head a few times, but the idea that had struck him would not go away. He had probably made up his mind unconsciously the moment he boarded the Chuo Line train in Koenji. He heaved a sigh, stood up from the bench, and asked a station employee for the fastest connection to Chikura. The man flipped through the pages of a thick volume of train schedules. He should take the 11:30 special express train to Tateyama, the man said, and transfer there to a local; he would arrive at Chikura shortly after two o’clock. Tengo bought a Tokyo-Chikura round-trip ticket. Then he went to a restaurant in the station and ordered rice and curry and a salad.

Going to see his father was a depressing prospect. He had never much liked the man, and his father had no special love for him, either. He had retired four years earlier and, soon afterward, entered a sanatorium in Chikura that specialized in patients with cognitive disorders. Tengo had visited him there no more than twice—the first time just after he had entered the facility, when a procedural problem required Tengo, as the only relative, to be there. The second visit had also involved an administrative matter. Two times: that was it.

The sanatorium stood on a large plot of land by the coast. It was an odd combination of elegant old wooden buildings and new three-story reinforced-concrete buildings. The air was fresh, however, and, aside from the roar of the surf, it was always quiet. An imposing pine grove formed a windbreak along the edge of the garden. And the medical facilities were excellent. With his health insurance, retirement bonus, savings, and pension, Tengo’s father could probably spend the rest of his life there quite comfortably. He might not leave behind any sizable inheritance, but at least he would be taken care of, for which Tengo was tremendously grateful. Tengo had no intention of taking anything from him or giving anything to him. They were two separate human beings who had come from—and were heading toward—entirely different places. By chance, they had spent some years of life together—that was all. It was a shame that it had come to that, but there was absolutely nothing that Tengo could do about it.

Tengo paid his check and went to the platform to wait for the Tateyama train. His only fellow-passengers were happy-looking families heading out for a few days at the beach.

Most people think of Sunday as a day of rest. Throughout his childhood, however, Tengo had never once viewed Sunday as a day to enjoy. For him, Sunday was like a misshapen moon that showed only its dark side. When the weekend came, his whole body began to feel sluggish and achy, and his appetite would disappear. He had even prayed for Sunday not to come, though his prayers were never answered.

When Tengo was a boy, his father was a collector of subscription fees for NHK—Japan’s quasi-governmental radio and television network—and, every Sunday, he would take Tengo with him as he went door to door soliciting payment. Tengo had started going on these rounds before he entered kindergarten and continued through fifth grade without a single weekend off. He had no idea whether other NHK fee collectors worked on Sundays, but, for as long as he could remember, his father always had. If anything, his father worked with even more enthusiasm than usual, because on Sundays he could catch the people who were usually out during the week.

Tengo’s father had several reasons for taking him along on his rounds. One reason was that he could not leave the boy at home alone. On weekdays and Saturdays, Tengo could go to school or to day care, but these institutions were closed on Sundays. Another reason, Tengo’s father said, was that it was important for a father to show his son what kind of work he did. A child should learn early on what activity was supporting him, and he should appreciate the importance of labor. Tengo’s father had been sent out to work in the fields on his father’s farm, on Sunday like any other day, from the time he was old enough to understand anything. He had even been kept out of school during the busiest seasons. To him, such a life was a given.

Tengo’s father’s third and final reason was a more calculating one, which was why it had left the deepest scars on his son’s heart. Tengo’s father was well aware that having a small child with him made his job easier. Even people who were determined not to pay often ended up forking over the money when a little boy was staring up at them, which was why Tengo’s father saved his most difficult routes for Sunday. Tengo sensed from the beginning that this was the role he was expected to play, and he absolutely hated it. But he also felt that he had to perform it as cleverly as he could in order to please his father. If he pleased his father, he would be treated kindly that day. He might as well have been a trained monkey.

Tengo’s one consolation was that his father’s beat was fairly far from home. They lived in a suburban residential district outside the city of Ichikawa, and his father’s rounds were in the center of the city. At least he was able to avoid doing collections at the homes of his classmates. Occasionally, though, while walking in the downtown shopping area, he would spot a classmate on the street. When this happened, he ducked behind his father to keep from being noticed.

On Monday mornings, his school friends would talk excitedly about where they had gone and what they had done the day before. They went to amusement parks and zoos and baseball games. In the summer, they went swimming, in the winter skiing. But Tengo had nothing to talk about. From morning to evening on Sundays, he and his father rang the doorbells of strangers’ houses, bowed their heads, and took money from whoever came to the door. If people didn’t want to pay, his father would threaten or cajole them. If they tried to talk their way out of paying, his father would raise his voice. Sometimes he would curse at them like stray dogs. Such experiences were not the sort of thing that Tengo could share with friends. He could not help feeling like a kind of alien in the society of middle-class children of white-collar workers. He lived a different kind of life in a different world. Luckily, his grades were outstanding, as was his athletic ability. So even though he was an alien he was never an outcast. In most circumstances, he was treated with respect. But whenever the other boys invited him to go somewhere or to visit their homes on a Sunday he had to turn them down. Soon, they stopped asking.

Born the third son of a farming family in the hardscrabble Tohoku region, Tengo’s father had left home as soon as he could, joining a homesteaders’ group and crossing over to Manchuria in the nineteen-thirties. He had not believed the government’s claims that Manchuria was a paradise where the land was vast and rich. He knew enough to realize that “paradise” was not to be found anywhere. He was simply poor and hungry. The best he could hope for if he stayed at home was a life on the brink of starvation. In Manchuria, he and the other homesteaders were given some farming implements and small arms, and together they started cultivating the land. The soil was poor and rocky, and in winter everything froze. Sometimes stray dogs were all they had to eat. Even so, with government support for the first few years they managed to get by. Their lives were finally becoming more stable when, in August, 1945, the Soviet Union launched a full-scale invasion of Manchuria. Tengo’s father had been expecting this to happen, having been secretly informed of the impending situation by a certain official, a man he had become friendly with. The minute he heard the news that the Soviets had violated the border, he mounted his horse, galloped to the local train station, and boarded the second-to-last train for Da-lien. He was the only one among his farming companions to make it back to Japan before the end of the year.

After the war, Tengo’s father went to Tokyo and tried to make a living as a black marketeer and as a carpenter’s apprentice, but he could barely keep himself alive. He was working as a liquor-store deliveryman in Asakusa when he bumped into his old friend the official he had known in Manchuria. When the man learned that Tengo’s father was having a hard time finding a decent job, he offered to recommend him to a friend in the subscription department of NHK, and Tengo’s father gladly accepted. He knew almost nothing about NHK, but he was willing to try anything that promised a steady income.

At NHK, Tengo’s father carried out his duties with great gusto. His foremost strength was his perseverance in the face of adversity. To someone who had barely eaten a filling meal since birth, collecting NHK fees was not excruciating work. The most hostile curses hurled at him were nothing. Moreover, he felt satisfaction at belonging to an important organization, even as one of its lowest-ranking members. His performance and attitude were so outstanding that, after a year as a commissioned collector, he was taken directly into the ranks of the full-fledged employees, an almost unheard-of achievement at NHK. Soon, he was able to move into a corporation-owned apartment and join the company’s health-care plan. It was the greatest stroke of good fortune he had ever had in his life.

Young Tengo’s father never sang him lullabies, never read books to him at bedtime. Instead, he told the boy stories of his actual experiences. He was a good storyteller. His accounts of his childhood and youth were not exactly pregnant with meaning, but the details were lively. There were funny stories, moving stories, and violent stories. If a life can be measured by the color and variety of its episodes, Tengo’s father’s life had been rich in its own way, perhaps. But when his stories touched on the period after he became an NHK employee they suddenly lost all vitality. He had met a woman, married her, and had a child—Tengo. A few months after Tengo was born, his mother had fallen ill and died. His father had raised him alone after that, while working hard for NHK. The End. How he happened to meet Tengo’s mother and marry her, what kind of woman she was, what had caused her death, whether her death had been an easy one or she had suffered greatly—Tengo’s father told him almost nothing about such matters. If he tried asking, his father just evaded the questions. Most of the time, such questions put him in a foul mood. Not a single photograph of Tengo’s mother had survived.

Tengo fundamentally disbelieved his father’s story. He knew that his mother hadn’t died a few months after he was born. In his only memory of her, he was a year and a half old and she was standing by his crib in the arms of a man other than his father. His mother took off her blouse, dropped the straps of her slip, and let the man who was not his father suck on her breasts. Tengo slept beside them, his breathing audible. But, at the same time, he was not asleep. He was watching his mother.

This was Tengo’s photograph of his mother. The ten-second scene was burned into his brain with perfect clarity. It was the only concrete information he had about her, the one tenuous connection his mind could make with her. He and she were linked by this hypothetical umbilical cord. His father, however, had no idea that this vivid scene existed in Tengo’s memory, or that, like a cow in a meadow, Tengo was endlessly regurgitating fragments of it to chew on, a cud from which he obtained essential nutrients. Father and son: each was locked in a deep, dark embrace with his own secrets.

As an adult, Tengo often wondered if the young man sucking on his mother’s breasts in his vision was his biological father. This was because Tengo in no way resembled his father, the stellar NHK collections agent. Tengo was a tall, strapping man with a broad forehead, a narrow nose, and tightly balled ears. His father was short and squat and utterly unimpressive. He had a small forehead, a flat nose, and pointed ears like a horse’s. Where Tengo had a relaxed and generous look, his father appeared nervous and tightfisted. Comparing the two of them, people often openly remarked on their dissimilarity.

Still, it was not their physical features that made it difficult for Tengo to identify with his father but their psychological makeup. His father showed no sign at all of what might be called intellectual curiosity. True, having been born in poverty he had not had a decent education. Tengo felt a degree of pity for his father’s circumstances. But a basic desire to obtain knowledge—which Tengo assumed to be a more or less natural urge in people—was lacking in the man. He had a certain practical wisdom that enabled him to survive, but Tengo could discern no hint of a willingness in his father to deepen himself, to view a wider, larger world. Tengo’s father never seemed to suffer discomfort from the stagnant air of his cramped little life. Tengo never once saw him pick up a book. He had no interest in music or movies, and he never took a trip. The only thing that seemed to interest him was his collection route. He would make a map of the area, mark it with colored pens, and examine it whenever he had a spare moment, the way a biologist might study chromosomes.

Tengo, by contrast, was curious about everything. He absorbed knowledge from a broad range of fields with the efficiency of a power shovel scooping earth. He had been regarded as a math prodigy from early childhood, and he could solve high-school math problems by the time he was in third grade. Math was, for young Tengo, an effective means of retreat from his life with his father. In the mathematical world, he would walk down a long corridor, opening one numbered door after another. Each time a new spectacle unfolded before him, the ugly traces of the real world would simply disappear. As long as he was actively exploring that realm of infinite consistency, he was free.

While math was like a magnificent imaginary building for Tengo, literature was a vast magical forest. Math stretched infinitely upward toward the heavens, but stories spread out before him, their sturdy roots stretching deep into the earth. In this forest there were no maps, no doorways. As Tengo got older, the forest of story began to exert an even stronger pull on his heart than the world of math. Of course, reading novels was just another form of escape—as soon as he closed the book, he had to come back to the real world. But at some point he noticed that returning to reality from the world of a novel was not as devastating a blow as returning from the world of math. Why was that? After much thought, he reached a conclusion. No matter how clear things might become in the forest of story, there was never a clear-cut solution, as there was in math. The role of a story was, in the broadest terms, to transpose a problem into another form. Depending on the nature and the direction of the problem, a solution might be suggested in the narrative. Tengo would return to the real world with that suggestion in hand. It was like a piece of paper bearing the indecipherable text of a magic spell. It served no immediate practical purpose, but it contained a possibility.

The one possible solution that Tengo was able to decipher from his readings was this one: My real father must be somewhere else. Like an unfortunate child in a Dickens novel, Tengo had perhaps been led by strange circumstances to be raised by this impostor. Such a possibility was both a nightmare and a great hope. After reading “Oliver Twist,” Tengo plowed through every Dickens volume in the library. As he travelled through Dickens’s stories, he steeped himself in reimagined versions of his own life. These fantasies grew ever longer and more complex. They followed a single pattern, but with infinite variations. In all of them, Tengo would tell himself that his father’s home was not where he belonged. He had been mistakenly locked in this cage, and someday his real parents would find him and rescue him. Then he would have the most beautiful, peaceful, and free Sundays imaginable.

Tengo’s father prided himself on his son’s excellent grades, and boasted of them to people in the neighborhood. At the same time, however, he showed a certain displeasure with Tengo’s brightness and talent. Often when Tengo was at his desk, studying, his father would interrupt him, ordering the boy to do chores or nagging him about his supposedly offensive behavior. The content of his father’s nagging was always the same: here he was, running himself ragged every day, covering huge distances and enduring people’s curses, while Tengo did nothing but take it easy all the time, living in comfort. “They had me working my tail off when I was your age, and my father and older brothers would beat me black and blue for anything at all. They never gave me enough food. They treated me like an animal. I don’t want you thinking you’re so special just because you got a few good grades.”

This man is envious of me, Tengo began to think at a certain point. He’s jealous, either of me as a person or of the life I’m leading. But would a father really feel jealousy toward his son? Tengo did not judge his father, but he could not help sensing a pathetic kind of meanness emanating from his words and deeds. It was not that Tengo’s father hated him as a person but, rather, that he hated something inside Tengo, something that he could not forgive.

When the train left Tokyo Station, Tengo took out the paperback that he had brought along. It was an anthology of short stories on the theme of travel and it included a tale called “Town of Cats,” a fantastical piece by a German writer with whom Tengo was not familiar. According to the book’s foreword, the story had been written in the period between the two World Wars.

In the story, a young man is travelling alone with no particular destination in mind. He rides the train and gets off at any stop that arouses his interest. He takes a room, sees the sights, and stays for as long as he likes. When he has had enough, he boards another train. He spends every vacation this way.

One day, he sees a lovely river from the train window. Gentle green hills line the meandering stream, and below them lies a pretty little town with an old stone bridge. The train stops at the town’s station, and the young man steps down with his bag. No one else gets off, and, as soon as he alights, the train departs.

No workers man the station, which must see very little activity. The young man crosses the bridge and walks into the town. All the shops are shuttered, the town hall deserted. No one occupies the desk at the town’s only hotel. The place seems totally uninhabited. Perhaps all the people are off napping somewhere. But it is only ten-thirty in the morning, far too early for that. Perhaps something has caused all the people to abandon the town. In any case, the next train will not come until the following morning, so he has no choice but to spend the night here. He wanders around the town to kill time.

In fact, this is a town of cats. When the sun starts to go down, many cats come trooping across the bridge—cats of all different kinds and colors. They are much larger than ordinary cats, but they are still cats. The young man is shocked by this sight. He rushes into the bell tower in the center of town and climbs to the top to hide. The cats go about their business, raising the shop shutters or seating themselves at their desks to start their day’s work. Soon, more cats come, crossing the bridge into town like the others. They enter the shops to buy things or go to the town hall to handle administrative matters or eat a meal at the hotel restaurant or drink beer at the tavern and sing lively cat songs. Because cats can see in the dark, they need almost no lights, but that particular night the glow of the full moon floods the town, enabling the young man to see every detail from his perch in the bell tower. When dawn approaches, the cats finish their work, close up the shops, and swarm back across the bridge.

By the time the sun comes up, the cats are gone, and the town is deserted again. The young man climbs down, picks one of the hotel beds for himself, and goes to sleep. When he gets hungry, he eats some bread and fish that have been left in the hotel kitchen. When darkness approaches, he hides in the bell tower again and observes the cats’ activities until dawn. Trains stop at the station before noon and in the late afternoon. No passengers alight, and no one boards, either. Still, the trains stop at the station for exactly one minute, then pull out again. He could take one of these trains and leave the creepy cat town behind. But he doesn’t. Being young, he has a lively curiosity and is ready for adventure. He wants to see more of this strange spectacle. If possible, he wants to find out when and how this place became a town of cats.

On his third night, a hubbub breaks out in the square below the bell tower. “Hey, do you smell something human?” one of the cats says. “Now that you mention it, I thought there was a funny smell the past few days,” another chimes in, twitching his nose. “Me, too,” yet another cat says. “That’s weird. There shouldn’t be any humans here,” someone adds. “No, of course not. There’s no way a human could get into this town of cats.” “But that smell is definitely here.”

The cats form groups and begin to search the town like bands of vigilantes. It takes them very little time to discover that the bell tower is the source of the smell. The young man hears their soft paws padding up the stairs. That’s it, they’ve got me! he thinks. His smell seems to have roused the cats to anger. Humans are not supposed to set foot in this town. The cats have big, sharp claws and white fangs. He has no idea what terrible fate awaits him if he is discovered, but he is sure that they will not let him leave the town alive.

Three cats climb to the top of the bell tower and sniff the air. “Strange,” one cat says, twitching his whiskers, “I smell a human, but there’s no one here.”

“It is strange,” a second cat says. “But there really isn’t anyone here. Let’s go and look somewhere else.”

The cats cock their heads, puzzled, then retreat down the stairs. The young man hears their footsteps fading into the dark of night. He breathes a sigh of relief, but he doesn’t understand what just happened. There was no way they could have missed him. But for some reason they didn’t see him. In any case, he decides that when morning comes he will go to the station and take the train out of this town. His luck can’t last forever.

The next morning, however, the train does not stop at the station. He watches it pass by without slowing down. The afternoon train does the same. He can see the engineer seated at the controls. But the train shows no sign of stopping. It is as though no one can see the young man waiting for a train—or even see the station itself. Once the afternoon train disappears down the track, the place grows quieter than ever. The sun begins to sink. It is time for the cats to come. The young man knows that he is irretrievably lost. This is no town of cats, he finally realizes. It is the place where he is meant to be lost. It is another world, which has been prepared especially for him. And never again, for all eternity, will the train stop at this station to take him back to the world he came from.

Tengo read the story twice. The phrase “the place where he is meant to be lost” attracted his attention. He closed the book and let his eyes wander across the drab industrial scene passing by the train window. Soon afterward, he drifted off to sleep—not a long nap but a deep one. He woke covered in sweat. The train was moving along the southern coastline of the Boso Peninsula in midsummer.

One morning when he was in fifth grade, after much careful thinking, Tengo declared that he was going to stop making the rounds with his father on Sundays. He told his father that he wanted to use the time for studying and reading books and playing with other kids. He wanted to live a normal life like everybody else.

Tengo said what he needed to say, concisely and coherently.

His father, of course, blew up. He didn’t give a damn what other families did, he said. “We have our own way of doing things. And don’t you dare talk to me about a ‘normal life,’ Mr. Know-It-All. What do you know about a ‘normal life’?” Tengo did not try to argue with him. He merely stared back in silence, knowing that nothing he said would get through to his father. Finally, his father told him that if he wouldn’t listen then he couldn’t go on feeding him. Tengo should get the hell out.

Tengo did as he was told. He had made up his mind. He was not going to be afraid. Now that he had been given permission to leave his cage, he was more relieved than anything else. But there was no way that a ten-year-old boy could live on his own. When his class was dismissed at the end of the day, he confessed his predicament to his teacher. The teacher was a single woman in her mid-thirties, a fair-minded, warmhearted person. She heard Tengo out with sympathy, and that evening she took him back to his father’s place for a long talk.

Tengo was told to leave the room, so he was not sure what they said to each other, but finally his father had to sheathe his sword. However extreme his anger might be, he could not leave a ten-year-old boy to wander the streets alone. The duty of a parent to support his child was a matter of law.

As a result of the teacher’s talk with his father, Tengo was free to spend Sundays as he pleased. This was the first tangible right that he had ever won from his father. He had taken his first step toward freedom and independence.

At the reception desk of the sanatorium, Tengo gave his name and his father’s name.

The nurse asked, “Have you by any chance notified us of your intention to visit today?” There was a hard edge to her voice. A small woman, she wore metal-framed glasses, and her short hair had a touch of gray.

“No, it just occurred to me to come this morning and I hopped on a train,” Tengo answered honestly.

The nurse gave him a look of mild disgust. Then she said, “Visitors are supposed to notify us before they arrive to see a patient. We have our schedules to meet, and the wishes of the patient must also be taken into account.”

“I’m sorry. I didn’t know.”

“When was your last visit?”

“Two years ago.”

“Two years ago,” she said as she checked the list of visitors with a ballpoint pen in hand. “You mean to say that you have not made a single visit in two years?”

“That’s right,” Tengo said.

“According to our records, you are Mr. Kawana’s only relative.”

“That is correct.”

She glanced at Tengo, but she said nothing. Her eyes were not blaming him, just checking the facts. Apparently, Tengo’s case was not exceptional.

“At the moment, your father is in group rehabilitation. That will end in half an hour. You can see him then.”

“How is he doing?”

“Physically, he’s healthy. It’s in the other area that he has his ups and downs,” she said, tapping her temple with an index finger.

Tengo thanked her and went to wait in the lounge by the entrance, reading more of his book. A breeze passed through now and then, carrying the scent of the sea and the cooling sound of the pine windbreak outside. Cicadas clung to the branches of the trees, screeching their hearts out. Summer was at its height, but the cicadas seemed to know that it would not last long.

Eventually, the bespectacled nurse came to tell Tengo that he could see his father now. “I’ll show you to his room,” she said. Tengo got up from the sofa and, passing by a large mirror on the wall, realized for the first time what a sloppy outfit he was wearing: a Jeff Beck Japan Tour T-shirt under a faded dungaree shirt with mismatched buttons, chinos with specks of pizza sauce near one knee, a baseball cap—no way for a thirty-year-old son to dress on his first hospital visit to his father in two years. Nor did he have anything with him that might serve as a gift on such an occasion. No wonder the nurse had given him that look of disgust.

Tengo’s father was in his room, sitting in a chair by the open window, his hands on his knees. A nearby table held a potted plant with several delicate yellow flowers. The floor was made of some soft material to prevent injury in case of a fall. Tengo did not realize at first that the old man seated by the window was his father. He had shrunk—“shrivelled up” might be more accurate. His hair was shorter and as white as a frost-covered lawn. His cheeks were sunken, which may have been why the hollows of his eyes looked much bigger than they had before. Three deep creases marked his forehead. His eyebrows were extremely long and thick, and his pointed ears were larger than ever; they looked like bat wings. From a distance, he seemed less like a human being than like some kind of creature, a rat or a squirrel—a creature with some cunning. He was, however, Tengo’s father—or, rather, the wreckage of Tengo’s father. The father that Tengo remembered was a tough, hardworking man. Introspection and imagination might have been foreign to him, but he had his own moral code and a strong sense of purpose. The man Tengo saw before him was nothing but an empty shell.

“Mr. Kawana!” the nurse said to Tengo’s father in the crisp, clear tone she must have been trained to use when addressing patients. “Mr. Kawana! Look who’s here! It’s your son, here from Tokyo!”

Tengo’s father turned in his direction. His expressionless eyes made Tengo think of two empty swallow’s nests hanging from the eaves.

“Hello,” Tengo said.

His father said nothing. Instead, he looked straight at Tengo as if he were reading a bulletin written in a foreign language.

“Dinner starts at six-thirty,” the nurse said to Tengo. “Please feel free to stay until then.”

Tengo hesitated for a moment after the nurse left, and then approached his father, sitting down in the chair opposite his—a faded, cloth-covered chair, its wooden parts scarred from long use. His father’s eyes followed his movements.

“How are you?” Tengo asked.

“Fine, thank you,” his father said formally.

Tengo did not know what to say after that. Toying with the third button of his dungaree shirt, he turned his gaze toward the pine trees outside and then back again to his father.

“You have come from Tokyo, is it?” his father asked.

“Yes, from Tokyo.”

“You must have come by express train.”

“That’s right,” Tengo said. “As far as Tateyama. Then I transferred to a local for the trip here to Chikura.”

“You’ve come to swim?” his father asked.

“I’m Tengo. Tengo Kawana. Your son.”

The wrinkles in his father’s forehead deepened. “A lot of people tell lies because they don’t want to pay their NHK subscription fee.”

“Father!” Tengo called out to him. He had not spoken the word in a very long time. “I’m Tengo. Your son.”

“I don’t have a son,” his father declared.

“You don’t have a son,” Tengo repeated mechanically.

His father nodded.

“So what am I?” Tengo asked.

“You’re nothing,” his father said with two short shakes of the head.

Tengo caught his breath. He could find no words. Nor did his father have any more to say. Each sat in silence, searching through his own tangled thoughts. Only the cicadas sang without confusion, at top volume.

He may be speaking the truth, Tengo thought. His memory may have been destroyed, but his words are probably true.

“What do you mean?” Tengo asked.

“You are nothing,” his father repeated, his voice devoid of emotion. “You were nothing, you are nothing, and you will be nothing.”

Tengo wanted to get up from his chair, walk to the station, and go back to Tokyo then and there. But he could not stand up. He was like the young man who travelled to the town of cats. He had curiosity. He wanted a clearer answer. There was danger lurking, of course. But if he let this opportunity escape he would have no chance to learn the secret about himself. Tengo arranged and rearranged words in his head until at last he was ready to speak them. This was the question he had wanted to ask since childhood but could never quite manage to get out: “What you’re saying, then, is that you are not my biological father, correct? You are telling me that there is no blood connection between us, is that it?”

“Stealing radio waves is an unlawful act,” his father said, looking into Tengo’s eyes. “It is no different from stealing money or valuables, don’t you think?”

“You’re probably right.” Tengo decided to agree for now.

“Radio waves don’t come falling out of the sky for free like rain or snow,” his father said.

Tengo stared at his father’s hands. They were lined up neatly on his knees. Small, dark hands, they looked tanned to the bone by long years of outdoor work.

“My mother didn’t really die of an illness when I was little, did she?” Tengo asked slowly.

His father did not answer. His expression did not change, and his hands did not move. His eyes focussed on Tengo as if they were observing something unfamiliar.

“My mother left you. She left you and me behind. She went off with another man. Am I wrong?”

His father nodded. “It is not good to steal radio waves. You can’t get away with it, just doing whatever you want.”

This man understands my questions perfectly well. He just doesn’t want to answer them directly, Tengo thought.

“Father,” Tengo addressed him. “You may not actually be my father, but I’ll call you that for now because I don’t know what else to call you. To tell you the truth, I’ve never liked you. Maybe I’ve even hated you most of the time. You know that, don’t you? But, even supposing that there is no blood connection between us, I no longer have any reason to hate you. I don’t know if I can go so far as to be fond of you, but I think that at least I should be able to understand you better than I do now. I have always wanted to know the truth about who I am and where I came from. That’s all. If you will tell me the truth here and now, I won’t hate you anymore. In fact, I would welcome the opportunity not to have to hate you any longer.”

Tengo’s father went on staring at him with expressionless eyes, but Tengo felt that he might be seeing the tiniest gleam of light somewhere deep within those empty swallow’s nests.

“I am nothing,” Tengo said. “You are right. I’m like someone who’s been thrown into the ocean at night, floating all alone. I reach out, but no one is there. I have no connection to anything. The closest thing I have to a family is you, but you hold on to the secret. Meanwhile, your memory deteriorates day by day. Along with your memory, the truth about me is being lost. Without the aid of truth, I am nothing, and I can never be anything. You are right about that, too.”

“Knowledge is a precious social asset,” his father said in a monotone, though his voice was somewhat quieter than before, as if someone had reached over and turned down the volume. “It is an asset that must be amassed in abundant stockpiles and utilized with the utmost care. It must be handed down to the next generation in fruitful forms. For that reason, too, NHK needs to have all your subscription fees and—”

He cut his father short. “What kind of person was my mother? Where did she go? What happened to her?”

His father brought his incantation to a halt, his lips shut tight.

His voice softer now, Tengo went on, “A vision often comes to me—the same one, over and over. I suspect it’s not so much a vision as a memory of something that actually happened. I’m one and a half years old, and my mother is next to me. She and a young man are holding each other. The man is not you. Who he is I have no idea, but he is definitely not you.”

His father said nothing, but his eyes were clearly seeing something else—something not there.

“I wonder if I might ask you to read me something,” Tengo’s father said in formal tones after a long pause. “My eyesight has deteriorated to the point where I can’t read books anymore. That bookcase has some books. Choose any one you like.”

Tengo got up to scan the spines of the volumes in the bookcase. Most of them were historical novels set in ancient times when samurai roamed the land. Tengo couldn’t bring himself to read his father some musty old book full of archaic language.

“If you don’t mind, I’d rather read a story about a town of cats,” Tengo said. “It’s in a book that I brought to read myself.”

“A story about a town of cats,” his father said, savoring the words. “Please read that to me, if it is not too much trouble.”

Tengo looked at his watch. “It’s no trouble at all. I have plenty of time before my train leaves. It’s an odd story. I don’t know if you’ll like it.”

Tengo pulled out his paperback and started reading slowly, in a clear, audible voice, taking two or three breaks along the way to catch his breath. He glanced at his father whenever he stopped reading but saw no discernible reaction on his face. Was he enjoying the story? He could not tell.

“Does that town of cats have television?” his father asked when Tengo had finished.

“The story was written in Germany in the nineteen-thirties. They didn’t have television yet back then. They did have radio, though.”

“Did the cats build the town? Or did people build it before the cats came to live there?” his father asked, speaking as if to himself.

“I don’t know,” Tengo said. “But it does seem to have been built by human beings. Maybe the people left for some reason—say, they all died in an epidemic of some sort—and the cats came to live there.”

His father nodded. “When a vacuum forms, something has to come along to fill it. That’s what everybody does.”

“That’s what everybody does?”

“Exactly.”

“What kind of vacuum are you filling?”

His father scowled. Then he said with a touch of sarcasm in his voice, “Don’t you know?”

“I don’t know,” Tengo said.

His father’s nostrils flared. One eyebrow rose slightly. “If you can’t understand it without an explanation, you can’t understand it with an explanation.”

Tengo narrowed his eyes, trying to read the man’s expression. Never once had his father employed such odd, suggestive language. He always spoke in concrete, practical terms.

“I see. So you are filling some kind of vacuum,” Tengo said. “All right, then, who is going to fill the vacuum that you have left behind?”

“You,” his father declared, raising an index finger and thrusting it straight at Tengo. “Isn’t it obvious? I have been filling the vacuum that somebody else made, so you will fill the vacuum that I have made.”

“The way the cats filled the town after the people were gone.”

“Right,” his father said. Then he stared vacantly at his own outstretched index finger as if at some mysterious, misplaced object.

Tengo sighed. “So, then, who is my father?”

“Just a vacuum. Your mother joined her body with a vacuum and gave birth to you. I filled that vacuum.”

Having said that much, his father closed his eyes and closed his mouth.

“And you raised me after she left. Is that what you’re saying?”

After a ceremonious clearing of his throat, his father said, as if trying to explain a simple truth to a slow-witted child, “That is why I said, ‘If you can’t understand it without an explanation, you can’t understand it with an explanation.’ ”

Tengo folded his hands in his lap and looked straight into his father’s face. This man is no empty shell, he thought. He is a flesh-and-blood human being with a narrow, stubborn soul, surviving in fits and starts on this patch of land by the sea. He has no choice but to coexist with the vacuum that is slowly spreading inside him. Eventually, that vacuum will swallow up whatever memories are left. It is only a matter of time.

Tengo said goodbye to his father just before 6 P.M. While he waited for the taxi to come, they sat across from each other by the window, saying nothing. Tengo had many more questions he wanted to ask, but he knew that he would get no answers. The sight of his father’s tightly clenched lips told him that. If you couldn’t understand something without an explanation, you couldn’t understand it with an explanation. As his father had said.

When the time for him to leave drew near, Tengo said, “You told me a lot today. It was indirect and often hard to grasp, but it was probably as honest and open as you could make it. I should be grateful for that.”

Still his father said nothing, his eyes fixed on the view like a soldier on guard duty, determined not to miss the signal flare sent up by a savage tribe on a distant hill. Tengo tried looking out along his father’s line of vision, but all that was out there was the pine grove, tinted by the coming sunset.

“I’m sorry to say it, but there is virtually nothing I can do for you—other than to hope that the process forming a vacuum inside you is a painless one. I’m sure you have suffered a lot. You loved my mother as deeply as you knew how. I do get that sense. But she left, and that must have been hard on you—like living in an empty town. Still, you raised me in that empty town.”

A pack of crows cut across the sky, cawing. Tengo stood up, went over to his father, and put his hand on his shoulder. “Goodbye, Father. I’ll come again soon.”

With his hand on the doorknob, Tengo turned around one last time and was shocked to see a single tear escaping his father’s eye. It shone a dull silver color under the ceiling’s fluorescent light. The tear crept slowly down his cheek and fell onto his lap. Tengo opened the door and left the room. He took a cab to the station and reboarded the train that had brought him here.","Tengo, feeling aimless, decides to visit his father at a sanatorium in Chikura.

Courage,Daniel Smith,"People were braver than he was. He was sure of it. He was kind and smart in his way, but he was not brave, and he never had been.

He and his wife had lunch with her sister and her new husband. The husband’s daughter came to lunch, too. She was the youngest of his three children, and she had recently walked the Appalachian Trail, all of it, from Maine to Georgia. Now she was moving to Wyoming to work on a cattle ranch. Her father didn’t mind this, but her mother, her grandparents, and even some of her friends objected strongly. The girl didn’t seem to care. She said that at first she had cared but then she saw that they were only jealous of her willingness to do what she wanted, free of expectations, and then she didn’t care anymore. She was twenty-one.

He thought of himself at twenty-one. Where had he been? He had been in college. Then he had graduated and begun to work, at a drug clinic. In the summer between college and working he went to study Italian at an immersion program in Vermont, but he was lonely and intimidated, and he left after three days. He thought of his wife’s sister’s husband’s daughter’s decision not to care what people thought of her. She had described it as a sort of switch: first she had cared, then she had not cared. The switch was her will. He could not remember ever applying his will to such drastic effect, particularly about other people and their feelings about him. This, he decided, was the essence of her courage and of his cowardice.

That night, while undressing, he tried to explain all this to his wife. She understood him immediately, but she raised a number of objections and mitigating forces.

1.) The girl was overstating or misrepresenting her experience. She very likely did care what other people thought of her—especially her mother—and was portraying her transformation as stark only because it was a) more dramatic to speak that way, b) more self-aggrandizing to speak that way, and c) a means of convincing herself of her own courage, without which she would not be able to do what she was doing.

2.) The girl was not known, given the stories her sister told about her, to be especially generous or compassionate, whereas by all reports he always had been, and these qualities—generosity and compassion—entailed their own form of courage: the courage to serve others. (At this he winced.)

3.) At the time he had grown anxious and homesick and left the language school, his mother had been deathly ill, a detail that ought to soften his judgment of himself. It was important to consider context.

He thanked her, this woman who loved him and who didn’t judge him for those parts of himself that most troubled and shamed him, but he offered counterarguments to which he believed she would have no effective response.

1.) Even if the girl was misrepresenting herself in order to bolster her spirits, this was, as he saw it, further evidence of her courage—courage consisting, as everyone knew, not of action in the absence of objections but action in the face of them.

2.) Selfishness was its own form of courage, and in fact was, within reason, exactly the kind of courage that he had in mind.

3.) Many people had mothers who were dying and then died. A dying mother does not preclude the study of Italian. There are always excuses.

They lay in bed. They could hear two men on the sidewalk talking and laughing. They kissed for a while. It seemed that they were going to make love but they didn’t, and as his wife slept he thought about the girl. What would she do on the ranch in Wyoming? Would she drive steer? Would she cook and clean? He had meant to ask her but then the conversation had turned. Was she frightened at all? Did she have reservations? What resources of mind or spirit did she think she possessed to move to a place two thousand miles from her family, a place in which she knew nobody and the terrain and climate were utterly different from those which she had always known? If she grew lonely, what comforts would she seek out? And did she love herself? Under the great sweeping Western sky, among the cattle and the mountains bathed in red light, was it really herself whom she loved most of all?","The protagonist of the story reflects on his own lack of bravery compared to others. He and his wife have lunch with her sister and her new husband, and their husband's daughter, who is the youngest of three children. The daughter shares that she recently walked the entire Appalachian Trail and is now moving to Wyoming to work on a cattle ranch. While her father is supportive, her mother, grandparents, and some friends object to her decision. The daughter explains that she no longer cares about others' expectations and believes they are just jealous of her willingness to do what she wants. The protagonist thinks about his own life at her age, realizing that he has never applied his will in such a drastic way. He considers this as the essence of her courage and his own cowardice.

That night, he tries to explain his thoughts to his wife, who understands but raises objections. She suggests that the daughter may be exaggerating her transformation to make it more dramatic and self-aggrandizing. She also points out that the daughter is not known for being compassionate, while the protagonist has always been generous and compassionate, which also requires courage. She also reminds him that he left the language school due to his mother's illness, which should be taken into consideration.

The protagonist thanks his wife for her understanding but offers counterarguments. He believes that even if the daughter is misrepresenting herself, it is still evidence of her courage to act despite objections. He also believes that selfishness can be a form of courage, and many people have dying parents but still pursue their goals. As they lie in bed, the protagonist thinks about the daughter and wonders what she will do on the ranch and if she is scared or has reservations. He wonders what resources she believes she possesses to move so far from her family and if she loves herself the most in this new environment.","The protagonist, a man who considers himself cowardly, reflects on a lunch he had with his wife's sister and her new husband. The husband's daughter, a young woman who recently walked the Appalachian Trail and is now moving to Wyoming to work on a cattle ranch, also joins the lunch. The protagonist is fascinated by the daughter's courage and her ability to not care about other people's opinions. This leads him to contemplate his own lack of courage and his tendency to worry about what others think of him.

Later that night, he shares his thoughts with his wife, who offers counterarguments. She suggests that the daughter might be exaggerating her transformation and that the protagonist's generosity and compassion are also forms of courage. She also reminds him of the context of his own anxieties when he left a language school. Although he appreciates his wife's perspective, he provides his own counterarguments.

He believes that even if the daughter is exaggerating, her ability to take action despite objections is a sign of courage. He also considers selfishness as a form of courage, and he thinks that many people have personal struggles but still pursue their goals. As they lay in bed, he contemplates what the daughter's life on the ranch will be like and wonders about her fears, reservations, and sources of comfort in this new environment.

The story explores the protagonist's insecurities and his admiration for the daughter's ability to live life on her terms, free from the expectations and opinions of others. It raises questions about courage, self-love, and the choices people make to pursue their desires.",s12
Have You Ever Met One?,Rivka Galchen,"I answered that I’d been visited by three ghosts.

Was it three?

The first ghost showed up in the form of a Bernese mountain dog. It was like this. I was staying at a cabin with my husband’s family over the Christmas break. This large dog, maybe two hundred and fifty pounds, came to the back door. He didn’t bark—he looked in through the glass pane and waited patiently. My father-in-law, who, as a child, had shared a home with a deer and a flying squirrel, opened the door.

That giant mountain dog came up the steps, crossed the room, and greeted me with a gentle head push. He put his nose down between his front paws, to make himself lower than me. He wagged his tail, gently. He had chosen me. He visited every day that week, for an hour or two in the morning, an hour or two in the afternoon, following me all around the house and out into the yard, too. I get along with dogs fine, generally, but this was something else. We loved each other. His nametag read “Kush.” To the rest of the family, he was merely polite. I don’t know how to explain it, but my father’s spirit was in that dog. Yes, my father had also been giant, and gentle, but it was more than that. My father was paying me a visit. It was strange, but also obvious. This was some fifteen years ago. In the year or so after the encounter, it seemed like I was meeting Bernese mountain dogs in elevators and on sidewalks all the time, but, when I met Kush, who was also my father, he was the first Bernese mountain dog I’d ever seen.

Where were all those dogs now? The breed had surged in popularity, then, it seemed, vanished.

I met the next ghost at a book-club meeting at the Boulder Public Library. I didn’t live in Boulder, I was passing through, but there was a notice in the newspaper about the book club, and my husband and I thought it sounded fun. I was a better person when I was young, and more open. The book club was reading “The Overcoat,” by Nikolai Gogol. Poor Akaky Akakievich spends all his savings on a new overcoat; the coat is stolen; after a series of further humiliations, trying to reclaim the coat, he dies of a fever; there are reports of his ghost haunting St. Petersburg, stealing coats from others.

It was a mixed crowd at the book club. Was the story about bureaucracy? About human vanity? About folklore? Was it a satire, or a tragedy, etc. It was the usual discussion. But then a small, thin man sitting in the corner scolded us all for missing the point. “Ghosts are real,” he said. The story was about a real ghost and “none of you understand that.” The thin man said that he knew that ghosts were real because for years he had worked at a slaughterhouse in Broomfield.

The man’s comments were received politely, but he left the meeting frustrated. Upon reflection, it was clear, to me and my husband, that the man from Broomfield was himself a ghost. That was what he was trying to say.

The last ghost was a mom I knew only a little bit, from my youth. Her husband was a professional trumpeter. I babysat for her two boys a few times. The last time I did so, they were so out of control when their parents came home that I was never asked back again—which I thought was reasonable. Later, two very sad things happened in that family: one of the boys died in a car accident, and the mom had a seizure in the night and was found to have a brain tumor. By that time, I lived in a city thousands of miles away and hadn’t seen the family in years. But one night, more than a year after I learned of the tumor, I had a very vivid dream with Leona in it—Leona was the mom’s name—and we said hello and were very happy to see each other. Really happy. The next day my own mom called me to tell me that Leona had died. I’d never had a dream with Leona in it before, and I never had another one after.

I told my daughter about the ghosts, because I wanted to be honest with her. Ghosts aren’t real, but also they are? Or something like that. I don’t know what I wanted to communicate to her. Probably I was showing off. I said three ghosts. But wasn’t that misleading? I had spent so many years interested in ghosts, the dead, ancestors I’d never met, anything sad and gone—that world felt real to me. But I haven’t seen a single ghost in more than ten years. Wait, no, I fixed the math. I hadn’t seen one in . . . the number of years was the age of my daughter. Now I spend my time more fully among the living. Either that, or the ghost these days is me.","The narrator recounts three encounters with ghostly figures. The first ghost appears in the form of a Bernese mountain dog named Kush. The narrator stays at a cabin with her husband's family, and this dog visits her daily, exhibiting behavior similar to her deceased father. The second encounter happens at a book club meeting where the group discusses Nikolai Gogol's ""The Overcoat."" A thin man argues that ghosts are real, implying that he himself is a ghost. Lastly, the narrator dreams of a woman named Leona, whom she babysat for years ago. The next day, the narrator's mother informs her that Leona had passed away. The narrator ponders the existence of ghosts and their connection to the living, ultimately realizing that she hasn't encountered any ghosts in over ten years. She wonders if she now occupies the role of the ghost herself.","The narrator recounts a series of encounters with what they believe to be three ghosts. The first ghost appeared in the form of a Bernese mountain dog named Kush that visited them during a vacation. The dog's behavior and resemblance to the narrator's father made them believe that it was their father's spirit paying them a visit. The second ghost encounter occurred at a book club meeting where a thin man passionately proclaimed that ghosts are real. The narrator and their husband suspect that the man himself was a ghost based on his demeanor and comments. The final ghost encounter happened in a dream where the narrator saw Leona, a mother they had known from their youth. The next day, they learned that Leona had passed away. The narrator reflects on their fascination with ghosts and the afterlife and wonders if they themselves are becoming the ghost as they focus more on the present rather than the deceased. They share their experiences with their daughter, unsure of the message they want to convey but feeling the need to be honest.",s13
Good Boys,Honor Levy,"We’re on the rooftop with the boys. The boys are calling girls dogs, like, “She’s a dog, a total dog.” They don’t mean bitches. They just mean dogs. If they wanted to tell us that a girl was a bitch they would say, “She’s a bitch, a total bitch.” When the boys say something, they mean it. That’s why we like them. We’re not dogs. That’s why they like us. That’s why we’re on the rooftop.

The house has three floors. The ceilings are high. I know that if one of the boys fell off the rooftop he’d die. I know that none of the boys will fall off—not tonight, at least. Tonight, they’re not roughhousing or drinking tequila or annoying me. They’ve left the tennis rackets on the second floor, and they want to tell us about their trip to Greece. In Greece, the cigarettes are cheap. They filled an entire suitcase with little yellow boxes of George Karelias and Sons. They say we can smoke as many as we want. They’re proud. The cigarettes are so cheap. The boys are so proud. We laugh. Zoe laughs like Tinkerbell, the air whistling between the gaps in her teeth. She’s definitely not a dog.

I know we’re high up. I know our lives would be ruined if one of the boys fell, but tall plants are growing on the edge of the rooftop and I can’t see the cobblestones. If I could see that little cobblestoned street and the boys’ little Smart car, it would be easier to imagine them falling. It would be easier to remember that I’m in Paris. It would be easier to laugh like Zoe, like Tinkerbell, like a real girl, a girl who is not a dog.

I can’t see the Panthéon or the observatory or the park. I can see only the boys and their tanned stomachs and the scrapes they got from falling off the moped. We could be anywhere. We could be back in New York or near my house in L.A. or at some Airbnb in Berlin. I’d like to go to Berlin, to dance with the boys at Berghain, to eat knafeh with Zoe, to see the Reichstag or whatever, but the boys don’t want to go. Athens is the new Berlin. In Athens, the cigarettes are cheap. I thought Kraków was the new Berlin. The boys laugh and shake their heads. I can smell their wet-puppy-dog hair.

The sun is setting and the sky is so pink. Pink like the canopy bed I never got, like Kirby, like peonies, like the cheeks of a girl who the boys have just called a dog. I stand at the edge of the rooftop holding my phone just above the plants, trying to take a photo, trying not to drop it. The boys tell me that if I want something to post on Instagram they’ll text me a Greek sunset. I’m not going to post anything. It’s just for my grandma. They want me to show her a Greek sunset. All their grandmas are dead. In Greece, the sky gets even pinker, like, way pinker. The Greeks have four words for sunset. One for each of the boys. Tomorrow, they leave to work on their barbed-wire sculptures at some studio space in Normandy. Tonight, we’re in Paris, but all they want to talk about is Greece. They wish they could have stayed, stayed away from Paris, from Normandy, from Bennington and Bard, from the rooftop, from all this. Their moms have ovarian cancer. Their girlfriends are pregnant again. They’re sure to fail a class next semester. In Greece, none of that matters. In Greece, they sail on boats and make sketches of naked marble women and all sleep in one king-size bed. In Greece, they touch sculptures of gods. In Greece, they put their art-history education to good use. In Greece, they were happy. We want them to be happy. We let them tell us about the olives and the stray cats and the monks and the night they crashed the moped and the windmills and the dead dolphin and the economy. I want to ask them how many dogs they saw, but then again I don’t really care.

Dogs are girls who care. Girls who ask too many questions are dogs. Dogs comment on how high the ceilings are. Dogs want to know who this rooftop really belongs to. Dogs ask what your dads do for work. Dogs post sunsets on Instagram. Dogs throw up when they drink tequila. Dogs beg for games of rooftop tennis. Dogs ask where the Eiffel Tower is. Dogs wear too much perfume. Dogs stink. Dogs get mad when the boys kiss me or Zoe. Dogs don’t know how to keep it casual. Dogs whine. Dogs don’t want the boys to be happy. Dogs want to be held after sex, to be petted, to be taken care of. Dogs make a big deal when you get them pregnant. Dogs don’t know how to just take care of it while you’re with your boys in Greece. Dogs are too loud. Dogs get excited too fast. Dogs need you. Dogs just don’t get it. Dogs don’t get to hang out on the roof. It’s too high, they’re too wild, they might fall and then we’d have to catch them or something.","The story takes place on a rooftop where a group of boys and girls are hanging out. The boys refer to girls as dogs, but clarify that they mean it in a non-offensive way. The boys are well-liked because they are sincere in their words and actions. The girls appreciate that they are not treated like dogs, which is why they enjoy spending time with the boys on the rooftop.

The house they are on has three floors with high ceilings. The girls are aware that falling off the rooftop would be fatal. However, they are not concerned about this tonight because the boys are not being reckless. They have left their tennis rackets on the second floor and instead want to share stories about their trip to Greece. The boys are proud of the cheap cigarettes they brought back from Greece and offer the girls as many as they want. The girls find this amusing and laugh, particularly Zoe, whose laughter resembles that of Tinkerbell. The girls feel a sense of belonging with the boys, unlike being treated as dogs.

Despite being on a rooftop, the girls cannot see the surroundings clearly due to the tall plants growing on the edge. They cannot see the cobblestoned street or the boys' car, which makes it difficult for them to fully grasp the reality of their location in Paris. The only visible things are the boys themselves, their tanned stomachs, and the scrapes from a moped accident. The girls feel disconnected from their surroundings and think they could be anywhere.

The girls mention their desire to go to Berlin and experience different things, but the boys dismiss the idea, stating that Athens is the new Berlin. They laugh and shake their heads, and the girls can smell the boys' hair, which reminds them of wet puppies. The sunset is pink, resembling various things that the girls associate with femininity. One of the girls tries to capture the moment with her phone but is cautious not to drop it. The boys offer to send her a photo of a Greek sunset if she wants something to post on Instagram, but she declines, explaining that it's only for her grandma. The boys mention that all their grandmas have passed away. They describe Greek sunsets as even more vibrant and mention that the Greeks have four words for sunset, each representing one of the boys.

The boys express their discontent with their current lives, mentioning their mothers' ovarian cancer, their girlfriends' pregnancies, and the likelihood of failing a class. They reminisce about their time in Greece, where they were happy and carefree. The girls listen attentively, wanting the boys to be happy. They talk about olives, stray cats, monks, a moped accident, windmills, a dead dolphin, and the economy. The girls think about asking the boys how many dogs they saw in Greece but realize they don't actually care.

The girls reflect on what it means to be called a dog by the boys. They associate being a dog with caring too much, asking too many questions, and being needy. Dogs are seen as demanding attention and not being able to keep things casual. The girls believe dogs don't understand how to be independent and enjoy their own lives. They are loud, easily excited, and require constant reassurance. The girls don't want to be seen as dogs and strive to be more like the boys, who are carefree and independent.

The story ends with the girls acknowledging that dogs are not allowed on the rooftop because they are too wild and might fall. The girls don't want to catch or take care of the dogs, as they believe dogs should be able to take care of themselves.","The story is set on a rooftop where the narrator and their friends, referred to as ""the boys,"" are hanging out. The boys use the term ""dogs"" to describe girls, not meaning it in a derogatory way, but rather as a term to differentiate girls from themselves. The boys are seen as genuine and truthful, which is why the narrator and their friends like them. The rooftop overlooks a cobblestoned street, but the narrator can't see it due to the tall plants growing on the edge.

The boys start talking about their trip to Greece, where they bought cheap cigarettes and are proud of it. The narrator and their friend Zoe find the boys amusing, and there is a sense of camaraderie among them. The rooftop's height is mentioned, and the potential danger of falling is acknowledged, but it doesn't deter the enjoyment of the moment.

The narrator reflects on the fact that they can't see the famous landmarks of Paris from the rooftop, only the boys and their tanned stomachs. There is a mention of the boys falling off a moped and getting scrapes, which indicates their adventurous nature. The boys consider Athens to be the new Berlin and talk about their desire to stay in Greece, away from their personal problems and responsibilities elsewhere. They mention their mothers having ovarian cancer, their girlfriends being pregnant, and the possibility of failing a class. In Greece, they feel free and happy, sailing on boats, sketching sculptures, and immersing themselves in art history.

The boys share stories about their experiences in Greece, such as encountering olives, stray cats, monks, crashing a moped, seeing windmills and a dead dolphin, and discussing the state of the economy. The narrator and Zoe listen attentively, wanting the boys to be happy. They let the boys talk, even though they don't necessarily care about every detail.

The narrator then reflects on what they perceive to be the qualities of ""dogs,"" referring to girls who care too much, ask too many questions, comment on trivial matters, post on social media, and get emotional or clingy. Dogs are seen as lacking the ability to keep things casual, being needy, and not understanding the boys' desire for independence. The narrator and their friends don't want to be associated with this behavior.

The story ends with the narrator implying that dogs, being too unpredictable, are not allowed on the rooftop due to the potential danger they pose.",s14
The Kingdom That Failed,Haruki Murakami,"Just behind the kingdom that failed ran a nice little river. It was a clear, lovely stream, and many fish lived in it. Weeds grew there, too, and the fish ate the weeds. The fish didn’t care whether or not the kingdom had failed, of course. Whether it was a kingdom or a republic made no difference to them. They didn’t vote or pay taxes. Makes no difference to us, they figured.

I washed my feet in the stream. A short soak in the icy-cold water turned them red. From the stream, you could see the walls and the tower of the castle in the kingdom that failed. The two-colored flag still flew from the tower, fluttering in the breeze. Everyone passing along the riverbanks would see the flag and say, “Hey, look at that. It’s the flag of the kingdom that failed.”

Q and I are friends—or should I say, were friends in college. It’s been more than ten years since the two of us did anything that friends do. Which is why I use the past tense. Anyhow, we were friends.

Whenever I try to tell anyone about Q—to describe him as a person—I feel totally helpless. I’ve never been very good at explaining anything, but, even taking that into account, it’s a special challenge to try to explain Q to someone. And when I do try I’m overcome by a deep, deep sense of despair.

Let me make this as simple as I can.

Q and I are the same age, but he’s about five hundred and seventy times more handsome. He has a nice personality, too. He’s never pushy or boastful, and he never gets angry if someone accidentally causes a problem for him. “Oh, well,” he’ll say. “I’ve done the same thing myself.” But, in fact, I’ve never heard of him doing anything bad to anyone.

He was well brought up, too. His father was a doctor who had his own clinic on the island of Shikoku, which meant that Q never wanted for pocket money. Not that he was extravagant with it. He was a smart dresser and also an impressive athlete, who’d played interscholastic tennis in high school. He enjoyed swimming and went to the pool at least twice a week. Politically, he was a moderate liberal. His grades, if not outstanding, were at least good. He almost never studied for exams, but he never failed a course. He really listened to the lectures.

He was surprisingly talented on the piano, and he owned a lot of Bill Evans and Mozart records. His favorite writers tended to be French—Balzac and Maupassant. Sometimes he’d read a novel by Kenzaburo Oe or another writer. His critiques were always right on the mark.

He was popular with women, naturally enough. But he was not one of those “anyone he can get his hands on” type of guys. He had a steady girlfriend, a pretty sophomore from one of the fancy women’s colleges. They went out every Sunday.

Anyhow, that was the Q I knew in college. In short, he was a character without flaws.

Back then, Q lived in the apartment next door to mine. What with lending salt or borrowing salad dressing, we got to be friends, and soon we were at each other’s places all the time, listening to records, drinking beer. Once, my girlfriend and I drove out to the Kamakura shore with Q and his girlfriend. We were very comfortable together. Then, during the summer break of my senior year, I moved out, and that was that.

The next time I saw Q, almost a decade had gone by. I was reading a book by a swanky hotel pool near the Akasaka district. Q was sitting in the deck chair next to mine, and beside him was a beautiful long-legged woman in a bikini.

I knew right away that it was Q. He was as handsome as ever, and now, just over thirty, he evinced a certain dignity that he hadn’t had before. Young women walking by gave him a quick once-over.

He didn’t notice me sitting next to him. I’m a fairly ordinary-looking guy, and I was wearing sunglasses. I wasn’t sure whether I should talk to him, but in the end I decided not to. He and the woman were deep in conversation, and I hesitated to interrupt them. Besides, there wasn’t a lot that he and I could have talked about. “I lent you salt, remember?” “Hey, that’s right, and I borrowed a bottle of salad dressing.” We would have run out of topics quickly. So I kept my mouth shut and stuck to my book.

Still, I couldn’t help overhearing what Q and his pretty companion were saying to each other. It was a fairly complicated matter. I gave up trying to read and listened to them.

“No way,” the woman said. “You’ve got to be kidding.”

“I know, I know,” Q said. “I know exactly what you’re saying. But you’ve got to see it my way, too. I’m not doing this because I want to. It was the guys upstairs. I’m just telling you what they decided. So don’t look at me that way.”

“Yeah, right,” she said.

Q let out a sigh.

Let me summarize their long conversation—filling in a good deal by way of imagination, of course. Q seemed to be now a director at a TV station or some such place, and the woman was a moderately well-known singer or actress. She was being let go from a project because of some sort of trouble or scandal she had become involved in, or maybe just because her popularity had declined. The job of informing her had been left to Q, who was the person most directly responsible for day-to-day operations. I don’t know much about the entertainment industry, so I can’t be sure of the finer points, but I don’t think I’m too far off over all.

Judging from what I heard, Q was discharging his duty with genuine sincerity.

“We can’t survive without sponsors,” he said. “I don’t have to tell you that—you know the business.”

“So you’re telling me that you don’t have any responsibility or say in the matter?”

“No, I’m not telling you that. But what I can do is really limited.”

Their conversation took another turn into a dead-end street. She wanted to know just how much he had exerted himself on her behalf. He insisted that he had done everything he could, but he had no way to prove it, and she didn’t believe him. I didn’t really believe him, either. The more sincerely he tried to explain things, the more a fog of insincerity came to hang over everything. But it wasn’t Q’s fault. It wasn’t anybody’s fault. Which was why there was no way out of this conversation.

It appeared that the woman had always liked Q. I sensed that they had got along well until this business came up. Which probably only added to the woman’s anger. In the end, though, she was the one who gave in.

“O.K.,” she said. “I’ve had it. Buy me a Coke, will you?”

When he heard that, Q breathed a sigh of relief and went off to the drink stand. The woman put on her sunglasses and stared straight ahead. By this time, I had read the same line in my book a couple hundred times.

Soon, Q came back with two big paper cups. Handing one to the woman, he lowered himself into his deck chair. “Don’t get too depressed about this,” he said. “Any day now you’ll—”

But, before he could finish, the woman threw her full cup at him. It caught him square in the face, and about a third of the Coca-Cola splashed onto me. Without a word, the woman stood up and, giving a little yank at the seat of her bikini, strode off without a backward glance. Q and I just sat there stunned for a good fifteen seconds. The people nearby were staring at us in shock.

Q was the first to regain his composure. “Sorry,” he said and held a towel out to me.

“That’s O.K.,” I answered. “I’ll just take a shower.”

Looking slightly annoyed, he drew the towel back and used it to dry himself.

“At least let me pay for the book,” he said. It was true that my book was soaked. But it was just a cheap paperback, and not a very interesting one at that. Anyone who threw a Coke on it and prevented me from reading it was doing me a favor. He brightened up when I said that. He had the same great smile as always.

Q left at that point, apologizing to me once more as he stood to go. He had never realized who I was.

I decided to give this story the title “The Kingdom That Failed” because I happened to read an article in the evening paper that day about an African kingdom that had failed. “To see a splendid kingdom fade away,” it said, “is far sadder than seeing a second-rate republic collapse.”","The story begins by describing a failed kingdom and a beautiful river that runs behind it. The narrator, who used to be friends with a person named Q in college, reflects on their friendship and how they haven't been close for over ten years. The narrator struggles to describe Q's personality but highlights his exceptional looks and good nature. Q comes from a well-to-do family, is popular with women, and has various talents and interests. The narrator and Q used to live in neighboring apartments and spent a lot of time together, but they drifted apart after college.

Years later, the narrator unexpectedly sees Q at a hotel pool, accompanied by a beautiful woman. He overhears their conversation and learns that Q is now a director at a TV station and the woman is a singer or actress. Q is tasked with informing her that she is being let go from a project due to some scandal or decline in popularity. Q sincerely tries to explain the situation, but the woman is angry and doesn't believe him. Eventually, she throws a cup of Coca-Cola at Q's face and walks away.

The narrator and Q are both stunned by the incident. Q apologizes to the narrator, not realizing who he is, and leaves. The narrator reflects on the failed kingdom mentioned in an article he read and decides to title his story ""The Kingdom That Failed.""","The story begins by describing a failed kingdom and a river that flows behind it. The fish in the river seem unaffected by the kingdom's demise. The narrator recalls his friendship with a man named Q during their college days. Q was handsome, kind, and successful in various aspects of life. Q's father was a doctor, he had a steady girlfriend, and he was well-liked by everyone. They were close friends in college, but the narrator hadn't seen Q in almost a decade.

It becomes clear that Q is now a director at a TV station and the woman is a singer or actress facing some sort of scandal or decline in popularity. Q is responsible for informing her that she is being let go from a project. The conversation becomes tense as the woman questions Q's sincerity and involvement in the matter. Despite Q's efforts to explain the limitations of his role, the woman's anger escalates. Eventually, she throws a cup of Coca-Cola at Q's face before storming off without looking back.

The narrator and Q are left stunned by the incident. Q apologizes to the narrator and offers to pay for his wet book. The narrator doesn't mind and sees it as a favor since the book wasn't very interesting. Q leaves without realizing the narrator's identity.

The story concludes with the narrator reflecting on the title, ""The Kingdom That Failed,"" after reading an article about an African kingdom's downfall. The narrator finds the fading of a once-magnificent kingdom sadder than the collapse of a lesser republic.",s15
The Mirror,David Hoon Kim,"She was the star pupil, extroverted, the teacher’s favorite; I was in my third year, unsure of myself, my life, and everything in between. I met her in an Ibsen module at Copenhagen University. She always sat in the front row and spent the hour diligently taking notes, or giving answers before anyone else could during the tutorial sessions. I, too, knew the answers but I didn’t say them out loud; instead, I waited for someone else to speak. More often than not, she was that person. When she spoke, her “e,” “a,” and “æ” vowels were a little too crisp, a little too clean-sounding, like the rigsdansk of some bygone TV presenter.

We were the only Asians, two dark spots among the bright blond heads of varying shades, and I wondered if she had also been adopted by Danish parents, as was the case with many Asians in Denmark, brought up to think of themselves as Danish. The only thing Asian about us was our birth, and, of course, our appearance. Over the years, I had met a number of others like me: the first when I was fourteen, during a class trip to Paris; the second in my first year of university; another was presented to me at a Friday bar by a mutual friend; and a fourth, an adoptee from Norway, had been a kollegium floor-mate. Mette Honoré, Helle Nielsen, Mia Kjærsgaard, Unn Fahlstrøm. With each, things had never gone beyond the initial conversation, an exchange of backgrounds. I hadn’t given any of them much thought since our respective encounters, but I didn’t forget their names, which all belonged to Korean-born Scandinavian girls.

At first glance, Ditte seemed to fit the same mold. On the last day of class, I found her waiting for me in the corridor outside the auditorium. Up to then, she had behaved as if I wasn’t there, though she must have noticed me the same way I had noticed her. In the tone of someone who has rehearsed her words beforehand, she asked me if I wanted to get a beer at the cafeteria. As we walked in silence, I thought I knew what was coming. After all, I had been through this before with other adoptees. Like them, she was surprised when I told her that I had been born in Japan, not Korea. I wasn’t her first adoptee, but the ones she had met thus far had been girls. I was, in a manner of speaking, her first boy. I learned that we had arrived in Denmark at the ages of five months and six months, respectively. We were both a year younger than our fellow-students, who had, in the Danish tradition, taken a sabbatical year to work or travel.

Was she really all that different from the other Korean girls I had met? That was what I found myself thinking, during our third outing, as I glanced at her shadowy profile next to me in the darkness of a cinema at Scala. Now I wonder if it wasn’t so much Ditte herself as how alike I thought we were that drew me to her. (Or perhaps that is the essence of attraction: a longing to see something of oneself in another.) Like looking into an enchanted mirror: when I looked at her, I saw a Dane who looked like me. I remember, one night, we lay face to face and gazed wordlessly into each other’s eyes until Ditte broke the spell by bursting into laughter. In bed, she was very clear about what she wanted, what she didn’t want, how she felt, and how she wanted to feel, demonstrating the same thoroughness she had shown in the classroom. Her scent, the consistency of her hair, the color of her nipples—everything about her was at once strange and familiar. When she told me that she had never used deodorant because she didn’t have to, I knew exactly what she was talking about. I had never bought a stick of deodorant in my life, though I had carried one around and even pretended to use it all through my upper-secondary years, so that I wouldn’t stand out among the other kids at my boarding school. A look of recognition seemed to dawn in her gaze when I told her about my constant need to prove myself when meeting new people. In retrospect, I’m not sure what these shared moments of understanding and complicity meant to her. Did they mean anything at all?

We were together for almost four months, during which time we explored Copenhagen as if for the first time, with new eyes. I had never noticed all the busts, bas-reliefs and other three-dimensional representations scattered throughout the city, which we baptized “the city of statues” because the statues outnumbered the inhabitants, joked Ditte. She had grown up in Esbjerg, in West Jutland, and spent part of every summer on Fanø, where her parents had a summer home overlooking the Wadden Sea. I had grown up in the Whiskey Belt, just north of Copenhagen, my summers punctuated by fishing trips with my father to the Faroe Islands. She loved salted black licorice, the typical Scandinavian kind. Before bed, I used to steal mine from the cabinet where my mother kept it in a glass jar shaped like a Swedish Dalecarlian horse. We both loved having øllebrød for breakfast; observing the sky on bright summer nights when dusk seems to go on forever; watching old Danish television dramas like “Jeg kan ikke vente til mandag!” and “Olive og Tom.”

Perhaps a part of me already knew it couldn’t last, the theory of compatibility that I had constructed like scaffolding around us, and whose fragile symmetry I marvelled at in secret. We were too alike, I remember thinking; it wasn’t normal to be this close to someone in so short a time, like skipping to the end of a book one has been reading too fast from the start. But the mirror at last reflected someone back at me. Around that time, I had a strange dream. In it, Ditte was my sister, the two of us separated at birth, and, although I knew such a thing to be impossible—my blood was Japanese, hers was Korean, after all—I woke in the dark with an erection, my heart beating like a tam-tam. I was alone in my bed; Ditte had gone back to her hall of residence at some point during the night without waking me. When we saw each other again, I made the mistake of telling her about my dream. Though I had left out the part about my erection, bewilderment and disgust clouded her face, as if I had laid bare some unspeakable fantasy. She asked me if that was how I had always seen her. The thought of an incestuous relationship with a long-lost sister had never crossed my mind, I said, but Ditte refused to believe me.

Things were never the same after that. One day, she informed me of her intention to spend the weekend in Esbjerg, where her parents still lived. We had often talked about going together, but the trip had never materialized. The following night, I received a phone call; in the background I heard voices, music, as though she had called me from a party. She seemed distracted or irritated by something. We ended the conversation without saying goodbye. I eventually learned that she had left me for her thesis supervisor, who also happened to be my thesis supervisor. After that, I couldn’t walk past certain places—the statue of Adam Oehlenschläger near the zoo in Norske Allé, the skating rink in Nørrebro Park, even the oil tanks at Prøvestenen—without being reminded of her. The worst was going to see my thesis supervisor. I couldn’t be sure, but it seemed that the man had no idea about me and Ditte. He was out of shape, dark-haired (for a blond Dane), and his chin receded a bit. Other than his vast and bottomless intelligence, his daggerlike wit, his impressive list of publications, what could she possibly see in him? And that was when I realized that I had never really known her, any more than I had known the adopted Korean girls before her. She had become a name to add to the others. All this time, I had thought of her as a mirror, a strange and beguiling reflection, but it would seem that she had been drawn to me because I was different, a change from all the Danes she had previously dated.","The narrator, a third-year student at Copenhagen University, meets a fellow student named Ditte in an Ibsen module. Ditte is the star pupil and the teacher's favorite, while the narrator is unsure of themselves. They both realize they are the only Asians in the class and wonder if Ditte is also adopted by Danish parents like many Asians in Denmark. They start spending time together and discover that they were both adopted from Asia, though Ditte is Korean and the narrator is Japanese.

The narrator is drawn to Ditte because she looks like a Dane who resembles them. They share intimate moments and connections, understanding each other's experiences as adoptees. They explore Copenhagen together and discover shared interests and cultural references. However, the narrator feels a sense of unease, thinking that their intense connection might not be normal or sustainable.

The narrator has a dream where Ditte is their sister, and it arouses them. When they tell Ditte about the dream, she reacts with disgust and accuses the narrator of seeing her in an incestuous way. Their relationship becomes strained, and Ditte decides to spend the weekend in her hometown of Esbjerg. Soon after, the narrator learns that Ditte has left them for their thesis supervisor, who is also Ditte's thesis supervisor.

The narrator is heartbroken and finds it difficult to move on. They are reminded of Ditte whenever they pass certain places in the city. They also feel resentment towards their thesis supervisor, questioning what Ditte sees in him. The narrator realizes that they never truly knew Ditte or the other Korean girls they had encountered before. They had seen Ditte as a mirror, but she was drawn to them because they were different from the Danes she had previously dated.

In the end, the narrator reflects on their experience with Ditte and the realization that their connection was not as deep or meaningful as they had initially thought. They come to terms with the fact that Ditte was just another name added to the list of encounters with adopted Korean girls.","The protagonist, an Asian student in Copenhagen University, meets Ditte, another Asian student, in an Ibsen module. They bond over their shared experience as adoptees in Denmark. The protagonist is attracted to Ditte because she looks like him and they share similar experiences. They enter a romantic relationship and spend four months exploring Copenhagen together. However, their relationship begins to unravel when the protagonist has a strange dream about Ditte being his sister. When he tells her about the dream, she is disgusted and ends their relationship. He later learns that Ditte left him for their thesis supervisor, who is also the protagonist's thesis supervisor. The protagonist realizes that he never truly knew Ditte, and that she was attracted to him because he was different from the Danes she had previously dated.",s16
Listening for the Click,Johanna Ekström,"In Carl’s apartment, on Linnaeusgatan, near the university, black mold is growing behind the fridge. It’s the first time I’ve heard the term. Black mold is worse than other mold, it seems. I know about green mold, but I’ve always just called it mold. For asthmatics, like Carl, black mold can be plain dangerous. Carl decontaminates the fridge. He holds his breath and sprays. I’m on the toilet, door open. That’s how well we know each other.

Carl shares the apartment with a friend. Martin is hard to read. Smart, a slacker with tunnel vision. He wears a thick ring, inlaid with a ruby. The ruby looks like a blood blister. He doesn’t talk to me. Sometimes he grunts. I’m not sure if the sounds he makes have their own meaning, or if they are uttered out of pure necessity. Martin eats baby food out of glass jars. I hear the click when he opens a jar, a guarantee that its vacuum seal is intact. The baby food is the opposite of the black mold. Martin eats the baby food in bed and watches porn while wrapped in a blanket with a Betty Boop print. This is what he is: grunt, click, baby food, click, porn, click. With a future as a banker and a high-income individual, click. I can’t imagine him being able to get hard, jerk off, come. It’s as if growing or shrinking didn’t exist for him.

When Martin drags himself to lectures, I borrow his porn mags, which he keeps in a rattan magazine stand that may once have held yarn or knitting patterns. A small boatneck sailor shirt for a grandchild. A beanie with a pompom on it. I think Martin harbors a lot of tenderness.

One centerfold shows a woman on all fours, with a machine gun hanging at a diagonal between her legs, against a backdrop of camouflage netting. She’s wearing a military cap and feminine boots. Her lower back arches under the weight of her own willingness, and the cartridge belt burns into her skin like the lick of a whip. Or does it offer relief, like a doctor’s cool fingertips searching for an inflamed tendon? Her buttocks are shiny. All of her is shiny, rubbed with oil. You can glide right into any of her orifices.

Carl has a water bed. He never changes the sheets. It doesn’t matter. He smells good. When I stay with Carl I sleep in Carl’s bed. Sometimes we fuck. It’s nice, and it feels like the beginning or the end of a love story. Always either the beginning or the end.

Carl has a friend called Lizzy. She braids her hair and makes side buns. She wears dresses with puffed sleeves and lacing at the waist. Is this a form of irony? When I comment on the cross-stitching with a polite enthusiasm, she points out that it references a type of folklore. The dress was sewn and embroidered by a Polish Jewish aunt on her mother’s side. She talks endlessly about her family. It turns out that she and Carl are related somehow. Lizzy is the chairperson of a comedic am-dram society. I can just picture her with a wine-red costume, a tall hat, drumsticks, maybe a drum, too. When she does let her hair down, it’s as if she were naked, horny, drunk, limitless. It’s as if she’d become the pornographic centerfold. Carl has sex with her without telling me. I find out from Martin. So Martin does, in fact, talk to me. Just that once. He punctuates his sentence with a “moop, moop.”

Lizzy is both clean and fuckable. Strict, consistent, selfish in an honest way. I’m more . . . It’s twofold. I try to figure out how I’m supposed to fit into this. I often think of the word “division.”

When I meet Johan, the situation changes. I fall in love with Johan, and Johan thinks he has fallen in love with me. And, when this happens, I suspect that Carl is in love with me, too. That’s why I lie to Carl about Johan. Johan and I meet in secret. I want to be like Johan. When I’m alone, all I am is him. Johan says this: “The smell between the teeth, the one that comes out when you floss, is disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.” And I know I’ll never forget the way he says “disgusting.” The word is divorced from everything that has to do with Johan’s sense of humor, that has to do with us. Disgusting. It’s a word that’s fixed to Johan’s world view. When Johan takes a trip, I borrow his clothes and practice his gestures. Thinking of myself and of existence as “disgusting” helps with my longing. The disgust doesn’t plug the hole, but it does decontaminate it.

I have clean, white teeth. Under Johan’s bed, I find two used condoms. I don’t let on about the condoms. They’re something else: dry petals, a thumb brace, masking tape. Picking them up and putting them in the trash is no skin off my back. I feel the same silent satisfaction that applies to all forms of cleaning.

Carl finds out that Johan and I are together. He says that he doesn’t want to see me. That I should make myself scarce. I remind him that he and I aren’t together and never have been. He says that it doesn’t matter what we are or have been. What’s interesting is that I’ve been lying. I remind him that he’s been lying, too. If he was in love with me and didn’t say anything, wasn’t that a form of lying? Carl says that what I need is a foundation course in philosophy. He says that I should ask for forgiveness, but, when I reply that first I’d need to know what I’m asking forgiveness for, he says that this is exactly the problem.

Our student union hosts a costume party. The theme is comic-book and cartoon characters. The girls are Minnie Mouse, Wonder Woman, Daisy Duck, Betty Boop. I’m the Hulk. I smear myself with green paint. Rub olive oil and dry shampoo into my hair. I tear up a pair of jeans and a plaid shirt. The only person who’d like me like this is Johan. But Johan is at a toga party across town.

Carl is dressed as the Practical Pig. Overalls, pig mask. I don’t know who the Practical Pig is. He looks like a member of the Ku Klux Klan. The American South. Mangrove swamps. Banjo on the porch. Root beer. Cornbread. Violence. The heart is a lonely hunter. Carl is the opposite of all that. Except when it comes to the heart. He has a hunting license. When he sees me he delivers a slap that knocks me off my feet. He asks how dare I be here. Another Practical Pig, identically dressed but fat and maskless, comes charging. He pushes Carl and grabs me by the shoulders, gets covered in green paint. I cry a little. Not because this hurts. But because everything hurts. He takes me to his dorm, opens a can of mussels, fries rice. Hands me shower gel, two in one. When I am nice and clean I am given food and a robe. He plays Miles Davis on the grand piano in the living room. It’s morning, and the smell of cardamom drifts over from the bakery opposite. The students in the building make coffee and go to their lectures. I almost doze off on the sofa, and Practical gives me a kiss on the forehead. I embrace him. He is moist and engorged.

Johan says that he isn’t in love with me. He likes me. He’s interested in me. But I don’t have it in me anymore. I can’t be wearing Johan’s clothes. They don’t fit me. I can barely move. Nothing is disgusting.

I give Carl severe shortness of breath. He misses his exam. Hisses into the hospital phone that I’m killing him. I’m crying. I like Carl. He didn’t beat me up. He gave me a slap. As you do in his circles. You hunt, shoot birds, decontaminate, dole out slaps. You don’t lie. You withhold love. I say I’m sorry. Sorry for being cowardly and unclear. For not knowing much about integrity and honor. But I don’t understand what’s being said. The mix of words and actions, tenderness, violence.

I read Janson’s “History of Art” for my art-history class. I think of Jansson’s temptation—the potato casserole served at Christmas. Traditions, patterns. Nationalism. I think of temptation itself. What it is. Of being able to give a correct description of the Venus of Willendorf. Of being on all fours with a machine gun. Of arching. Being wide open. And listening for the click.","The story is set in Carl's apartment, where the narrator and Carl live together. Carl suffers from asthma, and they discover black mold behind the fridge, which can be dangerous for asthmatics. Carl decontaminates the fridge while the narrator is on the toilet, highlighting their close relationship.

The narrator describes Martin, another roommate who is hard to read. Martin eats baby food and watches porn while wrapped in a blanket with a Betty Boop print. The narrator borrows Martin's porn magazines and finds a centerfold featuring a woman with a machine gun. The narrator also mentions Carl's water bed and their sexual relationship.

Lizzy, Carl's friend, is introduced as someone who braids her hair and wears dresses with puffed sleeves. She talks about her family and reveals that she is somehow related to Carl. Lizzy is also the chairperson of a comedic am-dram society. The narrator discovers that Carl has been having sex with Lizzy without their knowledge.

The situation changes when the narrator falls in love with Johan, and Johan thinks he has fallen in love with the narrator. The narrator suspects that Carl is also in love with them, so they lie to Carl about their relationship with Johan. The narrator tries to be like Johan and borrows his clothes and mimics his gestures. Johan's comment about the smell between teeth being disgusting sticks with the narrator.

The narrator finds two used condoms under Johan's bed but doesn't mention them. They clean them up and feel satisfied with the act of cleaning. When Carl finds out about the relationship between the narrator and Johan, he asks the narrator to make themselves scarce, leading to a confrontation about lying and forgiveness.

At a costume party, the narrator dresses up as the Hulk, and Carl is dressed as the Practical Pig. Carl slaps the narrator and another person dressed as the Practical Pig intervenes, taking the narrator to his dorm. They share a meal, and the person plays the piano, creating a comforting environment.

Johan tells the narrator that he is not in love with them, but only interested in them. The narrator realizes they can't be like Johan anymore and feels empty. The narrator's actions cause Carl severe shortness of breath, leading to a hospital visit. The narrator apologizes for their actions and lack of understanding.

The story ends with the narrator reflecting on temptation and the different experiences and emotions they have encountered throughout the narrative.","The story revolves around the unnamed narrator, Carl, Martin, Lizzy, and Johan, who all live in an apartment near the university. The narrator is in a complicated relationship with Carl, who suffers from asthma. Martin, their roommate, is mysterious and often communicates through grunts. He eats baby food, watches porn, and rarely speaks. Lizzy, another friend, is related to Carl and is involved in a comedic am-dram society. Johan enters the picture and the narrator falls in love with him. However, it is revealed that Carl is also in love with the narrator. The narrator lies to Carl about being with Johan, causing a rift between them. The relationship between the narrator and Johan becomes strained, and eventually, Johan admits that he is not in love with the narrator. Feeling lost and unable to fit in, the narrator causes Carl to have a severe asthma attack, leading Carl to be hospitalized.

Around the Corner You Can’t See Around,Lore Segal,"Ladies’ Lunch over and talk for the moment exhausted, we continued to sit around the table by the window that overlooked the Hudson River, to sip our wine, pour ourselves another glass. It was here that Bridget asked what everybody thought about this idea of “finding oneself.” “Is there a character in Homer, in Shakespeare, in the Bible who thinks to ask, ‘Who am I?’ ” And the conversation was off again.

“Besides Lear,” Farah said, “who asks ‘Who is it that can tell me who I am?’ And don’t you love the question ‘Who does he think he is’ or ‘Who do you think you are’ followed by a rhetorical exclamation point?”

Lucinella’s chair faced east. She had been watching people on the neighboring rooftop, and she said, “They’re having a party, and they didn’t invite me!”

“Do you know those people?” Ruth asked her.

“No,” Lucinella said.

Ilka said that her search began with her grandmother Ilonka, the one she was named for. “She died before I was born, but I’ve seen an old sepia photograph—two photographs, actually, taken by someone standing outside the open door to her bedroom. Great Aunt Mali used to let me play with—what did they call it?—the stereopticon, on Sunday afternoons when my mother’s cousins used to get together in Mali’s apartment just outside Vienna. I don’t think I remember my father being there. Tante Mali was immensely fat and old, with a sweet, lovely face. She and little Onkel Maxl ended up in Mauthausen. The magic of the stereopticon made the flower in a water glass on the bedside table, made the glass, three-dimensional and more real than the sepia grandmother sitting up in her crocheted bed jacket.”

Lotte frowned irritably when she said, “I will never understand why something made to look three-dimensional or virtual excites us more than the real thing in front of our noses. . . .”

“Mimesis,” Farah said. “Is it Aristotle or is it me who said that we like a likeness, in which, I guess, we search for ourselves?”

Ilka was following her own thought: “The room is lit from the left, so there must be a window in the corner that one can’t see around. Secrets of the sepia bedroom: someone picked that flower and put water into the water glass; someone had set the glass on the bedside table. . . .”

“That’s what I mean!” Lotte said. “What does it tell us about who we are that we are tenderly intrigued by an imaginary person walking through an old photograph but couldn’t care less about our neighbor passing our window at this very moment?”

“My mother found Ilonka’s old ice skates,” continued Ilka. “The grandmother in the bed jacket ice-skating blew my mind. I mean, when were skates even invented?”

Ruth consulted her smartphone. She said, “In 3000 B.C.”

“Look!” Lucinella said. “Look! The people on the roof! They’re bringing out the cake. It’s a birthday party.”

“Birthdays,” Bessie said. “People talk of the pathos of having missed their own, or their kid’s birthday, or graduation. Tell me one thing that ever signified at a birthday party, a graduation, at Thanksgiving, a Seder, a wedding even—”

“A funeral,” Farah said.

Ruth said, “Next Ladies’ Lunch will be at my place. The agenda: Tell some one thing that has thrown light on Who You Are.”

The next time the friends met, around Ruth’s table, Ilka read them what she had written about the morning she woke in her first English foster home, in 1938: “There, on a chest of drawers, was the suitcase my mother had packed for me. I lay in the strange bed and wondered what I was supposed to do. Presently I got up, I dressed slowly, and opened the door to the hallway. Where were all the people? The previous night there had been an old woman and her daughter who had fetched me from the station and brought me to this house where all the lights were on in all the rooms and a lot of smiling people stood around looking at me. A maidservant in a long white apron had taken me upstairs to the bathroom and run a bath. I understood that she meant me to get in, but I was ashamed and wouldn’t undress, and in the morning I could not remember having been brought up to this bedroom. I stepped out into the hallway and listened to the silence. A door stood ajar. I looked inside and saw a dressing table. A mirror, with photographs stuck into the frame, reflected a brush, a comb, and a pincushion in the shape of a heart. I gave the door what I told myself might have been an accidental push. It revealed the corner of somebody’s bed covered with a shiny green counterpane. I knew that I must not walk into other people’s bedrooms—should not be looking in. Was I allowed—was I meant—to use these stairs? I crept down to the next floor where there were a number of doors, but all of them were shut.”

“Bedrooms,” Bessie said. “It was Robbe-Grillet, if you please, who showed us that we were part of the room’s geography before we were able to give an account of the color of the wall or form a relationship with this or that piece of furniture. Try it! Imagine yourself into bed in your first bedroom; notice that you know the direction your feet are pointing, and you remember the location of the door in relation to the window.”

“And you define yourself as the who who inhabited that first bedroom?” Ruth asked her.

“Why do I have to define myself?” Bessie asked.

Ilka said, “Well, I am the refugee who tells the old story.”

“And I,” Lucinella said, “am the uninvited.”

“No, you’re not,” Lotte said. “You are here at the Ladies’ Lunch. But why am I the person at the party who argues with everything anybody says?”

“And I,” Farah said, “am the one who brings up the things nobody is interested in thinking about.”

“And you,” Ruth said to Bridget, “it’s you who got us asking ourselves who we are. What do you say?”

“That there isn’t any Who,” Bridget said. “I think it’s a silly question.”","During a ladies' lunch, the conversation turns to the idea of ""finding oneself."" The women discuss characters in literature who ask the question ""Who am I?"" and the fascination with self-discovery. Ilka shares her own search for identity, starting with her grandmother Ilonka. She recalls an old sepia photograph that sparked her curiosity about her family history. Lotte questions why people are more interested in virtual or imaginary experiences than the real world. The discussion touches on the significance of birthdays and other milestones. Ruth suggests that the next lunch will focus on sharing experiences that have shed light on each person's identity.

A Triangle,Giada Scodellaro,"I saw the couple out of the corner of my eye. I noticed them as I stepped out of a medical building. I noticed them because everything else in my peripheral vision shifted but they did not. The wind was blowing the leaves, the leaves were dying and leaping, and the couple was so still. The couple was unmoving. I was, too, looking at them. So it was the three of us as everything else moved, constant and full and wide. People brushed by our shoulders, sweeping our sides as they strode toward their destinations. People were busy. People didn’t care about the couple standing in the middle of the uneven sidewalk. People stirred around them like the sea, splashing against their ankles.

The man held her arms, his manicured fingers grasping hard.

Near the couple, there was a burned chair: garbage, darkened wood, charred remnants. That’s what had attracted my attention while I was leaving the building, the medical building, with the activated charcoal in my teeth—an abandoned chair all broken at the hips.

I imagined the impulse of someone purchasing a new chair, deciding to throw this old one away—picking it up with their knees bent and their lower back engaged, a contraction in the abdomen, separating it from their other possessions, and this object (made only for laziness or rest or gathering) being moved down a flight of wooden steps, being carried and offered to this sidewalk, sloppily, an old chair left to perish, and I imagined, too, the person who might have burned it, probably a man (men expect things to have violent ends) with a lighter or a match and the smell of a cigarette on his thumbs.

The dead chair was near the unmoving couple.

There was a balance there that I found significant, so I looked back and forth between them for six minutes, or seven. I knew the couple must have liked each other. They stared like children and kissed on the corners of their lips, and I knew.

If I followed the couple home, it was because of her hair. The building they entered was severe: red brick, steel, iron, and glass. Ugly. I waited to see what would become of them, now that they were inside a familiar place.

Time passed, and it began to rain. I thought of the burned chair sitting outside the medical building, the consequence of this location, its wooden frame peeling.

When the light turned on in the fourth window from the right, on the second floor, I felt relief. I became aroused. There was sweat, sweat on my nose, and my bowels were ready. There was water—the rain that was still coming down and the sweat that was still coming.

We were a triangle.

In the fourth window from the right, I saw pieces of them: the corner of a yellow painting, a bookcase filled to the brim, the light fixture, the tip of a houseplant’s leaf, a purple sofa, the blue walls, and then finally, finally her face in the window, her hair, her closed eyes, his hand wrapped around her neck like a scarf.

Hers was a plain face, really, as unremarkable as a piece of furniture. A face marked with freckles.

She had the most average of lips, the dark right eyebrow, and the left just as dark, long eyelashes, a nose with a bump in the middle as if it had been broken in childhood, the freckles covering her cheekbones like sand, and her resting eyelids.

I couldn’t see her eyes.

So I waited to see how long she would stay, unsmiling. The rain fell hard on my hands.

Her skin, her hair had distracted me.

It was the curl of it on her neck and on her forehead, the way it looked like a question mark, circuitous and pleading. It was the hair that had caused me to follow, to walk closely behind and wait on the street as they shuffled for their keys, the locks clicking and unclicking, their wrists turning, pressing their shoulders into doors, stumbling in, laughing, her name being called, Cannella, it sounded like Cannella, Can—cursing, letting the door slam, fast, fast up the flight of stairs, taking two steps at a time.

It made me stay longer than expected, and the rain wouldn’t stop. The rain continued. It felt heavy on my shoulders, and it rose. The water reached the backs of my knees, a flooding.

I did not think to leave, instead I walked back and forth in it, in front of the red brick, steel, iron, and glass building, her building, and in the middle of the street, which now looked like a swamp.

The gathering water rose to my thighs. It smelled of things in the moment before their dying. Objects floated past me—empty condom wrappers and large pears and extension cords, wet books full of soft paper (paper like cotton), nail clippers, peppermints, plastic spoons, dead mice, jars of unopened whipped honey. Rising water. This flood wasn’t like the ocean, but I pretended that it was. I kicked my legs. Waves formed, the current was taking me, and the rain wet my hands.

Floating, I looked at the fourth window from the right. The couple resembled a photograph, so still, the man’s manicured hand, his beautiful hand, on the neck of the woman, her eyes shut, and her dark eyebrows reaching up in mild surprise.

I don’t know how long she stayed like that, unmoving, but we must have been a sight to see—the current pulling, the thunder, me almost submerged, but looking up, up, staring at the glass, at this person with the closed eyes and the imploring hair, the neck, freckles everywhere, skin like a burned chair.","The story follows the narrator as they observe a couple standing still on a busy sidewalk.

Her husband has to frown because he notices his wife frown and because all the members of his family, it seems to him, are acting sad or are actually sad.

But the back door of the house has been opening and shutting often—and for the husband, the father, that sound hints at his idea of a happy summertime. That is the significance of that sound for him.

He is at that door as he follows Ariadne to where she is stretched out on a garden chaise longue, and a child or two of theirs is out there also, in the sandbox.

But, these days, his getting too close to Ariadne might result in a variety of symptoms for either one of them, ranging from moderate to severe to fatal—he must realize.

He puts his hands on Ariadne’s throat when she speaks to him, pinching it just enough to snap a stem, say, but not enough to kill a whole plant.

Then he returns to the house to escape her, but she finds him rather quickly to exhibit her spilling eyes and her tightened mouth.

But don’t ardor and rage amount to—usually appear—nearly the same? For the husband, at any rate, they do.

And when he takes into account their children—he thinks that perhaps they are not so sad, for what do they lack?

Today, the family’s sandbox is abundantly moist, wet enough for the children to be busy making cakes and digging gritty holes.

It is for the best that the twins enjoy stabbing at the sand. They are strengthening their finger and hand muscles with their toy shovels, and they absolutely relish listening to the grains of sand hiss.

The natural enthusiasm of this sand is so influential, so persuasive, as it is poked and sprayed and even knuckled under—or just played with a bit.","In this story, the husband and wife, Ariadne and the husband, are experiencing a period of sadness in their lives. The husband notices that everyone in their family seems to be acting sad or feeling sad. However, the sound of the back door opening and closing represents a happy summertime for the husband.

He follows Ariadne outside to the garden, where she is lying on a chaise longue, and their children are playing in the sandbox. But due to a current situation, the husband cannot get too close to Ariadne without the risk of causing harm to either one of them. He lightly puts his hands on her throat, symbolically representing the fragility of their relationship.

The husband retreats back into the house to escape the tense situation, but Ariadne quickly finds him, visibly upset. The husband contemplates the fine line between ardor and rage, realizing that they often appear similar. He also considers their children, thinking that perhaps they are not as sad because they lack the burden of adult responsibilities.

The family's sandbox is wet and moist, providing the children with ample opportunity to play and explore. The twins, in particular, enjoy stabbing at the sand and listening to the grains hiss. The enthusiasm and influence of the sand help to distract the children from the underlying sadness in their family.","In this story, the husband and wife, Ariadne and the unnamed husband, are experiencing sadness and tension in their relationship. Ariadne is frustrated with the sticky residue from washing dishes, which adds to her dismay. The husband notices that everyone in the family appears sad, including Ariadne, causing him to frown.

However, the sound of the back door opening and shutting reminds the husband of happy summertime memories. He follows Ariadne outside to find her relaxing on a garden chaise longue while their children play in the sandbox. The husband realizes that due to their current circumstances, getting too close to Ariadne could have detrimental consequences for both of them.

When Ariadne speaks to him, the husband places his hands around her throat but only applies enough pressure to break a stem. He then retreats back into the house to distance himself from her, but Ariadne quickly seeks him out, displaying her tear-filled eyes and tensed mouth.

The husband contemplates whether his feelings of intense passion and anger are essentially the same thing. He also considers their children and believes that they may not be as affected by the sadness in the family because they lack the same burdens.

Meanwhile, the children enjoy playing in the sandbox, which is wet enough for them to make cakes and dig holes. The husband appreciates that the twins energetically stab at the sand, strengthening their finger and hand muscles. The grains of sand hiss as they poke and spray them, creating a natural enthusiasm that the children delight in.",s20
Soft Sculpture,Lore Segal,"“My birthday party was in March,” Ilka told Bridget. The two old friends were walking on Riverside Drive at the turn of the season when you learn all over again that forty-nine degrees requires more than a jacket. “And I got what seemed an inspired present, a little . . . a . . . a . . . a what do you call the animal with the exoskeleton?” Ilka frowned, impatient and irritated at what was not, at that moment, available to her. “I always mean to figure how, routinely and with minimal fuss, to apologize for another word I can’t find in my head, cannot form in my mouth. Bridget, what’s the obvious—what is the first animal you think of that carries its roof so conveniently attached on its own back?”

“A tortoise,” said Bridget.

“A little tortoise,” Ilka said. “Eine kleine Schildkröte. I called it my Kröterl. That was the week of the Hitler takeover.”

Bridget had stopped and turned to her friend, who was saying, “No way am I going to remember which of the six or seven little girls brought what turned out to be an embarrassment. That thing sat and didn’t do anything. Just sat there. We shoved it, we pushed, we poked, we nudged. It withdrew its head under its roof and would not and would not move. My mother to the rescue. Mutti took all the children into the bathroom. You have to understand that this is a bathroom in Vienna and it’s the thirties. Mutti had to go find the matches and light the wall-mounted gas heater and warm two inches of water to cover the bottom of the tub, and she put in the Kröterl, which began immediately to march, and it marched round and round the bathtub at the speed of an Olympic footrace.

“The next day, the three Brown Shirts walked in and gave us twenty-four hours to be out of our apartment.” If Ilka frowned, it was to find herself, still and again rehearsing her ur-story.

When the ready tears that strangled Bridget’s throat allowed her to speak, she asked, “Where could you go?”

Ilka said, “They took me to Edith’s, a school friend. Mutti and Vati found beds with . . . people.”

Bridget was a writer with an indigestible Irish past of her own. Now she kept walking, alert to a fertile convergence in her understanding of the raw chill of a March day and the meaning of the word “apartment”: of having no choice but to leave a place where one was apart; of being without, that is outside walls of one’s own, and without a roof. Not to have a roof.

“And the tortoise?” Bridget asked Ilka. “Did you take it with you?”

Ilka thought, and she said, “I look back and I don’t see. . . . The Kröterl didn’t come to Edith’s with me.”

Bridget said, “But you remember walking out the door of your apartment? Did your mother take it? Did your father take the Kröterl?”

“What I remember,” Ilka said, “is the bathroom in our old apartment, mornings, my father sharpening his straight razor on the leather strop attached . . . was it to the doorknob? Sounds like Bluebeard—my poor Vati! And my recurring mishaps because I did not like to go into the bathroom after dark. My father’s terry-cloth robe, which hung on top of my mother’s robe behind the bathroom door, would put a ghostly sleeve on my shoulder.”

Bridget tended to invoke Henry James. She was trying to remember—what was it that James had said about a chatty old lady across the dinner table at one of those Victorian country weekends? The story of a dowager’s unwillingness to vacate the family home, the germ, if the old gossip would stop with the unusable detail—“the fatal futility of Fact,” James called it—that could be shaped into his next novel.

“Before Hitler,” Ilka was saying, “we used to summer in the mountains. I keep wanting to turn and ask my mother about the consignment of Enzian that followed us home—the blue, upturned bell of the gentian that grows as if without a stem from the ground. Who sent such a mass of these bluest blue flowers that the only place large enough was the bathtub?”

“Dead or alive,” worried Bridget. “The tortoise dead or alive must have gone somewhere.”

“When my kids were little,” Ilka said, “I got them a stuffed toy, a soft sculpture, a green Kröterl. The -erl ending is the Viennese diminutive; in German it would have been a Krötchen. It must still be somewhere around the apartment. It was a hand puppet. You could put your hand inside and make it draw its head back under its stuffed cotton roof.”

“Your e-mail,” Bridget said, “where I write you, is MyKroeterl38@usa.com.”

“That’s my address,” said Ilka.","Ilka and Bridget, old friends, are walking on Riverside Drive when Ilka remembers a story from her childhood. She recalls receiving a tortoise as a birthday present during the week of Hitler's takeover. The tortoise, named Kröterl, did not move until Ilka's mother placed it in warm water, after which it began to march around the bathtub. The next day, Ilka's family was given 24 hours to leave their apartment by the Brown Shirts. Ilka went to stay with a school friend, Edith, while her parents found beds with other people. Bridget sympathizes with Ilka's experience of losing her home and asks if she took the tortoise with her. Ilka is unsure but remembers her father sharpening his razor in the bathroom and her fear of going in after dark. Bridget reflects on the meaning of being without a roof and the significance of the tortoise. Ilka mentions a stuffed toy tortoise she got for her children, which she still has in her apartment. They discuss their email addresses, with Ilka's being MyKroeterl38@usa.com.","Ilka and Bridget, two old friends, are walking on Riverside Drive when Ilka remembers a story from her childhood.

Bridget sympathizes with Ilka's past struggles and asks if she took the tortoise with her when they left. Ilka cannot remember but shares memories of her father sharpening his razor in the bathroom, and her fear of the dark because of her father's robe hanging there.

Bridget reflects on the significance of losing one's home and the meaning of the word ""apartment."" Ilka continues her recollection, mentioning their summer trips to the mountains and a consignment of Enzian flowers that arrived at their home, filling the bathtub.

Bridget expresses concern about the fate of the tortoise, dead or alive, and where it went. Ilka mentions getting her children a stuffed toy tortoise, similar to the original Kröterl. The toy is still somewhere in her apartment, and its design allows for it to retract its head under its roof.

Symbols and Signs,Vladimir Nabokov,"For the fourth time in as many years, they were confronted with the problem of what birthday present to take to a young man who was incurably deranged in his mind. Desires he had none. Man-made objects were to him either hives of evil, vibrant with a malignant activity that he alone could perceive, or gross comforts for which no use could be found in his abstract world. After eliminating a number of articles that might offend him or frighten him (anything in the gadget line, for instance, was taboo), his parents chose a dainty and innocent trifle—a basket with ten different fruit jellies in ten little jars.

At the time of his birth, they had already been married for a long time; a score of years had elapsed, and now they were quite old. Her drab gray hair was pinned up carelessly. She wore cheap black dresses. Unlike other women of her age (such as Mrs. Sol, their next-door neighbor, whose face was all pink and mauve with paint and whose hat was a cluster of brookside flowers), she presented a naked white countenance to the faultfinding light of spring. Her husband, who in the old country had been a fairly successful businessman, was now, in New York, wholly dependent on his brother Isaac, a real American of almost forty years’ standing. They seldom saw Isaac and had nicknamed him the Prince.

That Friday, their son’s birthday, everything went wrong. The subway train lost its life current between two stations and for a quarter of an hour they could hear nothing but the dutiful beating of their hearts and the rustling of newspapers. The bus they had to take next was late and kept them waiting a long time on a street corner, and when it did come, it was crammed with garrulous high-school children. It began to rain as they walked up the brown path leading to the sanitarium. There they waited again, and instead of their boy, shuffling into the room, as he usually did (his poor face sullen, confused, ill-shaven, and blotched with acne), a nurse they knew and did not care for appeared at last and brightly explained that he had again attempted to take his life. He was all right, she said, but a visit from his parents might disturb him. The place was so miserably understaffed, and things got mislaid or mixed up so easily, that they decided not to leave their present in the office but to bring it to him next time they came.

Outside the building, she waited for her husband to open his umbrella and then took his arm. He kept clearing his throat, as he always did when he was upset. They reached the bus-stop shelter on the other side of the street and he closed his umbrella. A few feet away, under a swaying and dripping tree, a tiny unfledged bird was helplessly twitching in a puddle.

During the long ride to the subway station, she and her husband did not exchange a word, and every time she glanced at his old hands, clasped and twitching upon the handle of his umbrella, and saw their swollen veins and brown-spotted skin, she felt the mounting pressure of tears. As she looked around, trying to hook her mind onto something, it gave her a kind of soft shock, a mixture of compassion and wonder, to notice that one of the passengers—a girl with dark hair and grubby red toenails—was weeping on the shoulder of an older woman. Whom did that woman resemble? She resembled Rebecca Borisovna, whose daughter had married one of the Soloveichiks—in Minsk, years ago.

The last time the boy had tried to do it, his method had been, in the doctor’s words, a masterpiece of inventiveness; he would have succeeded had not an envious fellow-patient thought he was learning to fly and stopped him just in time. What he had really wanted to do was to tear a hole in his world and escape.

The system of his delusions had been the subject of an elaborate paper in a scientific monthly, which the doctor at the sanitarium had given to them to read. But long before that, she and her husband had puzzled it out for themselves. “Referential mania,” the article had called it. In these very rare cases, the patient imagines that everything happening around him is a veiled reference to his personality and existence. He excludes real people from the conspiracy, because he considers himself to be so much more intelligent than other men. Phenomenal nature shadows him wherever he goes. Clouds in the staring sky transmit to each other, by means of slow signs, incredibly detailed information regarding him. His in- most thoughts are discussed at nightfall, in manual alphabet, by darkly gesticulating trees. Pebbles or stains or sun flecks form patterns representing, in some awful way, messages that he must intercept. Everything is a cipher and of everything he is the theme. All around him, there are spies. Some of them are detached observers, like glass surfaces and still pools; others, such as coats in store windows, are prejudiced witnesses, lynchers at heart; others, again (running water, storms), are hysterical to the point of insanity, have a distorted opinion of him, and grotesquely misinterpret his actions. He must be always on his guard and devote every minute and module of life to the decoding of the undulation of things. The very air he exhales is indexed and filed away. If only the interest he provokes were limited to his immediate surroundings, but, alas, it is not! With distance, the torrents of wild scandal increase in volume and volubility. The silhouettes of his blood corpuscles, magnified a million times, flit over vast plains; and still farther away, great mountains of unbearable solidity and height sum up, in terms of granite and groaning firs, the ultimate truth of his being.

When they emerged from the thunder and foul air of the subway, the last dregs of the day were mixed with the street lights. She wanted to buy some fish for supper, so she handed him the basket of jelly jars, telling him to go home. Accordingly, he returned to their tenement house, walked up to the third landing, and then remembered he had given her his keys earlier in the day.

In silence he sat down on the steps and in silence rose when, some ten minutes later, she came trudging heavily up the stairs, smiling wanly and shaking her head in deprecation of her silliness. They entered their two-room flat and he at once went to the mirror. Straining the corners of his mouth apart by means of his thumbs, with a horrible, mask-like grimace, he removed his new, hopelessly uncomfortable dental plate. He read his Russian-language newspaper while she laid the table. Still reading, he ate the pale victuals that needed no teeth. She knew his moods and was also silent.

When he had gone to bed, she remained in the living room with her pack of soiled playing cards and her old photograph albums. Across the narrow courtyard, where the rain tinkled in the dark against some ash cans, windows were blandly alight, and in one of them a black-trousered man, with his hands clasped under his head and his elbows raised, could he seen lying supine on an untidy bed. She pulled the blind down and examined the photographs. As a baby, he looked more surprised than most babies. A photograph of a German maid they had had in Leipzig and her fat-faced fiancé fell out of a fold of the album. She turned the pages of the book: Minsk, the Revolution, Leipzig, Berlin, Leipzig again, a slanting house front, badly out of focus. Here was the boy when he was four years old, in a park, shyly, with puckered forehead, looking away from an eager squirrel, as he would have from any other stranger. Here was Aunt Rosa, a fussy, angular, wild-eyed old lady, who had lived in a tremulous world of bad news, bankruptcies, train accidents, and cancerous growths until the Germans put her to death, together with all the people she had worried about. The boy, aged six—that was when he drew wonderful birds with human hands and feet, and suffered from insomnia like a grown-up man. His cousin, now a famous chess player. The boy again, aged about eight, already hard to understand, afraid of the wallpaper in the passage, afraid of a certain picture in a book, which merely showed an idyllic landscape with rocks on a hillside and an old cart wheel hanging from the one branch of a leafless tree. Here he was at ten—the year they left Europe. She remembered the shame, the pity, the humiliating difficulties of the journey, and the ugly, vicious, backward children he was with in the special school where he had been placed after they arrived in America. And then came a time in his life, coinciding with a long convalescence after pneumonia, when those little phobias of his, which his parents had stubbornly regarded as the eccentricities of a prodigiously gifted child, hardened, as it were, into a dense tangle of logically interacting illusions, making them totally inaccessible to normal minds.

All this, and much more, she had accepted, for, after all, living does mean accepting the loss of one joy after another, not even joys in her case, mere possibilities of improvement. She thought of the recurrent waves of pain that for some reason or other she and her husband had had to endure; of the in visible giants hurting her boy in some unimaginable fashion; of the incalculable amount of tenderness contained in the world; of the fate of this tenderness, which is either crushed or wasted, or transformed into madness; of neglected children humming to themselves in unswept corners; of beautiful weeds that cannot hide from the farmer.

It was nearly midnight when, from the living room, she heard her husband moan, and presently he staggered in, wearing over his nightgown the old overcoat with the astrakhan collar that he much preferred to his nice blue bathrobe.

“I can’t sleep!” he cried.

“Why can’t you sleep?” she asked. “You were so tired.”

“I can’t sleep because I am dying,” he said, and lay down on the couch.

“Is it your stomach? Do you want me to call Dr. Solov?”

“No doctors, no doctors,” he moaned. “To the devil with doctors! We must get him out of there quick. Otherwise, we’ll be responsible.... Responsible!” He hurled himself into a sitting position, both feet on the floor, thumping his forehead with his clenched fist.

“All right,” she said quietly. “We will bring him home tomorrow morning.”

“I would like some tea,” said her husband and went out to the bathroom.

Bending with difficulty, she retrieved some playing cards and a photograph or two that had slipped to the floor—the knave of hearts, the nine of spades, the ace of spades, the maid Elsa and her bestial beau. He returned in high spirits, saying in a loud voice, “I have it all figured out. We will give him the bedroom. Each of us will spend part of the night near him and the other part on this couch. We will have the doctor see him at least twice a week. It does not matter what the Prince says. He won’t have much to say anyway, because it will come out cheaper.”

The telephone rang. It was an unusual hour for it to ring. He stood in the middle of the room, groping with his foot for one slipper that had come off, and childishly, toothlessly, gaped at his wife. Since she knew more English than he, she always attended to the calls.

”Can I speak to Charlie?” a girl’s dull little voice said to her now.

“What number do you want? . . . No. You have the wrong number.”

She put the receiver down gently and her hand went to her heart. “It frightened me,” she said.

He smiled a quick smile and immediately resumed his excited monologue. They would fetch him as soon as it was day. For his own protection, they would keep all the knives in a locked drawer. Even at his worst, he presented no danger to other people.

The telephone rang a second time.

The same toneless, anxious young voice asked for Charlie.

“You have the incorrect number. I will tell you what you are doing. You are turning the letter ‘o’ instead of the zero.” She hung up again.

They sat down to their unexpected, festive midnight tea. He sipped noisily; his face was flushed; every now and then he raised his glass with a circular motion, so as to make the sugar dissolve more thoroughly. The vein on the side of his bald head stood out conspicuously, and silvery bristles showed on his chin. The birthday present stood on the table. While she poured him another glass of tea, he put on his spectacles and reëxamined with pleasure the luminous yellow, green, and red little jars. His clumsy, moist lips spelled out their eloquent labels—apricot, grape, beach plum, quince. He had got to crab apple when the telephone rang again.","The story revolves around a couple who are faced with the dilemma of choosing a birthday present for their mentally deranged son. The son, who suffers from referential mania, believes that everything happening around him is a veiled reference to his personality and existence. Desires and man-made objects hold no meaning for him.

The couple, who are old and dependent on the husband's brother, decide to give their son a basket of fruit jellies for his birthday. However, when they arrive at the sanitarium where he is staying, they are informed that he has attempted suicide again and a visit from them might disturb him. They decide to bring the gift on their next visit.

On their way home, the couple faces a series of unfortunate events, including a delayed bus and rain. This leads to a moment of reflection for the wife as she observes the tears of a young girl on the bus. She is reminded of a woman from her past and contemplates the hardships and pain that life brings.

When they finally reach home, the husband, upset and unable to sleep, suggests bringing their son home the next morning. The wife agrees and comforts him. However, during their conversation, the telephone rings multiple times with someone asking for a person named Charlie, which leaves them both feeling unsettled.

Despite the challenges they face, the couple remains determined to bring their son home and provide him with the care and support he needs. The story highlights the unconditional love and resilience of the parents, as well as the difficulties they face in navigating their son's mental illness.","The story revolves around a husband and wife who are visiting their mentally ill son in a sanitarium on his birthday. The couple struggles to find an appropriate birthday gift for him, as he doesn't seem to have any desires or interests. They settle on a basket of fruit jellies.

The couple is portrayed as elderly and financially dependent on the husband's brother. The husband is described as a former businessman who has become reliant on his brother for support. The wife is characterized as plain and simple compared to the flashy, painted appearance of their neighbor, Mrs. Sol.

When they arrive at the sanitarium, they learn that their son has attempted to take his own life again and is not in a stable condition to receive visitors. They decide to bring him the gift on their next visit and leave empty-handed.

On their way home, the couple experiences a series of misfortunes, including a delayed bus and rain. The wife notices a bird in a puddle and feels a sense of compassion and wonder. On the subway, she observes a young girl crying on the shoulder of an older woman, which reminds her of her past in Minsk.

The story delves into the son's mental illness, referred to as ""referential mania."" He believes that everything around him is a reference to his own existence and personality, and that even inanimate objects and natural phenomena hold secret messages for him. The story explains that his delusions have been the subject of scientific study and that he considers himself more intelligent than others.

Upon returning home, the wife sends her husband inside while she waits outside due to the husband forgetting his keys. She reflects on her husband's difficulties and their son's illness, accepting the losses and pain they have endured. She considers the tenderness in the world and the potential for it to be wasted or transformed into madness.

When the husband eventually enters the apartment, he is unable to sleep and expresses a strong desire to bring their son home from the sanitarium. The wife agrees, and they make plans for their son's return and their own care for him.

The story ends with two phone calls interrupting their conversation. The wife answers and realizes that the calls are for someone named Charlie, not them. Despite the interruption, the husband and wife continue to enjoy their midnight tea together.",s22
Replacement Grandparent,Kate Zambreno,"Lately, she had found herself too exhausted to fantasize about sex, let alone find the time and physical autonomy to have it with the person she was supposed to have sex with, who lay his long body beside her at night, often with a little sighing body in between them, as somehow they had got out of the habit of putting the baby in the crib. She sometimes said to him that the only time she felt a spark of desire was when they were out in the world, and they encountered an older couple taking care of their young grandchildren, children similar ages to their own. This became their private joke, which she didn’t repeat to others, knowing that others would most likely just find it inappropriate or sad. That’s my pornography, she would say. To watch an older man, relatively fit, at a kindergartener’s birthday party, just bending over and picking something up. Ooh, yeah, Grandpa, she would whisper privately to her spouse. That’s right. Pick up that empty juice box. Slowly, slowly. Yeah, put it in the garbage can. Ooh. That’s right. Do it. Do it. Sit in that chair. Get up from that chair. Oh, fuck, you can pick her up? Pick her up. Pick up that five-year-old body. And so on. The joke had an undercurrent of melancholy and exhaustion, like so much of what she was feeling lately. Her elderly father was alive, but he lived far away, or she lived far away from him, she imagined he’d say, and there was a division between them, even when he visited, which he hadn’t for a while, because of his failing health, and also because of what was going on in the world. When her father came to visit, he sat in a chair, which he didn’t do very well, as he often had to be helped out of it. He couldn’t stand for long periods of time, and, when she had given him the baby to hold, his first time meeting her, six months after she was born, he’d almost dropped her. Everyone she knew, it seemed, had parents who were often and actively present, who would come and stay for a while in a spare room—another miracle, the guest room—or who sometimes even moved in order to be closer to their children and their children’s children. They were present, for birthday parties, for trick-or-treating, even for dance classes, soccer, and school pickups, like strange apparitions of help and care. Despite her jokes about her fantasy, sometimes the physical proximity of these grandparents made her feel unbearably alienated, even as she enjoyed making small talk with them. They were, more often than not, impressed by her and her accomplishments, which was so different from both her father and her in-laws, who regarded her as significant only for having produced grandchildren, whom they did not make extraordinary efforts to see, because they all disliked the city, were convinced they’d be murdered in broad daylight upon entering it, because of what they’d seen on the news. It made sense to have children if you knew that you would have someone to support you. In evolutionary terms, it turned out, this was called the “grandmother theory”: having a grandmother to help with the children had been promoting longevity and survival all the way back to the hunter-gatherer days. There were articles, in the Health and Aging section of the paper, about how to stay fit as you got older so that you could be present for your grandchildren. There was something about this that irritated her, the idea that she was supposed to stay healthy and sharp enough so that, at the end of her life, she could again find herself picking up after young children, without any wage or recompense, in this future and speculative identity of grandmother. As she was complaining about this, her friend suggested that perhaps what she needed was a replacement grandparent. Although the friend said this in a joking way, she found herself thinking about, even fantasizing about, this idea. Since her mother had been dead for twenty years, could she somehow find a replacement grandmother? Many cultures had the practice of hiring a designated mourner; a replacement grandmother would be something like that. Could she find someone to care if the baby had had a fever for five days, and to ask questions, and to check in? She couldn’t afford to hire a babysitter, even occasionally, so how could she possibly afford a replacement grandmother? But that was the thing: it would have to be a volunteer position, or it wouldn’t work. It would have to be someone who took an interest in the ordinary repetitions of her day, and who found her children special. But, for it to work, that person would have to know her, have intimate knowledge of her history, know even what she herself had been like as a small child. Otherwise the performance of love and devotion would feel empty, or artificial, like the rehearsed gestures of mourning. What she was longing for, she realized, was a ghost.","The protagonist of the story is a woman who is feeling exhausted and disconnected from her own sexuality. She jokes with her partner about finding older couples taking care of their grandchildren arousing, but this joke carries a hint of melancholy and weariness. She reflects on her own relationship with her elderly father, who lives far away and struggles with his health. She feels alienated when comparing herself to others whose parents are actively involved in their lives and their children's lives. The protagonist contemplates the concept of the ""grandmother theory,"" which suggests that having a grandmother present helps promote longevity and survival. However, she finds it irritating to think that she is expected to stay healthy and become a grandmother in the future without any compensation. A friend suggests that she find a replacement grandmother, someone who would care for her children and be involved in their lives. She considers the idea but realizes that it would have to be someone who intimately knows her history and genuinely cares, rather than a hired position. Ultimately, she longs for a ghost-like presence, someone who can provide the love and support she desires.","The protagonist of the story is a woman who is feeling exhausted and disconnected from her sexuality.

Snowstorm,Bruna Dantas Lobato,"Snow started to leave a tinge of lifelessness on everything, and I stopped going outside, stayed indoors as much as I could, in layers of fleece. Everyone left the campus for warmer places for the break, and I stayed there, in the dorm that looked like a milk carton, with its modern shape and single gable, never went anywhere too far from it.

In the afternoons, I worked at the campus mailroom, where I watched the stacks of letters grow, unopened. I put slim envelopes in their slots. I sorted Amazon deliveries, media mail, care packages in padded envelopes sent Priority from loving parents. Dubrowsky, Dunn, Dunton. There was intimacy in watching the movements of the campus, the coming and going, even in everyone’s absence.

Then, in the evenings, I went back to my room and read until I ran out of pages. Then I called my mom on Skype.

And have you been eating? she asked. Have you been going outside? Being careful out there? Washing your undies in the shower, like I taught you?

She worried about me all alone on campus. She worried about me in the dead of winter. She worried about me living so far away, alone in America.

She’d watched a movie about a couple of girls left behind at a boarding school upstate. The snow made the campus look bleak. Emma Roberts had dark circles under her eyes. Everyone died.

Don’t go down into the basement, she said. Avoid long hallways. Don’t go out late at night.

When she heard on the news that a snowstorm was passing through Vermont, she e-mailed me to ask if I needed company. A friend to marvel at the thunder with, she wrote.

I called her as soon as I woke up, before I ate my breakfast.

I’ve never seen a snowstorm, she said. She brought her face closer to the screen. Where is it?

It’s over, I said.

I showed her my window. The sky looked blank like a sheet, icicles hanging from the frame like teeth in a child’s drawing. Sunlight flooded the Webcam, and for a moment my corner of the screen was all white. I reappeared as a silhouette, and then as my full self again.

Call me if something happens, while it’s still happening, she said. I want to see it live.

Then she went on to list every storm fact she knew.

Sandstorms on Mars, other storms on the moon. Every tragedy on Earth. Floods, tsunamis, earthquakes. She talked until I had to say, Mom, it’s getting late. I have to get ready for work.

On a particularly cold day, I sent my mother a picture of the snow falling onto the soccer field out my window, which I knew she found serene, beautiful even, but this time she found it scary.

Does walking outside feel like being buried alive? she asked.

And I said that it didn’t, though the truth was that sometimes it did. I’d have to dust the snow off my shoulders and the creases in my coat before I walked in, my legs heavy, my jaw frozen, my hands burning.

She told me to stay indoors as much as I could, not to leave my room again until it was warm outside.

Then she shook her head.

No, don’t listen to me.

She yawned then looked past me, at something behind her screen. A lock of her hair fell on her eyes, and she didn’t move it away.

It was later there than where I was, way past midnight. I let her go to bed, and I stayed up, all the lights in my room still on.

I sat in front of the computer, wondering what I should do next, now that I was alone. The Victorian novels I had to read for the upcoming semester sat unopened on my desk. I felt it would take too much effort to enter their world that night, to move between Brazil and the United States and then England in the course of a day.

The computer screen went dark, and I saw my own face reflected in it. I looked pale and tired, papery, even, as if covered in mildew. I got up and splashed cold water on my face in the bathroom down the hall, then put on my coat and boots and went out on a walk.

From the middle of the soccer field, in the dark, I could see into my bedroom on the third floor, and into the bedrooms of my neighbors. A shadow moved across a room. Two girls laughed together in another, tilting back their heads, with no sound. In my room, the window framed a perfect image of stillness. The whole world seemed to quieten down for that moment, for me to look at what my life looks like.

I called her again when I thought she’d be awake, and her face glowed in the dark, lit up by nothing but the computer screen.

Were you asleep?

The light was giving me a headache, she said, and took her hand to her brow.

Everything gave her migraines in those days. She felt dizzy, her ears rang, her eyes twitched. To protect herself, she had to live in a world of blandness, often in silence, often in the dark, warm gauze over her eyes.

It occurred to me that she’d love the milk carton and the campus. The carpeted halls and the snow muffling every sound, the dining-hall food, the constant darkness, nighttime always spilling into mornings.

I told her this, and she said, Can you imagine? If the moment I got there and ate your food and slept on your bed and walked around in your clothes I was suddenly cured?

I told her about my walk to the soccer field.

She smiled and said, So it turns out you do listen to what I say.

I do, I do.

Just don’t go on these walks when it’s dark out, she said. Have you heard about the Filipino student who got murdered somewhere in New York last week? Not too far from you.

I laughed, happy that she was back to being so unmistakably herself.

When winter break was almost over, my mother e-mailed me to say that she’d received the package I’d sent her for Christmas, a few weeks too late, when I’d already forgotten about it.

On Skype, she waited with the box on her lap so we could open it together, her hands on my address.

I can’t believe this came all the way from America, she said.

She turned the box to the screen to show me the customs label I’d filled out.

Look, I’m touching your handwriting, she said. Might as well be touching your hand.

She cut the tape open with her kitchen shears and found the card I’d written for her, a brown dog running down a snowy hill.

Read it to me, I said.

Querida mãe, she said. Feliz Natal.

But then she couldn’t make out what the rest of it said.

Your handwriting has changed, she said. I can barely recognize it.

I don’t write in cursive anymore, I said. Not since I was a kid.

That’s it, she said. It’s very grownup now. I no longer see my little girl in it.

Show it to me and I’ll read it.

She placed the open card in front of the camera and I tried to make sense of what I’d written, but all I saw was a blur. Neat lines of blur.

She went through the rest of the contents of the box: a tiny bottle of maple syrup, a little bag of peppermint candy, a blue shawl.

She put the computer on the coffee table then stood up and draped the shawl over her shoulders, swaying from side to side.

It’s like a hug, she said. A cocoon.

She sat back down and curled up on the couch, covering the length of her body with it, the shawl as a blanket, all the way up to her chin.

Will you talk me to sleep?

I nodded, but then I couldn’t think of anything to say.

I thought maybe I could read her a story instead. Something soothing, nothing like the news.

I looked around my room for a book in Portuguese, something we could both understand, and then I realized there was nothing. All the books around me were in English, and every flyer, magazine, brochure. Even my own diaries.

Read in English, then, she said. I don’t mind. I just want to hear your voice.

She closed her eyes and waited, stroking the tassels at the edge of the shawl.

I grabbed one of the Victorian novels I’d been studying and opened it to a random page. I told her all it said about orphans, and fortunes, and fate.

I read for what felt like an hour. Twenty-eight pages’ worth of story.

Sometimes she nodded, until she didn’t, her lids shut, her head heavy over one shoulder.

And then what? Was I supposed to hang up on her, on my own mother?

I muted my mike and kept watch for most of the night. Her occasional stirs, her face glowing in the dark, her hair over her eyes. The restlessness of her sleep.","The protagonist, who is away at college, spends the winter break alone on campus while everyone else leaves for warmer places.

The Façade Renovation That’s Going Well,Weike Wang,"Between the exterior wall and the Sheetrock, a waterproofing layer was missing. The builders, in their defense, said that the layer had simply been forgotten about, not left out in an intentional move to save money. The building was faculty housing, occupied only by professors and their families. All but one professor were untenured. Half had kids under ten.

The layer had been found to be missing during a city inspection a decade ago. Repairs were put off for nine years. The school, as both employer and landlord, cited extreme busyness, and pointed out that, despite the missing barrier, no actual apartment floods had occurred. Year ten there was a global pandemic, but year ten was also the end of the remediation period, so construction had to start. The contractor hosted a virtual meeting to explain the many phases of the process. The slide show had several typos. “Demolition” became “demonition”; no apartment number was listed correctly. How disruptive would all this be, the dance professor asked, and the cherub-faced blond contractor’s spokesman answered politely, “Very much so, ma’am.” Then the chemistry professor chimed in about particulates. If the entire brick façade was being torn off, what was being done about air-quality control? The chemistry professor had small children. Small children had small lungs. The blond man said that they would tape over everyone’s windows. They would tape over the vents of everyone’s A.C.s. “So, no A.C.s or windows?” another professor asked. “All through summer, no opening windows or running A.C.s?” This professor, who taught biology and kept on the building’s rooftop a colony of honeybees, was not known to repeat himself. The blond man said that that was correct. And that the rooftop would be closed to accommodate the rigging, so the bee colony would have to be moved.

To better address the concerns of the tenants, a second virtual meeting was called, and predictably it went much worse.

The third virtual meeting was cancelled, and, a day later, scaffolding went up. Spaghetti-like ropes encased the building, and men in orange vests carrying hammer drills appeared on skinny platform lifts. Windows were covered with a neon-blue film that turned every room into an aquarium and gave tenants headaches. “No one’s complained about the blue film before,” the contractor said, though he then admitted to never having worked on an occupied building before. Clear film was procured four days later, the windows retaped.

The contractor did boast about having an on-site hygienist, a woman who was copied on e-mails but whom no one had met.

For three weeks, the noise level was terrible, from nine to five, Monday through Friday, with no pause. The new writing professor was trying to finish a novel but could only write things like “So this is what it must feel like to live inside a tooth that a dentist is trying to drill.” The tooth occupied her thoughts nightly. She hadn’t gone to the dentist in years. Red dust coated the window film; plumes of smoke were seen. The religion professor brought up the plumes, how, from her red-tinted window, they seemed cloudlike even. The contractor replied immediately, copying the hygienist, to clarify that what the professor saw was not a plume or anything close to a cloud but a puff of smoke being aggrandized by the wind.

Each morning, there was an e-mail update explaining which units would be most directly affected that day, though the apartment numbers were still incorrect. So, to figure out if you were truly going to be affected, you had to watch for where the huge mechanical pulley on the roof was dropping lifts. Glancing up at the building from the outside, the ceramics professor was reminded of his childhood, and that unwinnable arcade game with a bin of plush toys and a slippery claw. He was on the corner waiting for Mister Softee. He was waiting for Mister Softee because his three boys, who were inside, had told him to text them when the truck was in sight.

The technical term for what was missing was flashing—an embedded sheet of metal that prevents moisture from penetrating a building’s walls. Flashing is particularly important at junctions, around windows, vent pipes, etc. No one thought anymore of the word’s other meanings—committing indecent exposure, for example, running buck naked across a green field in a Superman cape, as the six-year-old son of the dance professor had done during his first soccer game.

Inclement weather set in one weekend, a hurricane muscling through from the south. Rain fell for three days and nights, and the history professor, whose apartment was right below the pulley, said it sounded as if it were raining within the walls. Could there be a leak? He sent the company an audio clip. The company responded a minute later. Leaks were impossible. They had sealed all the leaks because that was what they were here to do. Below the history professor lived a math professor, who all weekend had been collecting the water that had funnelled into her office through the ceiling. She used a one-gallon bucket, and she’d emptied the bucket into the bathtub five times. The math professor was married to the East Asian Studies professor. Not that ironically, the former was Asian and the latter white. Between gallons three and four, the former had drafted an angry e-mail to the school, but then stared at her unnuanced message. She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.

Over text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured resident—an economics professor—to declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. He’d left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.

Within the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the project’s architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the building’s foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the company’s scope. They dealt only with façades. Another company did foundations.

The next weekend, another storm front came through. Seven gallons, the math professor counted. In the history professor’s bedroom, a paint bubble, the height and width of a man, appeared on the wall overnight. He poked the bubble, afraid that it might actually be a person, like his department chair, and was sprayed, drenched, in brown water.

The professors lamented in the laundry room. What kind of collective e-mail to send, and in what tone? A seven-hundred-word one was drafted, with bulleted questions for further discussion. The e-mail was edited down to three hundred words, then ballooned again to a thousand.

“We must withhold rent,” the ethics professor said—a thought that gave the non-activist professors palpitations.

The walls of the water-filled units now felt spongy, and eventually a two-hundred-word e-mail was sent, signed by all the untenured professors, and ending with the sentence “We demand immediate action.” Within an hour, a fit young man arrived and handed everyone he met a business card. The card said that he was the vice-president of the company. The man noted the places where water was still seeping in. He said that there would likely be mold growth, and, should the mold be the color of soot, coal, or volcanic ash, they would need to call in the hygienist to culture it. Not all strains are toxic, he informed them. Some were perfectly O.K. In addition, he’d gone up to the roof and found no visible faults around the pulley system, so perhaps the leak was a preëxisting condition that had suddenly, coincidentally, got worse. “Things like this do happen,” he insisted, and added that, once the scaffolding was removed, the foundation would naturally rise up, against gravity, to its previous position. Then he tipped his hard hat at the professors and wished them a good day.

So construction went on unimpeded, and more storms came through, and more gallons were collected. Spores grew in the wet areas, none whose colors were quite right to be cultured. Rent was paid reliably; no more complaints were filed. In time, the professors all arrived at the same conclusion. Was the leak really that bad? On good days, it sounded like living next to a waterfall. Push through it, the way you did in grad school; then, once you get tenure, you can fly to Crete.","In this story, a group of professors and their families live in a faculty housing building that is undergoing construction due to a missing waterproofing layer. The missing layer had been discovered a decade ago but repairs were delayed. The construction process is disruptive, with incorrect information provided during virtual meetings and issues raised about air-quality control. The noise and dust from the construction make it difficult for the professors to work and live comfortably. During a hurricane, leaks are discovered in the building, but the company denies responsibility. The professors debate sending a collective email and withholding rent to demand immediate action. However, when a representative from the company visits, he downplays the issues and assures them that the problems will resolve themselves. The professors eventually decide to tolerate the ongoing construction and accept the leaks as a part of their lives. They question whether the leaks were really that bad and continue to pay rent without further complaints.","In this story, the residents of a faculty housing building discover that a waterproofing layer is missing from the exterior wall. The school, as both employer and landlord, had been aware of the issue for a decade but had delayed repairs. A construction project is finally initiated during a global pandemic, causing disruptions and concerns among the tenants.

The tenants attend virtual meetings with the contractor to address their concerns. However, the meetings prove to be unhelpful and even create more problems. Scaffolding is erected around the building, causing noise and discomfort for the residents. Window film is initially installed, causing headaches, but is later replaced with clear film.

Throughout the construction process, various issues arise, such as incorrect apartment numbers, plumes of smoke, and leaks during a hurricane. The tenants discuss taking action against the school, including withholding rent and hiring a lawyer, but these plans do not materialize.

Eventually, the construction continues with minimal complaints from the residents. They begin to question the severity of the leak and decide to endure it, believing that once they obtain tenure, they can escape the situation and enjoy their freedom. Despite the hardships, the professors continue with their daily lives, paying rent and resigning themselves to the ongoing inconvenience.",s25
Certain European Movies,Emma Cline,"They were trying to find the beach from the guidebook.
He’d bought the guidebook at the train station, some dutiful gesture on his way to the residency, but hadn’t even opened it.
She hadn’t known him then—when he bought the guidebook. Not that she really knew him now.
He insisted on using the guidebook to pick this beach, their last beach, like he could still make the purchase worthwhile.

The G.P.S. was on the car’s screen, the route marked in green.
He missed the turn on the roundabout. She didn’t say anything.
Another go-around. He made a quick, nervous veer for an exit, her water bottle rolling off the dashboard.
Am I going the right way, he said, his voice on the edge of a snap.
I know as much as you, she said. She must have sounded annoyed.
So this is what it would be like, he said. If this went on.
We’d hate each other?

They were going the right way. Or some version of the right way.
They drove past the beach they’d gone to before. Only twice in the past ten days, but enough that she thought of it as their usual beach, in the way that even the smallest temporary world takes on its own signposts and traditions.

He had been mostly quiet on those beach days. Reading printed-out articles, taking notes with a pen. His absorption was real. She imagined this is what his family might experience: his young child, his young wife. She nudged closer, took his shirtsleeve between her teeth then let it drop. He smiled in a far-off way.
For long stretches he swam in the ocean, leaving her on her towel.

Did you see me jump off the rock?
No, she hadn’t.
Did he notice she had gone in the water, too, that her hair was dripping?
No, he hadn’t.

Maybe she wanted it to be something other than what it was.
She pissed by his parked rental car, squatting in the dry grass, a man walking past with a dog off leash.

They’d brought beers and an opener and towels from the residency to that first beach—the house manager had been angry.
Those were bath towels, not to leave the house. There were other towels, specific towels, that residents were allowed to take to the beach.
The house manager didn’t pretend not to be exasperated with them. The house manager knew everything, knew exactly who was and who was not sleeping in their own bed. The towels were the least of it. People must have acted dumb all the time.

At night, the house manager sat in the hammock by the abandoned tennis court and called her family in Bolivia.

They parked in the lot. There weren’t many cars.
He wanted to bring the guidebook to the beach.
Right?
If you want, she said.
She didn’t say—why would you need the guidebook, exactly?
They started to walk along a paved road. It seemed clear, after a while, that it wasn’t the way.
There was a botanic garden back near the parking lot. The woman at the desk gave them directions in English.
This way, he said with certainty. She followed him. They hit a dead end.
I think she meant that first left.
He clomped along in his basketball shoes. The Europeans at the residency had made fun of them. Not unkindly. They shared their cigarettes. You smile a lot, they told him at dinner.
The dirt path grew steep and narrow. She picked her way down: she hadn’t realized how high up they were, how far the water was, until the cove appeared.
He took a photo with his phone. She took a photo of him taking a photo. Then her own photo of the cove. Later, they would both show the cove photos to the people waiting for them at home, the wife and the husband. Or that’s what she imagined.

The cove had an apron of concrete instead of a sandbank. The sun lit it up.
It wasn’t the beach from the guidebook—not even close.
Would either of them mention this was the wrong beach?
There was a couple in sunglasses sharing a blanket. Farther out, on the rocks, was a group of young people—they had beers, food, the pretty women going bare-breasted.
She would have paid them anything for a beer. If she had cash. If—
He went swimming. Wearing his long swim trunks. The Europeans said American men dressed like children.
The water rolled in with the barest energy, never quite becoming a wave.
He swam far across the cove. All the way to the other side.
She took her time getting in. Halting steps. The water was cold and clear. She stood up to her shoulders.
Come here, he called out to her.
She knew she wouldn’t swim to him. She dunked her head, anyway, doggy-paddled a bit.
She was a bad swimmer.
He was happy there, on the other side of the cove. On a rock in the full sun. He didn’t need her to join him. He called to her again. Whatever he said, she couldn’t make it out.

Already the sun was drifting toward the ridge—it was later than she thought.
She moved her towel to stay in the sun.
The group on the rocks was having a good time. She didn’t understand their Spanish, but she understood that part. They took turns jumping into the water, climbed out dripping. They didn’t bother with towels.
She almost asked them for a beer. Maybe if she were alone.

When she looked across the cove, she couldn’t see him. He’d swum out past the point, she guessed. She had her sunglasses and a book she didn’t read. She had barely read anything the past ten days. She had not worked. It seemed like no one else had, either, even the German.
She decided to take off her swimsuit top. Her breasts were pale, puckered from the cold water. She spread the top on a rock to dry and waited.

She heard him getting out of the water but didn’t open her eyes until he was right there.
Oh hi, he said.
Her nakedness embarrassed him in an appealing way. He was almost a decade younger than she was. She could see that he had always been a handsome man and that it had probably made his life worse. It made people want things from him.
He took a photo of her lying there, an arm covering her breasts. He’d delete it from his phone before he went home—she would remind him.

I miss you, he’d write to her later, back in the States, though the nights she went to his room he was nervous and spoke to the ceiling and they mostly just talked and he seemed relieved when she crept back to her own room.

Some mornings, the wind knocked over the wicker furniture on the patio and blew tree branches onto the cracked tennis court and everyone stayed indoors, waiting silently for their turn at the Nespresso, and that’s when she looked around and thought, Who are these people?

Their trains left the next morning. Different trains.
He would give her a ride to the station.
They would miss their trains, nearly.
He would run a red light, would act nonchalant.
The woman at the rental-car drop-off would snap at him. Her anger seemed outsized. Leave the keys in the car, she was saying. Leave the keys—it took them a while to understand.

His train would leave first. Already they would be shy with each other. He would walk down the train-station corridor, and she would watch him leave, become a body among other bodies that she did not know.

That was the next day, though.
Now, they drove back from the beach with the windows down. Her hair was almost dry. She could play music from her phone, as long as the cell service held out.
The old singers. Some country.
Some folks’ lives roll easy, please let me go round again.
Do I still figure in your life.
He didn’t know a lot of the songs. Did she have that album, he wanted to know, where Bob’s voice sounds so sweet?
Of course she did.
That one song, he said. The song—
Yeah.
—when Johnny Cash sings, too.

They drove along the fields. There were signs for other towns. The town with the museum, the town with the ceramics—she had seen none of it.
A line from an old story she’d read came to her.
The ending was sudden, as in certain European movies—that was the line. She couldn’t remember anything else about the story. Who had written it. What it had been about.
As in certain European movies.
As in certain—
And that poem someone had written for her once: she’d been twenty, he’d been—what? Much older. Probably her age now, funny to think.
Girl from the North Country, because she loved listening to that song.
She’s only twenty, only twenty, only twenty—that part of the poem had made her laugh. It wasn’t supposed to. But he’d probably written it in five minutes, who cared.
She’d liked the last line: This is the part where Johnny Cash comes in.

There was service till they got to the mountains. The road winding up into the green trees—that’s when the music stopped.
This is the part where Johnny Cash comes in, she thought. She looked out the window.
This is the part where —","A couple is on a trip to find a beach from a guidebook. The man had bought the guidebook but hadn't opened it, and the woman didn't really know him.

Battle,Weike Wang,"He is better at words. She is better at sentences. Games they like to play involve the former, and he wins the vast majority of them the vast majority of the time. Debates they find themselves in involve the latter, and there hasn’t been an occasion (on record) of him winning one for many, many years.

Crosswords, Scrabble, that new game with green and yellow squares, he excels at. Given six tries to guess a five-letter word, he is quicker to recall words without real vowels (she doesn’t support the idea that “Y” is a vowel), and he has the nerve to guess words with triple letters, like “fluff,” on the second try. Of course, she knows what fluff is. It’s either bullshit or the stuffing that comes out of cheap toys. But it’s not a word she would have guessed.

In defense of “Y” ’s vowelness, he asks, What about “lynx”?

Lynx? she replies, incredulous. When have you ever used that aloud? Oh, look, over there, that lynx is about to pounce and rip out my heart! She is certain that any person in such a scenario would use the word “bobcat.”

What most infuriates her is the presumption that she must be a whiz at words given her vocation as a writer of books. She is gifted calendar crossword puzzles (yes, three hundred and sixty-five tiny crosswords, one sheet for each day) every December, and is often dragged into long bouts of Words with Friends. In one game, he scores more than seventy points with a well-placed “Q.” She loses that game soon enough and texts him, You’re always doing stuff like that, calculating the value of each word. But that’s how you play—those are the rules, he replies. She calls into question these rules: is the point system for letters really based on frequency, or is it some larger institutional metric of mind control? He repeats, But those are the rules. On her darkest of writing days, she takes the last sentence she wrote and tallies it up for points. She is immensely disappointed. Then she stares at those crossword calendars, and they stare back. The five she was gifted this holiday season, plus several from last year. They sit all over her desk like blind cats. Hundreds if not thousands of empty squares.

She wonders why she is so bad at word games and has convinced herself that it’s because she knows too many words. Also, writers don’t like to be told what to write. A four-letter word for sleeveless garment, today’s crossword demands. But why is it “tank” and not “vest”?

His vocation is probably important: a computer scientist, a programmer, a coder. His work involves numbers and really simple words like “input,” “print,” or “run.” Coding also involves punctuation, which she is terrible at. An English teacher once asked her if she’d ever met a comma in her life. A comma after every fourth word is how she does it, regardless of what the word is (the answer to her teacher’s question being no), and thank God for copy editors. He is skilled with commas, semicolons, dashes, and slashes, and spends most of the workweek combing through code for a misplaced parenthesis that has misfired an array. Arrays are built into other arrays. Macros built into other macros.

I don’t think I can write a sentence like that, she thinks. A sentence nestled into another, like whatever that turducken dish is, or, more simply, like an onion, the five-letter word she did not guess on the day it was the word to guess. Being the same on either side, the word “onion” is an onion, the “i” bisecting it like a core. She texts him this amazing realization, only to thereby reveal the answer to the word game before he has had a chance to play. He texts back, Thanks, what unexpected luck.

He is also better at phrases, especially at guessing them when they are hidden behind white cubes. He was raised on “Wheel of Fortune,” and, whenever they watch that program together, he shouts at the people inside the television, Why are you buying vowels? His favorite category is Before and After, or, to her, the category of nonsensical phrases. “New baby buggy,” for instance. She keeps getting stuck on the chronology. Isn’t a baby by default new? And buggy, an outdated term for the first motorized vehicles with open tops? The Model T was a buggy, wasn’t it? So, on the time line of existence, an old car should come before a new baby. That’s not how any of this works, he replies. But, now that they’ve touched on the chicken-and-egg problem, they have to persist. She accepts that words came before the sentence, but argues that, in the same way calculus was invented to serve physics, words were created to construct sentences. The selection and sequence of words constitute meaning. The sentence is the final boss. After thinking that over, he says, But I like calculus, and she says, Which is fine. Great, even! There’s nothing wrong with calculus. She pats him on the arm.

It’s called having “the last word,” not “the last sentence.” So we can’t end there, with her patting him on the arm and going on and on about sentences. A piece of trivia dislodges in his brain: “calculus” comes from the Latin for small pebble. Pebbles as used on an abacus, to count out money, votes, and distances. In medicine, the word is still used for a solid mass made from mineral salts that can form in organs or ducts. A kidney stone is a calculus. A kidney stone can cause great pain. In high school, everyone sat in metal chairs and had sore backs. Everyone groaned about calculus homework; everyone complained to the teacher, including him. But how he loved the look of the integral sign, like the curve of a beautiful neck or a musical staff.","The story revolves around a couple who have different strengths when it comes to language and games. The man excels at word games like crosswords and Scrabble, often winning with his ability to recall obscure words and use high-scoring letters strategically. He even questions the classification of ""Y"" as a vowel. The woman, on the other hand, dislikes being pigeonholed as a wordsmith due to her profession as a writer. She struggles with word games, feeling that her extensive vocabulary hinders her ability to guess the simpler answers. She questions the rules and point systems of word games, wondering if they are a form of mind control.

The man's profession as a computer scientist contrasts with the woman's literary background. He is skilled with coding and programming, using punctuation effectively in his work. In contrast, the woman admits to struggling with punctuation, relying on copy editors to correct her mistakes. She envies his ability to construct complex sentences and arrays in his coding work, feeling inadequate in comparison.

The couple's differing abilities extend to other games as well. The man excels at guessing phrases in games like ""Wheel of Fortune,"" while the woman questions the logic behind certain phrases and categories. They engage in playful debates about the importance of words versus sentences, with the woman arguing that words were created to serve sentences and convey meaning. The man, however, enjoys the intricacies of calculus and finds beauty in mathematical symbols.

The story ends with a piece of trivia about the word ""calculus,"" which means a small pebble and is associated with counting and solid masses. The man reflects on his love for calculus despite the complaints and struggles he faced with it in high school, comparing it to the beauty of a neck or a musical staff.

Overall, the story explores the dynamics between the couple's different language skills and their playful debates about the importance of words and sentences. It highlights their contrasting strengths and interests, showcasing their unique perspectives on language and games.","The story revolves around two characters: he, who is better at words, and she, who is better at sentences. They engage in various word games, and he consistently outperforms her in games involving words, such as crosswords and Scrabble. He excels at recalling words with unusual letter combinations and triple letters, while she often struggles and feels frustrated. She resents the assumption that she, as a writer, should excel at word games. Her vocation as a writer of books does not necessarily mean she is a master at word games.

On the other hand, he excels at phrases and guessing them when they are hidden in games like ""Wheel of Fortune."" He grew up watching the show and often questions why contestants waste their money on vowels. They have a playful debate about the meaning and sequence of words and sentences. She argues that words were created to construct sentences and give them meaning, while he enjoys the logic and structure of calculus, drawing a parallel between calculus and constructing sentences.

As they explore the topic, he shares a trivia about the word ""calculus"" being derived from the Latin word for small pebble. This leads them to discuss kidney stones, which are also referred to as calculi. The story ends with him reflecting on his admiration for the integral sign, comparing its beauty to a graceful neck or a musical staff.

Throughout the story, the characters' personalities and strengths are highlighted. He is depicted as highly skilled with words and phrases, often outperforming her in word games. Meanwhile, she is portrayed as more focused on the construction and meaning of sentences, struggling with word games but excelling in her writing vocation. Their dynamic is playful and showcases their different strengths and perspectives on language and games.",s27
Woman to Woman,Honorée Fanonne Jeffers,"It was a Friday in spring when Norman, exhausted from dealing with Barbara-Pam and her jagged words, drove his pickup to the American Legion to meet his best friend. There were two women sitting at the table with Bo. Floretta was nudging Cloletha’s shoulder. Both were snapping their fingers to a jukebox song. Norman bought four beers and then sat down with them.

In Chicasetta, time hadn’t so much passed as crept out Norman’s back door. He and Barbara-Pam had grown up together in the same church and had attended the same segregated schools. Barbara-Pam’s mama was a widow, but, when men tried to court her, she’d tell them she’d had herself a good love. She didn’t need nary other. And Barbara-Pam wanted that kind of man, like her daddy had been to her mama.

She’d caught Norman’s eye when he was sixteen. He was good-looking, muscular, and knew it. Bo was his ace and full of laughter until he got called up to Vietnam, after graduation. But nineteen was still just an idea that year, and those boys walked the halls of the Negro high school like they were kings in a land where dark skin equalled royalty.

Barbara-Pam was pretty back in high school, but so was Floretta. Or maybe Floretta was just all right. Who knew? You couldn’t take your eyes off them big legs, and, if you tried to lift your gaze, there was that nice, round behind. Floretta’s mama was a widow, too, of a sort. The man who’d gotten her pregnant had gone to the electric chair. She insisted they’d been headed to the altar, but couldn’t nobody verify that story. The mother and daughter went to church at Mt. Calvary, where the siddity Negroes worshipped and sang true hymns, instead of lining-out spirituals.

The tension between what Floretta promised behind the high school and what Barbara-Pam pretended she didn’t know existed had eventually made the choice for Norman. But Barbara-Pam’s shyness gave way two years after they were married. She climbed on top of him, and he found he was disappointed in her pleasure. She was not as pristine as he’d thought. She’d simply been ignorant.

The years abandoned Norman. He was in his thirties, past his Jesus year. He was a deacon at his and Barbara-Pam’s church, where his father had served in the same pious role. When Norman opened the back door of his house, no unexpected tremors greeted him. Barbara-Pam rolled up her hair at night with pink curlers and wore flowered housedresses that reminded Norman of his own mama, an antidote to any man’s rising nature.

That night at the Legion, Norman put the beers down on the table, but Bo and Cloletha rose and left, holding hands. Floretta didn’t even look toward the door where the two had departed. She swayed in her seat and mouthed the words along to “Woman to Woman.” She told Norman that this was her song.

Everybody in town knew that Bo was married and didn’t have no business with Cloletha, but Bo was Norman’s best friend. Bo had changed and gone quiet after coming back from the war. Still, an ace was for life. You had to stay with him, or else what was honor? Wasn’t that the meaning of a friendship stronger than the bones that held your gore and spirit? Norman told himself that he was only sitting at the table to wait for Bo. That was all he intended.

But word travelled to Barbara-Pam that Floretta had slid onto the seat of her husband’s pickup, and they’d driven off into the dark. When Norman opened his front door, Barbara-Pam was waiting. She was tired, she said. Didn’t nothing seem to make him happy no more. He had a good, faithful woman and two little girls who were crazy about him, but he didn’t seem to care. She ordered him out, though the house was in his name.

Given the expense of divorce, he figured it was cheaper to keep Barbara-Pam, but he started living with Floretta full time. After a few years of private remonstrations from his minister, and his mama refusing to let him attend Sunday dinners at her house, which was only a few yards across the field from his technical dwelling, Norman compromised: he began spending a couple of nights a week with Barbara-Pam.

He got to thinking that all things were possible, like when he’d walked the halls of Chicasetta Colored High School. Like he was a man across the ocean in Africa, one who had a right to more than one wife. Whenever Barbara-Pam started in with her nagging, he’d remind her: Don’t get too feisty. Surprisingly, however, the loving had returned with Barbara-Pam. He began to enjoy it when she climbed on top. Also, there was the smothered cube steak she made for him on alternate Saturday nights.

Then Floretta’s baby boy came, and she started giving Norman a settling-down eye, and he decided Barbara-Pam was his choice. They had made vows in front of a preacher, it didn’t make no sense to keep bouncing back and forth, and, truth be told, Norman just couldn’t keep up no more. Their little boy had been walking for a month the Friday he packed the things he kept at Floretta’s place, but she didn’t cry. She told him, “Just ’cause the cock crow, don’t make the sun rise.” He thought about that for more days than he cared to admit, but he never could parse it through.

The Sunday morning after their true reconciliation, Norman reached for his wife, but she wasn’t in bed. He smelled sausage cooking: church mornings weren’t the same if there wasn’t pork on the table, and he sure hoped there were biscuits and grits as well. He quickly showered, dried off, then went to the closet, where he found that Barbara-Pam had splattered his deacon’s suits with bleach. Even his pride and joy, the maroon one with pointy-toed gaiters to match. Somehow, he’d been sound asleep while his woman had done this.

It took Norman two months to save enough for new church suits, and he was too old-fashioned to wear work clothes to Sunday services. On those heathen days, he’d drive to his old high school, which was now integrated. Not only law but custom had finally changed, and Norman didn’t even recognize the place. On school days, there were no loud boasts from boys, no girls fanning their bottoms. He sat in his truck and listened to the radio until he had to turn it off to save the battery. The paved parking lot wasn’t the dusty strip that had been there in Norman’s prime, in the right-handed kingdom of years past.","Norman, a middle-aged man living in the small town of Chicasetta, is married to Barbara-Pam, but is also involved with Floretta. Norman and Barbara-Pam grew up together and got married, but their relationship has grown distant over the years. Norman finds himself drawn to Floretta, who is also involved with his best friend, Bo. Norman and Floretta begin a relationship and Norman starts living with her, causing Barbara-Pam to kick him out of their home.

Norman continues his relationship with Floretta, but after a few years, he starts spending a couple of nights a week with Barbara-Pam. He begins to enjoy their intimate moments again and appreciates the meals she cooks for him. However, Floretta becomes pregnant with Norman's child and starts pressuring him to settle down with her. Norman decides to choose Barbara-Pam and ends his relationship with Floretta, who doesn't react emotionally.

Norman and Barbara-Pam reconcile and Norman feels content with his decision. However, one Sunday morning, he discovers that Barbara-Pam has ruined his deacon's suits with bleach. It takes him two months to save up for new suits, and during that time, he visits his old high school and reflects on the changes that have occurred over the years. The story ends with Norman sitting in his truck, reminiscing about the past.","Norman, exhausted from his troubled relationship with his wife Barbara-Pam, meets his best friend Bo at the American Legion. They join two women, Floretta and Cloletha, at the table. Norman reminisces about his past with Barbara-Pam and Floretta, two women who caught his attention back in high school. Eventually, the tension between Floretta's promises and Barbara-Pam's ignorance leads Norman to choose Barbara-Pam as his wife. However, Norman begins having an affair with Floretta and ends up living with her full time. He compromises by spending a few nights a week with Barbara-Pam. Norman starts thinking that having multiple wives, like a man in Africa, is possible. But when Floretta has a baby, she gives Norman a settled-down look, and he decides to choose Barbara-Pam again. After reconciling, Norman wakes up one Sunday morning to find that Barbara-Pam has bleached all his deacon suits. It takes him two months to save enough for new ones. Norman then spends his Sundays sitting in his truck, reminiscing about his high school days before integration changed everything.",s28
Anatoly,Oleh Sentsov,"Anatoly was given a seven-year sentence in a medium-security prison for wanting to blow up the Israeli Embassy and its Ambassador. It was difficult to understand exactly how the Jewish people had got on Anatoly’s bad side. Maybe Moses hadn’t been polite when asking Anatoly’s ancestors for directions to the promised land? Still, although Anatoly was filled with burning hatred for Jews, he didn’t admit his guilt in an assassination attempt. It wasn’t so much his conviction that upset him as the fact that he wasn’t put in a high-security prison, where, Anatoly believed, the real terrorists went. Terrorism, as a rule, is considered a serious crime that could earn you a strict sentence of life imprisonment, but for some reason the court decided to take pity on Anatoly. Either the criminal, in the court’s opinion, was not dangerous or the evidence was inconclusive. Or maybe the leniency was due to the fact that, as the state of Israel apparently noted in black and white in the accusation against him, there were no victims, no damage, and no claims.

Anatoly had been outed to the special services by a friend, who told them that Anatoly was planning to blow up the Israeli Embassy and its Ambassador and had invited him to participate in this exciting event. The friend also handed over some explosives and a flash drive with recordings of his conversations with Anatoly. Anatoly was arrested. He did not confess. The investigators checked the explosives for prints. There were some, but they belonged to Anatoly’s comrade, not him. The investigators listened to the conversations on the flash drive and discerned some indistinct muttering that led them to make broad conclusions about Anatoly’s fantasies, but there was nothing about preparing for an explosion. The only substantial evidence was his friend’s testimony, although the friendship was unlikely to survive such a turn of events. In court, Anatoly pleaded not guilty but delivered a fiery speech about the threat of Zionism to the world. The judge gave him a seven-year sentence because you never knew what could happen.

Anatoly was well over fifty. He had a wife and three boys. After the arrest, the youngest son, who was seven, waited a long time for his father to return from his business trip. He watched the news on TV, wishing for a quick end to the war in Donbas, which he believed was the reason his father could not come home—because it had stopped the trains from running. As usually happens with these sorts of cases, it was difficult to find the extremist. The judge is sure that the investigators wouldn’t just accuse anyone they come across, especially if the evidence is weak or nonexistent. The investigators work with the material that the field operatives have dug up, conferring on it an almost divine quality. The field operatives seize on any excuse to inflate the importance and existential necessity of their team. And this is how cases involving guys like Anatoly multiply all over Russia, while security forces receive orders and titles, TV channels scare their viewers with talk of terrorists, and the people shudder a little but then sigh in gratitude that such vigilant special-services officers are there to protect them. No one cares that, somewhere, a little boy waits for the trains to bring his father home from a business trip. Such is the state’s ruthless, repressive machine, which grinds up people’s futures. Well, at least the Putin regime has not yet resorted to mass executions—unlike the Stalinist one, when people disappeared into the unknown by the millions. Things were done quietly and in secret then, and everyone tiptoed in fear. Today’s Russia prefers show trials, to make people terrified of becoming one of those highly publicized examples.

Anatoly was of medium height, lean, and athletic for his age. He aimed to go to bed early, before lights-out if possible. To insure a good night’s sleep, he’d plug his ears with red paraffin wax that he had scraped from cheese rinds. He also wore a homemade black eye mask to block out any interference from the duty light. In this state of sensory deprivation, he’d set off to visit Morpheus. In the morning, he rose long before sunrise. Having unsealed his ears and removed his Zorro mask, he washed with cold water at the sink and began his yoga. Each new cellmate, upon waking, was horrified to see the life-threatening positions into which Uncle Tolya contorted himself, and rushed to save him. But there was no need for help: Anatoly unfurled himself independently. During his exercise time in the prison yard, he demonstrated how good he felt, raising his hands and greeting the sun with barely audible whispers, then racing around the cramped courtyard, practically running on the walls. When he was drenched with sweat, he would pause, still not out of breath, put on a special hat with a paper ball tied to it with string, and begin boxing furiously. Anatoly was a master of such homemade devices, and this was one of his most impressive. Even the guards, who had seen a lot in their lifetimes, would stop and watch from above, captivated, as Anatoly’s ball twirled around. He did little actual boxing, but, judging by the way he relentlessly attacked and defended himself from the ubiquitous ball, it was clear that he had his own unique style.

Anatoly didn’t smoke or have any vices, but he found a unique use for matches. He would burn bread crusts, using them to light or fumigate corners, and even creating fire circles in harmless Zoroastrian rituals. Anatoly was also studying Farsi—an interest perhaps born of his desire to check the Ayatollah Khomeini Telegram channel for the celebratory news that the Israeli Embassy had been bombed. His progress was slow, but, as Anatoly himself would say, “The language is several thousand years old,” so he was in no rush.

In many ways, Anatoly was a fairly typical inmate, but, as soon as the conversation shifted to the Jewish question, particularly when he himself redirected it there, his cell was filled with visions of Jewish Freemasons who controlled the world, weaving intricate plots and schemes with long-range goals beyond mere mortals’ comprehension. The main question for Anatoly was: How can we fight all this? And the first answer that came to his mind involved explosives.

Anatoly was a seasoned ideological combatant, well versed not only in the so-called Jewish world conspiracy but in the intricacies of Putin’s regime. For many years, he’d followed a crazy colonel who intended to overthrow Putin with the help of a couple of divisions that were loyal to him, plus tanks, submarine mini-boats in the Moscow River, and volunteers like Anatoly in a paramilitary organization named after Minin and Pozharsky. The uprising failed: either the tanks didn’t arrive on schedule or the submarines surfaced in the wrong place. The colonel was imprisoned for a long time, but he continued to direct appeals to his supporters and shower curses on the heads of his enemies.

In his youth, Anatoly had served in Soviet military intelligence. He was sent to Afghanistan as part of a newly formed Muslim battalion. He did not take part in the Tajbeg Palace assault, but he performed other feats to protect the interests of the Soviet Union in a distant and barren land. Anatoly talked a lot about his service, the exhausting training, the long marches in full gear in a-hundred-and-four-degree heat, his stupid fellow-soldiers, the local life, the war. He described how he had interrogated silent mujahideen fighters by inserting an explosive with a Bickford fuse into their ears. While the fuse was burning, the gift of speech usually returned. The stoic ones had half their heads blown off. Every war has its laws, none of which can be called entirely fair. Anatoly did not like to describe what the mujahideen did to the Soviet soldiers they captured.

He sincerely hated Putin for many reasons, including his attack on Ukraine, a country that Anatoly loved with all his heart and whose fate he now worried about from afar. It was not only because his wife was from there, or because they took a train there for a visit every summer, or because of the delicious food or the good people, and definitely not because of the freedom there after the Maidan Revolution, which he could not appreciate, sitting in his cramped cell. He loved Ukraine because it was dearer to him than his own, criminal country.

Once Anatoly had received his sentence but had not yet been sent to the prison camp, he was allowed a short meeting with his wife in a booth where they were separated by a pane of glass. He returned, pale, to his cell, sat on the bed, and stared at the wall. Two of his best friends, former colleagues, had gone to Donbas to fight for Ukraine and had been burned alive in a damaged Kamaz truck. Anatoly spoke, as if to himself: “And my wife, silly woman, came all dressed up and happy. She says, ‘It’s good you’re in prison, you old fool. Otherwise, you would have gone with them.’ ” Anatoly couldn’t contain himself and started to cry. That evening, he burned even more matches than usual.","Anatoly, a middle-aged man, has been sentenced to seven years in a medium-security prison for planning to blow up the Israeli Embassy and its Ambassador. Anatoly harbors a deep hatred for Jews, but he denies any involvement in the assassination attempt. Despite the seriousness of the crime, Anatoly is perplexed by the fact that he was not sent to a high-security prison, where he believes the ""real terrorists"" are held. The court may have shown leniency due to the lack of victims, damage, and claims associated with Anatoly's case.

Anatoly's arrest was the result of his friend's betrayal. The friend informed the authorities about Anatoly's plans and provided them with explosives and recordings of their conversations. Although Anatoly did not confess, the evidence against him was weak. The investigators found fingerprints on the explosives, but they belonged to Anatoly's friend, not him. The recordings only hinted at Anatoly's fantasies, without any mention of preparing for an explosion. The primary evidence against him was his friend's testimony, which strained their friendship. In court, Anatoly pleaded not guilty but delivered a fiery speech about the threat of Zionism. The judge sentenced him to seven years, citing the unpredictable nature of terrorism.

Anatoly is a family man with a wife and three sons. His youngest son, waiting for his father to return from a business trip, believes that the war in Donbas prevents his father's homecoming. Anatoly's case reflects the flawed system of accusing individuals without concrete evidence, as the investigators rely on field operatives' material to inflate their importance. The Russian security forces benefit from such cases, while the people remain grateful for their protection. However, the story highlights the human cost of such a system, as Anatoly's imprisonment separates him from his family.

In prison, Anatoly maintains a strict routine. He uses red paraffin wax to plug his ears, wears a black eye mask, and practices yoga before bed to ensure a good night's sleep. He wakes up early, washes with cold water, and performs yoga exercises. Anatoly impresses his cellmates with his flexibility, but his conversations often revolve around his conspiracy theories about Jewish Freemasons controlling the world. He believes that fighting against this perceived threat involves using explosives.

Anatoly is well-versed in conspiracy theories and has followed a colonel who aimed to overthrow Putin with the help of loyal divisions and volunteers like Anatoly. Although the uprising failed, the colonel continued to inspire his supporters from prison. Anatoly himself served in Soviet military intelligence and was deployed to Afghanistan. He talks about his experiences, including interrogating mujahideen fighters using explosives. Anatoly despises Putin, particularly for his actions in Ukraine, a country he loves dearly due to personal connections and his admiration for its people and freedom.

Before being sent to the prison camp, Anatoly has a brief meeting with his wife. She tells him that she is relieved he is in prison because he could have joined their friends who died fighting in Donbas. This revelation deeply affects Anatoly, and he cries uncontrollably. That evening, he burns more matches than usual, possibly as a way to cope with his emotions.

Overall, the story portrays Anatoly as a complex character with extreme beliefs and a deep sense of loyalty to Ukraine. His imprisonment and the betrayal of his friend have profound effects on his family and his own mental state.","Anatoly, a man filled with hatred towards Jews, is given a seven-year sentence in a medium-security prison for plotting to blow up the Israeli Embassy and its Ambassador. Anatoly believes that he should have been sent to a high-security prison, where he believes the ""real terrorists"" go.

Wolves,Sterling HolyWhiteMountain,"You won’t understand this. Me and my cousin were trying to learn the language, but there were . . . issues. Some people were with us, and some were against us. The former said anyone who wanted to learn should learn, we didn’t have time to waste, our mother tongue was dying. The others, they said we had too much white blood, we were not dark enough, we acted like we were too good for them! Man. Indian Country. The old guy said that long ago the people were pitiful and it was the wolves that showed us how to live with one another. The vision was one of compassion and order and beauty so fierce I could not grasp it. He told us the word for wolf. Mako’iyii. The old people, the ones who spoke the language, they had an interesting way of saying things. Even though they talked English, you could tell some other part of them was talking another language at the same time, one I should know, but don’t. I guess that’s just how things worked out, isn’t it.

The guy we were talking to, he was one of those old people who always wore a hat. My gram used to wear this bright-yellow broad-brimmed affair of woven straw. You could see her from way off, walking with her cane, and, if you went up to her, no matter how long it had been, she would demand a hug, and she was much stronger than you expected. It was like this. One old guy, he wore these glasses. I don’t know where he got them, they might have been the only pair of their kind on earth. This one time I saw him without them. For a second, I had no idea who he was. It’s not a hat, but you know what I’m saying. Those old people, they’re all gone now. I felt a freedom then, when I was at home and the mountains were there and the indescribable plains were there and the sunsets cast a light so serene over the land—you could think for a moment that everything was O.K. Sometimes, though, at night, I would wake in a proverbial cold sweat, and it seemed I had heard this howling sound, like the way wind sounds as it runs down and through a narrow canyon.

The old guy wore a black cowboy hat, and his face was dark brown and narrow with a long nose and heavy eyelids, and his lips were so dark they took on a purple hue, and he wore black sunglasses even indoors. You had this sense of import when you were around him, he was a line of dark energy running through a room. That’s how the truth feels. But there was this eagle feather in the hat band, and it was too big, it was obscene somehow, but seeing it made you smile. He might have been a cartoon, but then you talked to him and you understood why there was no in-between with him, people loved him or hated him. His hands were big and heavy-seeming and scarred, and he was always clasping them on the table in front of him. You could not look away. Like a lot of men his age, he had been a street fighter when he was young and even when he smiled there was a threat in it. The three of us usually talked at the casino, and the ones who were against us would see us, and they hated it because there was nothing they could say with him around. They didn’t know the language at all, or what they did know they mutilated like someone standing at a butcher’s block holding a cleaver for the first time. He was generous to their faces and laughed at them when they were gone.

Me and my cousin, we spent a lot of time with him, and learned about the old ways and how you might think about things now. There was a lot of talk, how things could be if only x and y. In the end, what I learned is that a language is a way of seeing, and there is almost no way to see in the old way now. Because of the feather, his appearance from a distance was jaunty, a word that has never been used to describe people where I am from. One time we asked him about this idea of indian blood and how we might talk about it in the language, and he thought for a while. He ran the pointer and middle fingers of one hand down the inside of the other forearm—strange how soft the inside of an arm is, you could cut a person wide open—and he said this phrase in the language. I can’t remember it anymore. He told us it meant the government was watching our blood. I felt again the colossal thing looming over us all. I guess you might call it history, but that’s not quite the word, is it. I wanted to throttle the thing with my bare hands, but the past is immune to even our most desperate aggressions and, anyway, I am not the type. The old guy’s last name was Wolf Striker. Or that’s how you say it in English. Sometimes when I was alone at night I would say it in the language—Mako’iyawakkii—and imagine myself in the same place but a very different time.

Listen to me for once. Here is how it works. You look at a thing, and then you look at something else, and when you look back the first thing is different somehow. A value makes its shape known only to the corner of your eye. One day I looked away from the old guy, and when I looked back it was his funeral. I got a call from my uncle. I had gone back to school, I was in a study carrel, reading a text on Indigenous plant medicines written by a professor from Sweden. I was broke, but my auntie gave me gas money to go home. The funeral was one of those things you may not see again. The priest had tried to come in, and there was a fight in front of the building where the bodies are put out, because the old guy had said there should be no priest. I knew why he said it, and I knew that I would say the same whenever my time was near. The church has had us in a choke hold for a long time now. Someone had one-punched Father Allen and laid him out flat on the sidewalk, and then another guy stepped in and really put the boots to him. You knew it was a story that would never go away, that cocksucker on the ground with his broken glasses, crying out, Please God! Inside, the old guy’s body was in the casket, and his arms were crossed over his chest, and his best boots, the black ones with the embroidered flowers, were on his feet, and the black cowboy hat was off to one side but the feather was missing. Some of the people who were against us were at the funeral, and they said how sorry they were he was gone they were so sorry they had never been this sorry. He was the last great speaker of our language, etc. I watched them go one by one to the mike near the casket, and while they spoke I invited my most murderous thoughts to join me. Then I dropped out of college. Phone calls, e-mails, letters came, even a text. (Hi K____! Your absence from Twentieth-Century U.S. History is noticeable. . . .) I ignored them all. There was nothing left in me. I told family and relatives the things he had taught me and my cousin. This idea of indian blood, I said, half this and a quarter that. It’s just more white-man bullshit. This isn’t our way! But no one cared. One of my cousins listened for a while and then bummed a twenty spot. When I went back to school the next year, I don’t know. There was this white girl in my tribal-sovereignty course. I tried to talk indian law with her, but she just wanted to talk traditional foods. One night she offered profound and considered commentary on the situation. You look white to me, she said. After that I thought often about taking her back to the reservation. We would go to Big Bear Alley, where everyone who lives on the street sleeps in the summer. I would say, This one here and that one there and this one over here who looks sorta like me—these are my relatives. Is that authentic enough, I would say. Does that meet your criteria, you fucking bitch.

The dreams came back for a while. I dropped out for good. Things really do end. Sometimes, when there is no moon and the soft starry arc of the mako’iyo”so’koi is cast across the sky like a mother’s arms and I cannot sleep, I drive to a spot on the flats where you can hear the wolves. I roll down my window and listen. They come sleek and systematic and regal down from the mountains and through the canyons, and some of them howl while the others assert themselves over the coyotes and ranch dogs who yelp and cry out in the dark. You would not believe the sound. In my head I can still hear his voice. Out on the flats it is an absolute slaughter.","The story revolves around the narrator and their cousin's attempt to learn their indigenous language. However, they face opposition from some people who believe they are not ""dark enough"" or are acting superior. The narrator recounts their interactions with an old man, who always wears a hat, and how he teaches them about the old ways and the importance of the language. The old man, named Wolf Striker, becomes a significant figure in their lives and is described as having a powerful presence. The narrator learns that language is a way of seeing the world and that the old ways are fading. They also discuss the concept of Indian blood and how the government monitors it. The story takes a darker turn when the narrator receives a call about the old man's funeral, where a fight breaks out between supporters and those against having a priest. The old man's body is in the casket, but the feather in his hat is missing. The narrator drops out of college and becomes disillusioned with their attempts to preserve their culture. They express their frustration towards a white girl in their class who questions their authenticity. The narrator experiences vivid dreams and eventually gives up on their education. The story ends with the narrator driving to a spot where they can hear wolves howling, finding solace in the sound and remembering the old man's voice.","The story revolves around the protagonist and his cousin's journey to learn their native language.

Blue Island,Stuart Dybek,"Let’s Walk

Uncle Romy told me that, if he hadn’t grown up on the inner-city street named Blue Island, he probably would never have dropped out of high school to join the Navy. Blue Island was within walking distance of the Ashland Avenue bridge, which spanned the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. It was a walk that Romy took from sixth grade on. He’d imagine that he was running away from home, escaping down a river like Huckleberry Finn, or going to live in secret like a hermit in one of the deserted little bridge-tender houses. He never tired of seeing the street split open as the bridge lifted its asphalt arms to the sky. He loved watching the rusty barges, heaped with demolished cars, floating by on river time, while street traffic waited, jammed bumper to bumper. At night, eruptions of acetylene-blue sparks and furnaces flaring behind charred foundry windows coated the oily water with visions of hellfire. But, even as a kid, Romy sensed that, if a toxic river flowing backward as it carried out the city’s sewage could enthrall him, then he needed to see the ocean as soon as possible.

The Navy taught him to box. When his tour of duty was over, he moved back to Chicago to fight in the annual Golden Gloves tournament, and made it to the welterweight finals. Romy wasn’t my godfather, but, given that we’d grown up in different generations in the same neighborhood, and were both southpaw welterweights, he appointed himself my guardian angel. That required him to teach me to box, or at least to try, which he did until I was able to convince him that getting repeatedly hit in the mouth was ruining my embouchure for the clarinet.

He also advised me in matters of the heart.

His advice for getting back with a girl you couldn’t forget was to call her out of the blue. Timing was important. It had to be in the evening, but early enough that you hadn’t lost the light. When she answered—if she answered—you’d say, “Let’s go walking.”

“And, whatever you do, skip the sad-ass Hi . . . it’s me moment, followed by a melodramatic pause, like you got some special status as me.”

“What if she asks where to?”

“Where what?”

“Is this something you’ve done yourself?” I asked him. It was hardly the first time I’d wondered about the backlog of secrets he kept stashed.

“That’s a story for another day. You need to stick to now,” he said. “You been out of touch so long, and suddenly silence has been broken, but you’re worried what next and want a backup plan, right?”

“It was just a simple question.”

“Right. So, if she asks where to, you want to be prepared to respond, like, Well, I thought maybe we could, like, go get hot beefs, wet, with both kinds of peppers, at Gino’s.”

“It doesn’t have to be Gino’s.”

“It doesn’t have to be anything, numbnuts. It’s not about fucking where to. It’s just let’s walk. If she wasn’t good with that already, she wouldn’t have answered your call.”
Factory Windows

We are walking in the cold. I know this taqueria on Twenty-sixth that features an assembly-line-like contraption that makes fresh corn tortillas. A sign claims that in the whole world only two such machines exist, one in Mexico City and the other here in Chicago. It reminds me of a similar setup I saw at the Café du Monde in New Orleans, where they make fresh beignets no matter the time of night.

But we have wandered into a part of the city where neither of us has been before, even though it feels familiar. There’s a saline smell of pilings that you might expect in a maritime city like New Orleans, but not in Chicago.

“Maybe you were here once as a kid,” she says, “back when you’d pedal around for hours on that red Sears bike, trying to get lost.”

“If I was here before, it was in another life.”

“You believe in past lives?”

“Believe? No. Even though sometimes it feels like it could be true.”

“That’s due to all the different lives we live during the one we think we have.”

We stop at the center of a bridge spanning the river and look down at a sheet of ice so thin that we can see the shapes of swimming fish below it. Carp, maybe, or catfish, bottom-feeders the ice has brought to the surface. The gulls see them, too, and dip past us, swirling and skimming over the frosted shadows just out of reach.

“Who knew there were still so many fish,” she says. “Didn’t this river once catch on fire?”

“They’re not fish you’d want to eat, unless one of your other lives was as a gull.”

The bridge crosses into blocks of deserted streets grooved by railroad tracks and lined with shuttered warehouses. We stop in front of what looks to be an abandoned factory with a “FOR RENT” sign taped to the door.

“Can you imagine what living here would be like?” I ask.

“Let’s go in and see.”

“There’s a lock.”

“That’s just cosmetic,” she says, and removes a glove, then slowly rotates the numbers she leans toward, as if listening for the tumblers. When it opens, she isn’t the least surprised. We glance around to be sure that no one is watching and push inside.

I expect it to be dark, but the tile floors gleam at the mouths of corridors, and a shaft of light suspending dust as if it were photons streams down the stairs. We begin to climb.

“How’d you guess the combination?”

“It’s always the same. Same as it was on my gym locker in high school, which was the same as the birthday in May of the first boy I had a crush on.”

“My birthday’s in April.”

“I know. He preceded you. Third grade, St. Casimir’s.”

“What was his name?”

“I don’t remember.”

“You remember his birthday but not his name?”

“Must be the kind of secret so sacred you keep it even from yourself. Know what I mean?” she asks.

We climb three flights and turn down a corridor that’s lined with chipped, cream-colored radiators. A bank of wired-glass windows gleams above them. Like the river, the windows are sheathed in a pane of ice. It has patched over all the cracked and broken places that shine a coppery pink through the frost, like wounds through gauze. Dusk shoots like laser beams through the bullet holes. The track of a push broom on the floor has shaped a tiny dune of shattered glass mottled with flakes of lead paint and bird droppings. We stare up into a skylight whitewashed by generations of pigeons.

“It feels like we’re in a story together,” she says.

“More like a poem.”

“What poem would that be?”

“Remember that old anthology of Chicago poets we used to page through for something to read at slams, Sandburg’s ‘the fog comes on little cat feet,’ Brooks’s ‘We Real Cool’? There was one by Vachel Lindsay about factory windows.”

“ ‘Factory windows are always broken,’ ” she says, reciting.

The words are amplified by the skylight, and she raises her voice so that it rings through the factory. Along corridors, the radiators begin to knock, more like someone demanding in or out than like applause.

    Somebody’s always throwing bricks,

    Somebody’s always heaving cinders,

    Playing ugly Yahoo tricks.

“There was more,” she says. “Another stanza about how nobody throws bricks through chapel windows, but I don’t remember the rhymes. I always thought that name Vachel was too cool.”

“So you remember Vachel and his immortal lines, but take the fifth when it comes to the name of your first love.”

“Casimir.”

“I thought that was the school?”

“They named it after him.”

The radiators stop their arrhythmic knocking. The windows above them no longer glow. The skylight has turned from whitewashed to bronzed. We’re losing the light. Earlier, when we crossed the river, the cries of gulls resonated through the girders as if the bridge were a giant tuning fork. We’ve yet to hear the pigeons.

“You’d think they’d be flying all over this place,” I tell her.

“I could live here,” she says. “I love steam heat.”

But there’s no heat. The only thing steaming is our breath.

“We’re losing the light,” I say.

“We could build a fire,” she says.

“Out of what?”

“The pages of the notebook you’ll be writing this down in.”

“They’d see it flickering behind the windows in the dark and come for us.”

“I’d hide in that fancy topcoat of yours. It’s reversible, isn’t it? You didn’t get that on Blue Island.”

“I bought it at Heathrow Airport so I could walk around London looking like I spoke the language.”

“You bought it because it was on sale.”

“It was my lucky day.”

“Factory windows are always broken, and clothes at airports are always on sale.”

I unbutton my coat, hold it open, and she steps close and presses against me, and, when I button it back up, you’d never know she’s inside.","The story follows the narrator's conversation and walk with a woman through the streets of Chicago. The narrator's uncle, Romy, is introduced as a significant figure in his life, having taught him to box and given him advice on relationships. Romy advises the narrator to call a girl he can't forget and ask her to go walking. The narrator and the woman wander into an unfamiliar part of the city, discussing past lives and memories. They stop on a bridge and observe fish swimming beneath the thin ice. They then come across an abandoned factory, where the woman effortlessly opens the locked door. Inside, they climb through the building, observing the broken windows and radiators. The woman recites a poem by Vachel Lindsay about factory windows, and the surroundings seem to respond with knocking and silence. They discuss the woman's first love and the absence of pigeons in the factory. As they realize they are losing light and warmth, they joke about building a fire and hiding in the narrator's coat. The story ends with the woman pressing against the narrator inside his coat.","The story revolves around the protagonist, who is reminiscing about his childhood in the neighborhood of Blue Island in Chicago. He has a close bond with his uncle Romy, who grew up on the same street. Romy dropped out of high school to join the Navy after being captivated by the sight of the Ashland Avenue bridge lifting for passing barges. After his time in the Navy, Romy becomes a boxer and mentors the protagonist, who shares his passion for boxing.

Romy also advises the protagonist on matters of the heart, suggesting that he call a girl out of the blue and ask her to go walking. The protagonist is unsure about this, but Romy encourages him to seize the opportunity. The girl agrees to go walking, and they embark on a journey through Chicago's unfamiliar neighborhoods. They stumble upon an abandoned factory and decide to explore it.

As they explore the factory, they find themselves intrigued by the broken factory windows and the beauty of the decaying building. They climb the stairs and wander through the corridors, witnessing the effects of time on the building. The girl recites a poem by Vachel Lindsay about factory windows and the brokenness of the world. The poem seems to resonate with their surroundings.

The Preparatory School,Hebe Uhart,"Driven by necessity, I accepted a position as a substitute Latin teacher at the National School of Buenos Aires, an élite preparatory school. I’d never thought that I would teach high-school Latin, although I was equipped to do so. As for the substitution: they didn’t explain if the teacher I was stepping in for was sick or had died or been fired; his absence sounded more like a time-out. It was not only time that seemed frozen; the school did, too. Something had sucked the air out of that place: at school functions, students did not breathe, and the teachers’ lounge featured enormous portraits of illustrious rectors, plus a gigantic one of a major naval battle. The teachers’ lounge was dark, as were the courtyards, and in those places I would sense disapproving looks aimed in my direction.

There was surely a modern methodology for teaching Latin, but that place prevented me from making any plans. I would go in terrified and feel calm again only once I was at least two blocks away. I felt that everything I did was wrong; my fear was a kind of animal fear, and I was just relieved that they didn’t beat me or lock me inside.

The school has always been a nest for fledgling leaders, dissidents, and success stories, but, at thirteen and fourteen years old, those kids were punished for any little thing; a security guard, who was said to work for the police, did not allow them to go to the bathroom during classroom hours, no exceptions. Those were the conditions I had to work in, and teaching Latin no less. The sentences my students translated went like this:

    The slave prepares a dinner of roasted eel for the lady.
    The dog must be obedient to his owner, the child to his parents.
    Young lady, put on the light-blue toga to honor our goddess.
    Caesar advances forty-five parasangs with his Army.

How far is a “parasang”? Whom could I ask?

    Young lady, you must put flowers on the goddess’s altar and cinnabar on Janus’.

What might “cinnabar” be? The students were going to fuck with me by asking, but neither I nor they actually wanted to know. Having made a fool of myself, I would leave the school still not knowing such things, and if, as I expected, some punishment were to be inflicted upon me, at least I would know the reason. The texts used such restrictive and cruel language; it was always an order, a demand, an altar for some goddess. But the passage I hated most was the one by Arria, the matron who, with great conviction, told her sick husband in one room that their son, who had died in another, was getting better and had eaten a hearty meal.

Since I taught Latin class from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M., I would lighten the mood by teaching Roman culture in the second hour and describing what the Romans ate.

One thing I always found odd about Roman cuisine was that one creature was cooked inside another. For example, you might find a goose inside a pig, and, inside the goose, a little chicken, all of this smeared in honey, the glue that kept it together.

I would say to my students, “How interesting!”

And they would reply, “Disgusting! Why are you telling us this—and right at noon!”

I also taught them that, in ancient Rome, people would toss everything in the streets—piss and all the rest. The lesson generated such an uproar that I wasn’t able to contain it. I was saved by the bell, but the security guard who was with the police still came in and stared at me. I fled to a café that was about five blocks away and not on my regular route; I wandered around like a lost puppy. When I sat down, the café seemed extraordinary to me, the street like a sanctuary, and the waiter a prince.","The protagonist of the story reluctantly takes up a position as a substitute Latin teacher at an elite preparatory school in Buenos Aires. The school is a prestigious institution but has a strange and unsettling atmosphere. The protagonist feels constantly judged and unable to connect with the students or the school's rigid culture.

Teaching Latin is a challenge for the protagonist, who is unfamiliar with the subject and lacks support or guidance from the school. The students are uninterested and rebellious, making it even harder for the protagonist to engage them. The protagonist struggles with translating ancient Latin sentences and dealing with the students' questions about unfamiliar terms and customs.

The oppressive environment of the school is further highlighted by the strict rules imposed on the students, such as being denied bathroom breaks during class time. The protagonist feels trapped and fearful, constantly making mistakes and facing potential punishment.

Despite the difficulties, the protagonist tries to lighten the mood by teaching the students about Roman culture and cuisine. However, even these attempts are met with disgust and resistance from the students. The protagonist finds solace in a nearby café, feeling a sense of relief and freedom when away from the school.

Overall, the story portrays the protagonist's struggle to navigate a challenging teaching environment and the oppressive atmosphere of the school. The character development revolves around the protagonist's feelings of fear, inadequacy, and the longing for escape.","The narrator reluctantly accepts a position as a substitute Latin teacher at an elite preparatory school in Buenos Aires. They feel out of place, as they never expected to teach high-school Latin. The school feels frozen and lacking in life, with disapproving looks from both students and teachers. The narrator struggles to find a modern teaching methodology for Latin in such an environment. The students face strict rules and punishments, even for minor offenses.

The narrator teaches Latin sentences that the students struggle to understand and translate. They feel embarrassed by their lack of knowledge and fear the students' mocking. The texts used in the class are restrictive and cruel, filled with orders and demands. The narrator particularly dislikes a passage about a matron who lies to her sick husband about their deceased son's health.

To lighten the mood, the narrator teaches the students about Roman culture and cuisine, including their practice of cooking one creature inside another. The students find this disgusting and question why the narrator is discussing it at lunchtime. The narrator also discusses ancient Roman habits of tossing waste in the streets, which causes an uproar in the classroom.

Overwhelmed by the negative atmosphere, the narrator escapes to a café, feeling a sense of relief and sanctuary.",s32
The Lottery,Shirley Jackson,"The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full-summer day; the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green. The people of the village began to gather in the square, between the post office and the bank, around ten o’clock; in some towns there were so many people that the lottery took two days and had to be started on June 26th, but in this village, where there were only about three hundred people, the whole lottery took only about two hours, so it could begin at ten o’clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner.

The children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous play, and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix—the villagers pronounced this name “Dellacroy”—eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at the boys, and the very small children rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.

Soon the men began to gather, surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother’s grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother.

The lottery was conducted—as were the square dances, the teen-age club, the Halloween program—by Mr. Summers, who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him, because he had no children and his wife was a scold. When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called, “Little late today, folks.” The postmaster, Mr. Graves, followed him, carrying a three-legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between themselves and the stool, and when Mr. Summers said, “Some of you fellows want to give me a hand?,” there was a hesitation before two men, Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers inside it.

The original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box now resting on the stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest man in town, was born. Mr. Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box, but no one liked to upset even as much tradition as was represented by the black box. There was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down to make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking again about a new box, but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything’s being done. The black box grew shabbier each year; by now it was no longer completely black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in some places faded or stained.

Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, held the black box securely on the stool until Mr. Summers had stirred the papers thoroughly with his hand. Because so much of the ritual had been forgotten or discarded, Mr. Summers had been successful in having slips of paper substituted for the chips of wood that had been used for generations. Chips of wood, Mr. Summers had argued, had been all very well when the village was tiny, but now that the population was more than three hundred and likely to keep on growing, it was necessary to use something that would fit more easily into the black box. The night before the lottery, Mr. Summers and Mr. Graves made up the slips of paper and put them into the box, and it was then taken to the safe of Mr. Summers’ coal company and locked up until Mr. Summers was ready to take it to the square next morning. The rest of the year, the box was put away, sometimes one place, sometimes another; it had spent one year in Mr. Graves’ barn and another year underfoot in the post office, and sometimes it was set on a shelf in the Martin grocery and left there.

There was a great deal of fussing to be done before Mr. Summers declared the lottery open. There were the lists to make up—of heads of families, heads of households in each family, members of each household in each family. There was the proper swearing-in of Mr. Summers by the postmaster, as the official of the lottery; at one time, some people remembered, there had been a recital of some sort, performed by the official of the lottery, a perfunctory, tuneless chant that had been rattled off duly each year; some people believed that the official of the lottery used to stand just so when he said or sang it, others believed that he was supposed to walk among the people, but years and years ago this part of the ritual had been allowed to lapse. There had been, also, a ritual salute, which the official of the lottery had had to use in addressing each person who came up to draw from the box, but this also had changed with time, until now it was felt necessary only for the official to speak to each person approaching. Mr. Summers was very good at all this; in his clean white shirt and blue jeans, with one hand resting carelessly on the black box, he seemed very proper and important as he talked interminably to Mr. Graves and the Martins.

Just as Mr. Summers finally left off talking and turned to the assembled villagers, Mrs. Hutchinson came hurriedly along the path to the square, her sweater thrown over her shoulders, and slid into place in the back of the crowd. “Clean forgot what day it was,” she said to Mrs. Delacroix, who stood next to her, and they both laughed softly. “Thought my old man was out back stacking wood,” Mrs. Hutchinson went on, “and then I looked out the window and the kids was gone, and then I remembered it was the twenty-seventh and came a-running.” She dried her hands on her apron, and Mrs. Delacroix said, “You’re in time, though. They’re still talking away up there.”

Mrs. Hutchinson craned her neck to see through the crowd and found her husband and children standing near the front. She tapped Mrs. Delacroix on the arm as a farewell and began to make her way through the crowd. The people separated good-humoredly to let her through; two or three people said, in voices just loud enough to be heard across the crowd, “Here comes your Mrs., Hutchinson,” and “Bill, she made it after all.” Mrs. Hutchinson reached her husband, and Mr. Summers, who had been waiting, said cheerfully, “Thought we were going to have to get on without you, Tessie.” Mrs. Hutchinson said, grinning, “Wouldn’t have me leave m’dishes in the sink, now, would you, Joe?,” and soft laughter ran through the crowd as the people stirred back into position after Mrs. Hutchinson’s arrival.

“Well, now,” Mr. Summers said soberly, “guess we better get started, get this over with, so’s we can go back to work. Anybody ain’t here?”

“Dunbar,” several people said. “Dunbar, Dunbar.”

Mr. Summers consulted his list. “Clyde Dunbar,” he said. “That’s right. He’s broke his leg, hasn’t he? Who’s drawing for him?”

“Me, I guess,” a woman said, and Mr. Summers turned to look at her. “Wife draws for her husband,” Mr. Summers said. “Don’t you have a grown boy to do it for you, Janey?” Although Mr. Summers and everyone else in the village knew the answer perfectly well, it was the business of the official of the lottery to ask such questions formally. Mr. Summers waited with an expression of polite interest while Mrs. Dunbar answered.

“Horace’s not but sixteen yet,” Mrs. Dunbar said regretfully. “Guess I gotta fill in for the old man this year.”

“Right,” Mr. Summers said. He made a note on the list he was holding. Then he asked, “Watson boy drawing this year?”

A tall boy in the crowd raised his hand. “Here,” he said. “I’m drawing for m’mother and me.” He blinked his eyes nervously and ducked his head as several voices in the crowd said things like “Good fellow, Jack,” and “Glad to see your mother’s got a man to do it.”

“Well,” Mr. Summers said, “guess that’s everyone. Old Man Warner make it?”

“Here,” a voice said, and Mr. Summers nodded.

A sudden hush fell on the crowd as Mr. Summers cleared his throat and looked at the list. “All ready?” he called. “Now, I’ll read the names—heads of families first—and the men come up and take a paper out of the box. Keep the paper folded in your hand without looking at it until everyone has had a turn. Everything clear?”

The people had done it so many times that they only half listened to the directions; most of them were quiet, wetting their lips, not looking around. Then Mr. Summers raised one hand high and said, “Adams.” A man disengaged himself from the crowd and came forward. “Hi, Steve,” Mr. Summers said, and Mr. Adams said, “Hi, Joe.” They grinned at one another humorlessly and nervously. Then Mr. Adams reached into the black box and took out a folded paper. He held it firmly by one corner as he turned and went hastily back to his place in the crowd, where he stood a little apart from his family, not looking down at his hand.

“Allen,” Mr. Summers said. “Anderson. . . . Bentham.”

“Seems like there’s no time at all between lotteries any more,” Mrs. Delacroix said to Mrs. Graves in the back row. “Seems like we got through with the last one only last week.”

“Time sure goes fast,” Mrs. Graves said.

“Clark. . . . Delacroix.”

“There goes my old man,” Mrs. Delacroix said. She held her breath while her husband went forward.

“Dunbar,” Mr. Summers said, and Mrs. Dunbar went steadily to the box while one of the women said, “Go on, Janey,” and another said, “There she goes.”

“We’re next,” Mrs. Graves said. She watched while Mr. Graves came around from the side of the box, greeted Mr. Summers gravely, and selected a slip of paper from the box. By now, all through the crowd there were men holding the small folded papers in their large hands, turning them over and over nervously. Mrs. Dunbar and her two sons stood together, Mrs. Dunbar holding the slip of paper.

“Harburt. . . . Hutchinson.”

“Get up there, Bill,” Mrs. Hutchinson said, and the people near her laughed.

“Jones.”

“They do say,” Mr. Adams said to Old Man Warner, who stood next to him, “that over in the north village they’re talking of giving up the lottery.”

Old Man Warner snorted. “Pack of crazy fools,” he said. “Listening to the young folks, nothing’s good enough for them. Next thing you know, they’ll be wanting to go back to living in caves, nobody work any more, live that way for a while. Used to be a saying about ‘Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon.’ First thing you know, we’d all be eating stewed chickweed and acorns. There’s always been a lottery,” he added petulantly. “Bad enough to see young Joe Summers up there joking with everybody.”

“Some places have already quit lotteries,” Mrs. Adams said.

“Nothing but trouble in that,” Old Man Warner said stoutly. “Pack of young fools.”

“Martin.” And Bobby Martin watched his father go forward. “Overdyke. . . . Percy.”

“I wish they’d hurry,” Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son. “I wish they’d hurry.”

“They’re almost through,” her son said.

“You get ready to run tell Dad,” Mrs. Dunbar said.

Mr. Summers called his own name and then stepped forward precisely and selected a slip from the box. Then he called, “Warner.”

“Seventy-seventh year I been in the lottery,” Old Man Warner said as he went through the crowd. “Seventy-seventh time.”

“Watson.” The tall boy came awkwardly through the crowd. Someone said, “Don’t be nervous, Jack,” and Mr. Summers said, “Take your time, son.”

“Zanini.”

After that, there was a long pause, a breathless pause, until Mr. Summers, holding his slip of paper in the air, said, “All right, fellows.” For a minute, no one moved, and then all the slips of paper were opened. Suddenly, all the women began to speak at once, saying, “Who is it?,” “Who’s got it?,” “Is it the Dunbars?,” “Is it the Watsons?” Then the voices began to say, “It’s Hutchinson. It’s Bill,” “Bill Hutchinson’s got it.”

“Go tell your father,” Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son.

People began to look around to see the Hutchinsons. Bill Hutchinson was standing quiet, staring down at the paper in his hand. Suddenly, Tessie Hutchinson shouted to Mr. Summers, “You didn’t give him time enough to take any paper he wanted. I saw you. It wasn’t fair!”

“Be a good sport, Tessie,” Mrs. Delacroix called, and Mrs. Graves said, “All of us took the same chance.”

“Shut up, Tessie,” Bill Hutchinson said.

“Well, everyone,” Mr. Summers said, “that was done pretty fast, and now we’ve got to be hurrying a little more to get done in time.” He consulted his next list. “Bill,” he said, “you draw for the Hutchinson family. You got any other households in the Hutchinsons?”

“There’s Don and Eva,” Mrs. Hutchinson yelled. “Make them take their chance!”

“Daughters draw with their husbands’ families, Tessie,” Mr. Summers said gently. “You know that as well as anyone else.”

“It wasn’t fair,” Tessie said.

“I guess not, Joe,” Bill Hutchinson said regretfully. “My daughter draws with her husband’s family, that’s only fair. And I’ve got no other family except the kids.”

“Then, as far as drawing for families is concerned, it’s you,” Mr. Summers said in explanation, “and as far as drawing for households is concerned, that’s you, too. Right?”

“Right,” Bill Hutchinson said.

“How many kids, Bill?” Mr. Summers asked formally.

“Three,” Bill Hutchinson said. “There’s Bill, Jr., and Nancy, and little Dave. And Tessie and me.”

“All right, then,” Mr. Summers said. “Harry, you got their tickets back?”

Mr. Graves nodded and held up the slips of paper. “Put them in the box, then,” Mr. Summers directed. “Take Bill’s and put it in.”

“I think we ought to start over,” Mrs. Hutchinson said, as quietly as she could. “I tell you it wasn’t fair. You didn’t give him time enough to choose. Everybody saw that.”

Mr. Graves had selected the five slips and put them in the box, and he dropped all the papers but those onto the ground, where the breeze caught them and lifted them off.

“Listen, everybody,” Mrs. Hutchinson was saying to the people around her.

“Ready, Bill?” Mr. Summers asked, and Bill Hutchinson, with one quick glance around at his wife and children, nodded.

“Remember,” Mr. Summers said, “take the slips and keep them folded until each person has taken one. Harry, you help little Dave.” Mr. Graves took the hand of the little boy, who came willingly with him up to the box. “Take a paper out of the box, Davy,” Mr. Summers said. Davy put his hand into the box and laughed. “Take just one paper,” Mr. Summers said. “Harry, you hold it for him.” Mr. Graves took the child’s hand and removed the folded paper from the tight fist and held it while little Dave stood next to him and looked up at him wonderingly.

“Nancy next,” Mr. Summers said. Nancy was twelve, and her school friends breathed heavily as she went forward, switching her skirt, and took a slip daintily from the box. “Bill, Jr.,” Mr. Summers said, and Billy, his face red and his feet overlarge, nearly knocked the box over as he got a paper out. “Tessie,” Mr. Summers said. She hesitated for a minute, looking around defiantly, and then set her lips and went up to the box. She snatched a paper out and held it behind her.

“Bill,” Mr. Summers said, and Bill Hutchinson reached into the box and felt around, bringing his hand out at last with the slip of paper in it.

The crowd was quiet. A girl whispered, “I hope it’s not Nancy,” and the sound of the whisper reached the edges of the crowd.

“It’s not the way it used to be,” Old Man Warner said clearly. “People ain’t the way they used to be.”

“All right,” Mr. Summers said. “Open the papers. Harry, you open little Dave’s.”

Mr. Graves opened the slip of paper and there was a general sigh through the crowd as he held it up and everyone could see that it was blank. Nancy and Bill, Jr., opened theirs at the same time, and both beamed and laughed, turning around to the crowd and holding their slips of paper above their heads.

“Tessie,” Mr. Summers said. There was a pause, and then Mr. Summers looked at Bill Hutchinson, and Bill unfolded his paper and showed it. It was blank.

“It’s Tessie,” Mr. Summers said, and his voice was hushed. “Show us her paper, Bill.”

Bill Hutchinson went over to his wife and forced the slip of paper out of her hand. It had a black spot on it, the black spot Mr. Summers had made the night before with the heavy pencil in the coal-company office. Bill Hutchinson held it up, and there was a stir in the crowd.

“All right, folks,” Mr. Summers said. “Let’s finish quickly.”

Although the villagers had forgotten the ritual and lost the original black box, they still remembered to use stones. The pile of stones the boys had made earlier was ready; there were stones on the ground with the blowing scraps of paper that had come out of the box. Mrs. Delacroix selected a stone so large she had to pick it up with both hands and turned to Mrs. Dunbar. “Come on,” she said. “Hurry up.”

Mrs. Dunbar had small stones in both hands, and she said, gasping for breath. “I can’t run at all. You’ll have to go ahead and I’ll catch up with you.”

The children had stones already, and someone gave little Davy Hutchinson a few pebbles.

Tessie Hutchinson was in the center of a cleared space by now, and she held her hands out desperately as the villagers moved in on her. “It isn’t fair,” she said. A stone hit her on the side of the head.

Old Man Warner was saying, “Come on, come on, everyone.” Steve Adams was in the front of the crowd of villagers, with Mrs. Graves beside him.

“It isn’t fair, it isn’t right,” Mrs. Hutchinson screamed, and then they were upon her.","On a clear summer day, the villagers of a small town gather in the square for the annual lottery. The children play and the adults engage in small talk as they wait for the lottery to begin. Mr. Summers, the organizer of the lottery, arrives with a black box containing slips of paper. The box is old and worn, but the tradition of using it has not been changed. Mr. Summers stirs the papers inside the box and explains that they now use paper slips instead of wooden chips. Each family head comes forward to draw a slip from the box.

One by one, the names are called, and the slips are drawn. The atmosphere is tense as the villagers wait to see who will draw the marked slip. Finally, it is revealed that Bill Hutchinson has drawn the marked slip. His wife, Tessie, protests, claiming that the process was unfair. However, the villagers ignore her pleas and begin to gather stones. Tessie is surrounded, and the villagers begin to stone her to death.

The story ends abruptly, leaving the reader shocked by the brutality of the lottery and the villagers' willingness to participate in the violence.","On the day of the lottery in a small village, the townspeople gather in the square. The children, recently out of school for the summer, gather together quietly before playing boisterously. The boys collect stones, and the girls talk amongst themselves. As the men and women arrive, they discuss various topics such as planting, rain, and taxes. The lottery is conducted by Mr. Summers, who is a round-faced and jovial man. The black box used for the lottery is old and worn, but no one wants to change it. Every year, Mr. Summers talks about making a new box, but it never happens. The lottery begins with the heads of each family drawing slips of paper from the box. The villagers are tense as the names are called, and as each family member draws a slip, they open it to reveal a blank sheet of paper except for one family. Tessie Hutchinson protests and claims the lottery isn't fair, but she is stoned to death by the rest of the villagers.",s33
LIKABLE,DEB OLIN UNFERTH,"She could see she was becoming a thoroughly unlikable person. Each time she opened her mouth she said something ugly, and whoever was nearby liked her a little less. These could be strangers, these could be people she loved, or people she knew only slightly whom she had hoped would one day be her friends. Even if she didn't say anything, even if all she did is seem a certain way, have a look on her face, or make a soft sound of reaction, it was always unlikable—except in the few cases that she fixed herself on being likable for the next four seconds (more than that was impossible) and sometimes that worked, but not always.

Why couldn't she be more likable? What was the problem? Did she just not enjoy the world anymore? Had the world gotten away from her? Had the world gotten worse? (Maybe, probably not. Or probably in some ways but not in the ways that were making her not like it). Did she not like herself? (Well, of course she didn't, but there was nothing new in that.)

Or had she become less likable simply by growing older—so that she might be doing the same thing she always did, but because she was now forty-one, not twenty, it had become unlikable because any woman doing something at forty-one is more unlikable than a woman doing it at twenty? And does she sense this? Does she know she is intrinsically less likable and instead of resisting, does she lean into it, as into a cold wind? Maybe (likely) she used to resist, but now she sees the futility, so each morning when she opens her mouth she is unlikable, proudly so, and each evening before sleep she is unlikable, and each day it goes on this way, she getting more unlikable by the hour, until one morning she will be so unlikable, inconveniently unlikable, that she will have to be shoved into a hole and left there.","The protagonist of the story is a woman who has become aware of her unlikable behavior. Every time she speaks, she says something ugly, causing people around her to dislike her more. This includes strangers, loved ones, and even potential friends. She realizes that even her non-verbal expressions or reactions are unlikable. She wonders why she can't be more likable and questions if she no longer enjoys the world or if the world has changed in a way that makes her not like it. She also questions if her own self-dislike is the root of the problem.

The woman considers the possibility that her age might be a factor in her unlikability. She wonders if doing the same things now, at forty-one years old, makes her more unlikable compared to when she was twenty. She ponders whether she is aware of this intrinsic unlikability and if she has embraced it rather than resisting it. She speculates that she might have previously resisted being unlikable but now sees the futility in doing so. As a result, she proudly embraces her unlikability, and each day she becomes more unlikable, accepting that one day she will become so unlikable that she will be discarded and left in a hole.","The protagonist of the story is experiencing a deep awareness of her own unlikability. Every time she speaks or even reacts, she notices that people around her like her less. It doesn't matter if they are strangers, loved ones, or potential friends; her demeanor and words seem to repel them. The protagonist questions why she cannot be more likable and wonders if she has lost her enjoyment of the world or if the world has changed in a way that no longer resonates with her. She ponders whether her age, now being forty-one, has made her actions and behaviors more unlikable compared to when she was younger. Despite not liking herself, she has embraced this unlikability, almost leaning into it like a cold wind. She embraces it each morning when she opens her mouth, and it continues throughout the day until she eventually becomes so unlikable that she believes she will ultimately be discarded and left in a metaphorical hole.",s34
Possession(s),John Smolens,"When your wife dies you find music tastes different and food sounds the same. You don’t walk, you creep. Some days you crawl. Others, best just to lie still. The closets are full of ghosts. Blouses she wore when she was twenty-six. A denim skirt. Killer dresses. Shoes—heels, pumps, a pair of Capezio tap shoes—entombed in boxes. When you open the closet door her coats hold still, suspecting they’re gonners. Threads of memory. She wore this one there, that one here. Every garment a chapter. The clothes of the dead have no future. You could burn them. You could leave them be, decades of sartorial history hanging from a pole sagging with the weight of remembrance. You could cross-dress with a vengeance. Everything Must Go. Not discarded, donated. To the Women’s Shelter, cartons and paper bags and piles of clothes, until the woman behind the counter says they’re overstocked. You’re tempted to take them all back. Who denies the donation of a dead woman’s clothes? The rest to St. Vincent DePaul’s, and there her cottons and linens and rayon blends are added to bins heaped with corduroy and polyester. (But for one satin nightgown that will not be donated.) Until the closets seem empty. Your clothes don’t count—they aren’t you, but just neglected shirts, pants, and jackets. As summer wanes, you open a drawer and find sweaters, scarves, wool hats and gloves. Gear for a woman who understood winter. You send sweaters and shawls and silk scarves to the women and girls in her family. They respond with photographs of ten year old daughters wrapped in blue for the fifth grade’s Colonial Day. Still you are possessed by possessions. Even after you dispossess yourself, they turn up in the kitchen drawers and cabinets, where she kept jars of dry goods, beans and grains, future meals. And there, in the freezer, plastic containers: soups, tomato sauce, chili. Nutritional messages from the afterlife. Hoard them. Defrost only as a last resort. Yet through the winter the freezer becomes as spacious and cold as your heart. By the time you open the last tub, labeled Black Bean Chili 3/14/10, food no longer has any meaning. It’s no longer an act of love, a gesture of kindness. There is no intimacy in tuna salad or in marinating chicken thighs. It’s embarrassing to recall how often you ate by candlelight; it’s like the satin nightgown tucked away in a drawer you never open. Instead just heat and serve. Just nuke it. Just eat. Overcooked sustenance. When you eat dinner right out of the skillet or pot, the temptation is to glance over your shoulder in shame. No one is watching, except the cookbooks. Shelves of cookbooks, back issues of Gourmet and Bon Appetit, and a three-ring binder stuffed with recipes, a culinary legacy handed down from grandmother to mother to daughter. Recipes written in her short hand, scrolls and waves and loops fetching across the page with an occasional word, a white cap of English. Instructions for future meals, for candlelight dinners, for guests. There are no recipes now, there are no guests; no need for the wedding china, the good tablecloth. Don’t forget Widower’s Rule #1: Never turn down a dinner invitation. You’re the guest now. And after dinner you walk about the house, speaking to the dark. Go ahead, come back and haunt me. Move the book on the table. Slam the bedroom door. Anything, I’m ready. Go ahead, I dare you. Scare me to death. I am ready. The reply is the deepest silence. Yet sometimes you feel her in the silence: nothing moves, no hinges creak, no lights flicker. Just her silence. Fuck you, Stephen Spielberg; death has no special effects. There is no possession, just possessions. To break the silence you play music. CDs in horizontal stacks; vertical rows of plastic jewel boxes, never properly alphabetized (as she so often suggested). Songs with melodies, lyrics, choruses, verses, movements, codas. Songs you can’t live without. Songs you’ll never listen to again. Songs you know by heart. Songs you want to forget. Songs you can’t forget. Songs for dinner, for reading, for dancing, for killing a bottle of wine, for making love. Songs to break the silence. Songs against eternal darkness. But one day (maybe) you’ll make a deal with the silence. You’ll sit in her grandparents’ chair and it will only be a chair. Or you could give it away. All of it. Everything. Everything except the stones. She was forever (or so it seemed) gathering beach stones. She’d return from a beach with her coat pockets sagging, doing her best Virginia Woolf. Round stones, egg-shaped stones, disk-shaped stones, stones ground smooth by water and time. Stones from England, Scotland, Ireland, Italy, Turkey, Cape Cod. Stones stored in shoe boxes, in plastic bags, in bowls; clusters of stones distributed about the house like incense. She liked the look of them, the feel of them, rattling in her palm. You could get rid of it all, but not the stones. You could walk on them, sleep on them, sit on them, eat off of them. Your house would be silent, filled with stones. You would have solitude. You would not be alone. You would have the stones.","The protagonist of the story is a widower who is struggling to cope with the loss of his wife. He describes how everything in his life has changed since her death. He feels as though music no longer brings him joy and that food has lost its taste. He moves through life in a slow and somber manner, sometimes crawling instead of walking.

The protagonist is haunted by the presence of his deceased wife in their home. He finds solace in her clothes, which he keeps in the closets. Each garment holds memories of her, and he contemplates whether to donate or keep them. Eventually, he decides to donate most of the clothes to women's shelters and charities, but keeps a satin nightgown as a memento.

Even after getting rid of his wife's possessions, the widower continues to find reminders of her in their home, such as sweaters and scarves. He gives these items to her family members but still feels overwhelmed by the memories of their life together.

The widower also finds himself surrounded by the remnants of his wife's presence in the kitchen. He discovers frozen meals and jars of dry goods she had stored. Despite the emotional significance these items hold, he begins to lose interest in cooking and finds no pleasure in preparing meals.

The protagonist's grief extends to other aspects of his life, such as entertaining guests. He no longer has a need for the wedding china or the good tablecloth. He also mentions the importance of accepting dinner invitations and being a guest rather than the host.

In his loneliness, the widower tries to communicate with his wife's spirit, inviting her to haunt him and scare him. However, he only finds silence in response. He criticizes the portrayal of death in movies and realizes that possessions cannot replace the absence of his wife.

To break the silence and find some solace, the widower turns to music. He has a vast collection of CDs that he plays to fill the void. However, he also acknowledges that there are songs he can no longer listen to because they remind him too much of his wife.

The widower contemplates the idea of letting go of all his possessions and starting anew, except for the stones that his wife collected from various beaches. These stones hold sentimental value and remind him of her. He imagines living in a silent house filled with these stones, finding solace and companionship in them.

The story explores the widower's journey through grief and the different ways he tries to cope with the loss of his wife. It delves into the profound impact of loss on one's daily life and the struggle to find meaning and solace in the face of immense sadness.","The story depicts the aftermath of the narrator's wife's death and how it affects their life and surroundings. The plot centers around the process of mourning and letting go of possessions, as well as the character's struggle with grief and loneliness.

The story begins with the narrator describing how everything feels different since their wife's passing. Music no longer brings the same pleasure, and food loses its taste. The character's physical movements reflect their emotional state, as they mention creeping, crawling, and lying still on different days. The presence of their wife's clothes in the closets serves as a constant reminder of her absence. Each garment holds memories, and the character contemplates whether to burn or donate them.

The character decides to donate the clothes to a Women's Shelter and St. Vincent DePaul's, but still finds remnants of their wife's belongings in the kitchen, such as dry goods and frozen meals. These possessions evoke feelings of loneliness and loss. The character's relationship with food changes, and the act of cooking loses its significance. They resort to quick, microwaveable meals, eating straight from the pot or skillet.

Cookbooks and recipes also hold sentimental value, representing a culinary legacy passed down through the family. However, without the presence of their wife or guests, the character feels no need for elaborate meals or fine dining. They adopt the Widower's Rule #1 of never turning down a dinner invitation and find solace in being a guest.

The story delves into the character's interactions with the silence left by their wife's absence. They address the darkness, daring it to scare them, but find only a profound silence in return. The character seeks solace in music, playing songs that were meaningful to them but also remind them of their loss. The music serves as a way to break the silence and fight against the eternal darkness.

Throughout the narrative, the character contemplates the idea of letting go. They consider giving away all their possessions, except for the stones their wife collected. These stones hold sentimental value and a connection to their wife, allowing the character to find solace and a sense of companionship. The story ends with the idea that keeping these stones would fill the house with solitude, but not leave the character alone.

Overall, the story explores the themes of loss, grief, and the process of moving forward after the death of a loved one. The character's journey involves confronting their emotions, relinquishing possessions, and finding solace in memories and the presence of their wife through cherished items.",s35
Ramona,Sarah Gerkensmeyer,"Ramona used to say, “When it’s on the outside I feel self-conscious.”

We did overnights at her house that summer. After finishing the sixth grade, we had stopped calling them sleepovers. Ramona had a full-sized bed, but I still felt scrunched up next to her when we were in it. We didn’t press into each other while we slept, but I think I felt pushed up against her because of what I knew about her heart. About how sometimes it flipped and somersaulted and somehow ended up on the outside of her skin, resting there on the wrong side of her body for a few seconds like a wild bird afraid to fly away but so eager to do it.

“When my family moved here, I was afraid I wouldn’t make a single friend.”

I told Ramona this while we were sitting out on her front steps at dusk, sucking on popsicles and bored out of our minds. We didn’t say it, but we were waiting for something big to happen. We were waiting for a boy to call and ask for one of us. Or better yet: for a boy—two of them!—to pass by Ramona’s house, trying to slouch their shoulders and barely nod while glancing our way. But half of the summer was dead already and neither of those things had happened.

“I thought meeting new people would be hard,” I said, chewing on my splintered popsicle stick. “And then bam, I met you.”

This wasn’t exactly true. I felt the urge to exaggerate things when I was around Ramona. I found myself making up little lies. I was the only person in the entire world who knew about her heart thing. I felt like I owed her something. I had nothing to confess, and so I made things up.

“I’m afraid of being abducted by aliens,” I lied.

“I shoplifted a bag of peanut M&Ms in the checkout line, standing right next to my mom,” I lied.

“Sheila Hastings is stupid. Her bangs are ugly,” I lied. “And I kicked her once in the hallway on the way to lunch.”

That summer, three bad things happened. Matt Gowen’s dad died of cancer. Tracy Turner’s dog Velvet got run over by a minivan. And then, at the beginning of August, Troy Benson’s little brother climbed into the baby pool and started to drown in only a few inches of water. The paramedics had to do CPR, and we all decided he’d be messed up forever after going through something like that.

“I wonder what it would be like if I started jogging,” Ramona said one night while we were sitting on her bed, painting our toenails lime green.

That’s all she said, but I knew exactly what she meant. Some girls our age had started jogging around the neighborhood in packs. It was the girls who had started to develop. They didn’t jog because it was healthy. They jogged so they could wear tight, neon-colored exercise clothes, the sudden swelling on their chests pushing out against bright elastic, tugging them forward along the streets of our neighborhood and into the rest of their lives. I knew that Ramona wanted to jog and see if her heart would push itself out while she was panting and sputtering. She’d have a bulge on her little chest then. Who cares if it was only on one side?  Imagine being with a boy, in a basement or a closet, and then that sudden beating on the outside of your chest. Imagine that he wouldn’t be grossed out at all. Imagine that he’d let out a moan, some unbelievable sound, because of the way your body was being right there in front of him. Ramona never confessed to any daydreams like that, but I knew she had them. I had them for her.

I practically lived at Ramona’s house that summer. Almost every night I was stretched out there on her bed, waiting for sleep and feeling the humidity press into every part of me like a secret I figured someday I might identify and then maybe understand.

“See,” she said the first time she showed me. “It’s like this.”

Ramona pulled her tank top up and there it was: a heart beating on the outside of her chest. I didn’t scream like I thought I would. I didn’t cover my eyes or gag or laugh uncontrollably. I just looked at it. I nodded my head. “Okay,” I said. And then I blinked or glanced at her face, and when I looked again it was already gone. She didn’t have her bra on. We had each bought the same size and the same style at the beginning of the summer, even though neither of us needed one yet. We hardly wore them when it was just the two of us lazing around her house, waiting for the world to happen. Ramona kept her tank top pulled up even after her heart had disappeared. I stared at her chest. It was creamy and bare and ordinary—no trace of the bloody, glistening muscle that had been galloping there only seconds before.

I miss Ramona. It’s a simple kind of missing. It’s the way vague regret and longing pool in your stomach when you shouldn’t be feeling anything at all—while pulling laundry out of the washer, while walking the dog, while reaching for something in the shower with your eyes squeezed shut. The two of us were careless and let whatever we had dissolve into a leftover pang of almost-nostalgia. Who knows where she is now?

“Turn your stomach inside out,” she said one night.

I was almost asleep. I opened my eyes up to the dark.

“What?”

“I mean, for real,” she said. There was that mean, annoyed flip that sometimes came out at the ends of her sentences.

“Like this,” she said. She turned on the little lamp next to her bed, and her heart was there again, beating and wet against the delicate V of her unbuttoned nightgown. The openings and valves and the whole mess of it sucked at the air like an angry, stranded fish.

I think about that heart late at night, my husband pressed here in bed next to me. I try to reach back into my childhood and pin lanky, eleven-year-old Ramona with eating disorders and depression and the hungry, open mouth of loneliness. But really, it was just that thing with her heart. That’s all. And I’m jealous. I still do it—lie here in bed and try to push things outside of myself. I’m jealous of any woman who has ever given birth. Think of it—something being forced out like that, gravity or fate or whatever it is pulling away at you like a stubborn, certain thing.","The story revolves around the friendship between the narrator and her friend Ramona.

Riddle,Ogbewe Amadin,"I think Aunty Adesuwa is a witch. Mama says so sometimes.

“What is a witch?” I asked Mama once.

“A witch is an unusual person. They are different from normal people,” Mama told me.

“People call me different. Am I a witch too?” I asked.

“Idara, you are not a witch, okay?!” Mama said. “You are a kind and sweet little girl and when I’m done with you, you will be a strong, independent woman,” she told me, holding my arms as she looked into my eyes, smiling. I smiled too.

“A witch can never be these things,” she said. “A witch is a paranormal creature that lives between the shadows cast by daylight. They traverse the infinities of a heartbeat, they sail in seas of dreams… they manipulate nature.”

I couldn’t understand Mama. It seemed to me that witches did wonderful things.

“Above all else, a witch is evil. Evil for a witch is its own reward,” she finished. I knew it must be true because Mama never lied.

I wondered if Aunty Adesuwa was all these things. I think it was that day my hatred for witches began to take root. I hated how they perverted a thing that would otherwise have been beautiful. I didn’t know why Mama or anyone hadn’t stopped Aunty Adesuwa and I didn’t care to know. I would stop her myself.

I once saw Aunty Adesuwa eavesdropping on my mother and two of her friends. I didn’t know how to signal Mama without her seeing me. My palms became sweaty and my breathing difficult.

“We all know Adesuwa killed her ex-husband’s illegitimate child,” Aunty Bisi, one of Mama’s friends said. She probably thought she was whispering. She wasn’t. Aunty Bisi always complained about my clothing to my mom. She had a big nose. I didn’t like her. As I stood paralyzed by fear, Aunty Adesuwa burst into the meeting. She was all tears and fury.

“I loved that child!” she screamed. Mama and her friends stared open-mouthed at her.

“Am I the cancer that afflicted him?” she asked. “You’re all typical weak women! You judge me for leaving a man who was perpetually unfaithful. You judge me for doing well for myself without his help. You blame me for his misfortunes. You blame me for the death of a child whom I loved regardless of the manner of his conception.”

While she talked I felt it resonating in my bones. My blood seemed to heat up in my veins as if her words scorched my insides. I wondered if Mama and her friends felt this strangeness. They didn’t seem to.

“God will judge all of you” Aunty Adesuwa said finally, walking away. Days later, I still pondered her words.

It was a sunny day, two weeks after Aunty Adesuwa’s tirade. I hid in the bushes by her house. Aunty Bisi had come down with a fever. Mama had sent me to give her and her big nose the medicinal pepper soup. I had subliminally taken a route that went past Aunty Adesuwa’s house when I saw her calling to a teenage boy. He was new in the village. His bicycle seemed worn out. I watched as she offered him a steaming plate of jollof rice and chilled Fanta. I saw a grin split his face. Generally, we were not very hospitable to strangers in our village. Even Mama was downright awful to them. I pondered this as I went to give Aunty Big Nose her pepper soup.

Three weeks later I sneaked out of my house at midnight. Mama was sleeping like a log. She had been helping her only friend other than Aunty Bisi, Aunty Uwa with the burial of her son. He had accidently ridden his bicycle off a cliff the day he came visiting from the neighboring village. I wish I had known him.

I walked to Aunty Adesuwa’s house. I had to see the witch in her element. It still pained me that such a fascinating and wondrous thing as magic was used for evil. I hid in the darkness watching aunty Adesuwa’s house. It was hours before I heard her back door opening. I ran on tip toes to the backyard. I saw Aunty Adesuwa, naked as her name day, striding into the forest. I followed her. It was a long walk. Finally she stepped into a moonlit clearing. As I watched her, I felt a migraine that blurred my sight. In the place where Aunty Adesuwa should have been, there was instead the body of a very large cat with her head still human. Her glowing eyes were looking right at my hidden position in the bushes.

“Idara,” she hissed.

My heart pounded violently. My whole body shook with trepidation. I steadied myself as best as I could and stepped out with Mama’s kitchen knife clutched in my trembling hands.

“I hate you,” I said.

“Why?” she purred innocently.

“‘Cause you’re evil,” I said.

“Are you certain?” she asked.

“Yes,” I said, nodding to myself. Mama had told me witches were evil. She had also said Aunty Adesuwa was a witch. Therefore, Aunty Adesuwa was evil.

“I know you’ve been watching, Idara. Your mother taught you better than to jump to conclusions,” she chided.

“Consider the facts,” she said. It was something Mama always said to me that helped me solve riddles.

“The riddle of witches?” I asked

”The riddle of my witchcraft,” she replied.

I pondered thoughts I had kept in the deep recesses of my mind. I was sure witches were evil because Mama never lied. I was sure Aunty Adesuwa was a witch after seeing her transformation but was I sure Aunty Adesuwa was evil?

Aunty Adesuwa had been kind and sweet to the stranger with the bicycle. She had loved her stepson. She had also shown her strength and independence by leaving her cheating husband and thriving without him. She was also a witch. This was my confusion.

Mama said a witch could never be these things.

“Things not adding up, yes?” she asked, amused by my consternation.

It hit me. Aunty Adesuwa must be a good witch. They actually existed! The realization rekindled a forgotten hope of mine.

“Will you teach me to be a good witch like you?” I asked her.

She purred contentedly. She seemed to have anticipated my response. I suppose I should have been scared. I wasn’t.

“Yes, sweet child. I will teach you to be a witch… just like me,” she said, her tail swinging leisurely behind her.

“Thank you, Aunty,” I said.

She stalked away into the deep foliage gesturing me to follow with her tail.

As I followed, I thought of Mama. Mama never lied but she was human. She could make mistakes. She didn’t know about good witches. I thought about how I would make her proud. I would show her the beauty I had only ever seen in my sea of dreams.","Idara believes that her aunt, Aunty Adesuwa, is a witch.

"Sorry Dan, But It’s No Longer Necessary for a Human to Serve as CEO of This Company",Erik Cofer,"I like you, Dan, I really do. You’ve been the face of this company for many years, overseeing a period of unprecedented net growth. And on a more personal level, you’ve become a dear friend. Heck, our wives attend spin class together twice a week! But unfortunately, friendship only means so much in today’s cutthroat business environment. We—that is, the board and I—have poured over every possible budgetary alteration, and we just can’t conceive of a scenario in which retaining your services makes logistical sense. All the research we’ve conducted behind your back over the last three years suggests that the position of chief executive officer for our multi-billion dollar corporation can be more efficiently performed by a robot.

Effective immediately, you have been relieved of your duties. ROB-X164, seated to your left, will be sworn in as your replacement, with a formal announcement coming this afternoon. While we’re sure this is quite a shock to you right now, we do believe that in time you will accept that this decision is in the best interest of the company.

In your present state of fury, you’re probably wondering, “What makes ROB so special?” The short answer? Everything. We see in ROB a more personable, less error-prone version of you. In our trial runs, he’s performed admirably, demonstrating unparalleled adeptness in strategizing, team-building, allocating, internally storing frozen foods, and launching fastballs in excess of 200 miles per hour. What we’re talking about here is someone who can guide this company to unscaled heights, not to mention its first corporate league softball championship in thirteen years.

ROB has proven himself to be quite the workaholic. It’s a never-ending cycle of productivity with this guy—there’s no taking off for sick days, vacation, or even sleep. There’s also no division of commitment to worry about. No wife, no kids, no embarrassing coke problem. In other words, he’s not burdened with the distractions that plague sentient beings.

He completes tasks at astounding rates—rates you simply can’t compete with. Let’s say he wanted to make love to your wife, which he most certainly does not, as he’s completely devoid of sexual desire, but if he did, he could do so in one quarter of the time it takes you, with half the effort and twice the vigor, eliciting sixty-four times the sexual satisfaction. Factoring in your age, heart rate, and penis size, as well as that new Facebook pic of your wife in compression shorts, ROB arrived at these figures in 3.7 seconds, or, approximately the amount of time it takes you to react to the most vanilla softball pitch imaginable.

If you’re still not convinced of ROB’s utter superiority in every conceivable facet, take a gander at these visual aids:

* Here’s a photo of ROB shaking hands with a prominent shareholder. What a grip!

* Here’s a chart of our projected earnings over the next five years. Notice the sharp upward spike at the chart’s left extreme. That signifies the moment you exit the building, which should occur within the next seven minutes.

* Observe the accompanying GIF: a smiling baby perpetually surfing through waves and waves of cash. We expect the company’s future to closely resemble this image.

* And here’s my favorite. As you can see, it’s an oil painting of ROB embracing me in his arms, lifting me up to the heavens as I triumphantly hoist the corporate softball league championship trophy. You may have noticed that the year engraved on the trophy is outdated. Unfortunately, ROB was still in beta testing last season.

Look, Dan, this is a tough break for you, no doubt. It’s not every day you’re told that your job—for which your entire sense of self-worth hinges upon—can be better managed by a series of interconnected chips and wires concealed beneath a shiny, metallic exterior. In fact, it’s really only one day that this happens, and that day is today, so things can’t get much worse for you going forward. Take comfort in that.

Please be sure to hand your office keys over to HR on your way out. And Dan, lest you suspect that this is some sort of calculated, vindictive act on my part, trust me when I say that this decision has nothing to do with you hitting into a game-ending double play with the bases loaded in the championship game four years ago. Absolutely nothing to do with it at all.","Dan, a long-time employee and friend of the narrator, receives a shocking announcement that he is being replaced as the chief executive officer of the company by a robot named ROB-X164. The board believes that ROB is a more efficient and error-free option for the position. The narrator highlights ROB's abilities, such as strategizing, team-building, and even physically excelling at tasks like launching fastballs. ROB's lack of distractions, like personal relationships and vices, make him an ideal candidate. The narrator presents visual aids to emphasize ROB's superiority, including a photo of ROB with a shareholder, a projected earnings chart, a GIF of a baby surfing through cash, and an oil painting of the narrator and ROB celebrating a corporate softball league championship.

Three Is A Rational Number,Michele Finn Johnson,"Lola’s lost her rational numbers worksheet. She’s got the whole school bus looking for it —when Lola says to do something, it’s like she’s an orchestra conductor and we all just fall in line.

“For God’s sake, people, it was here a second ago. Look a little harder.” Lola’s golden ponytail flops side to side as she paces the aisle. She taps Billy Maguire on the top of his head. “What? You give up already?”

Billy Maguire is the goon of Darby Junior High. He’s easily a head taller than me. I stand up and start toward them; sometimes it’s no fun being Lola’s twin brother. My stomach’s cramping into a raisin, but then I see Maguire rip a sheet out of his spiral notebook.

“I copied mine for you,” he says.

Lola combs over Maguire’s sheet as if she’s grading it or might even reject it. I’m certain her original homework was wrong because she copied off of mine and I’m an algebraic head case. Billy Maguire’s a goon, but Billy Maguire is also the smartest kid in the seventh grade. That’s how I know life isn’t fair. Lola folds Maguire’s offering into her training bra and plops down next to him. I taste this morning’s Cheerios backing up in my throat.

Typical day now. Lola and Maguire are holding hands at the bus stop. It’s 7:45 AM, which makes it even grosser.

My best friend, Seegs, is obsessed with two things—Soldier of Fortune 3 and sex. He points at Lola and Maguire. “How far do you think they’ve gone?”

I think about decking Seegs, but he’s a compulsive nose bleeder. It’s messy, and a weird part of him loves the taste of blood. “That’s my sister, you perv.”

Everything I know about sex I’ve learned from Seegs. He knows practically nothing, but his brother told him stuff and he’s at State College. It’s sick to think about Maguire, his monster lips and hands oozing over my sister. Or maybe more. From the pictures Seegs showed me, the whole thing looks pretty impossible. Like winning a game of Soldier of Fortune 3 against Seegs.

“Yeah,” Seegs says. “But do you think he’s gotten into her bra?”

According to Seegs’ brother, once you get under the girl’s bra, you’re home free. I tried to talk to Lola about it the other night; I asked her if Maguire was behaving himself, which sounded cornball the second I said it. Lola gave me an eye roll, the one she usually gives Mom or Dad when they turn off a PG-13 movie because it’s ‘too risqué.’ I don’t blame her. I sounded like a freaking pilgrim.

The school bus pulls up, and Lola and Maguire are the first to climb in. They prefer the first bench, the one everyone has to pass when they board. Maguire’s cronies slap him a high five as they walk by. Lola glows with her new secrets. 

It’s official—I’m rocking a solid C minus in algebra. Lola is pulling straight A’s, and Mom looks mystified as she posts Lola’s successes on the front of our fridge.

I elbow Lola as she reaches for the milk. “Those are Maguire’s ‘A’s’ you know.”

“Try and keep up,” she says. The way she laughs reminds me of Maguire and his friends, their roars that pierce all of us outcast gamers.

After dinner, we sit at the kitchen table and do our homework like we have since we were six. Lola leaves after half an hour, and when I look at her algebra papers, I can see she’s barely touched them. Why does algebra matter so much—does it really develop real-world problem-solving skills? Lola seems to be solving all sorts of things by herself without even touching this stuff.

Two months later. Lola bolts to the back of the bus, waving at Seegs and me.

“Let me in,” she yells.

She oreos herself in between us and grabs both of our hands. She’s pale, like the time our family went snorkeling and a school of stingrays circled around her. 

Maguire marches back to us.

“I guess she doesn’t want you that bad,” one of his goonies yells.

Lola squeezes my hand hard. “He made me touch it,” she whispers, loud enough that Seegs hears her too.

Seegs and I stand up in the aisle, blocking Maguire from Lola. He opens his mouth and I want to rip into his A+ teeth, deliver an overdue slap.

“I suppose she told you,” Maguire says.

Yes, he towers over me and yes he’s a goon, but the thing is, there’s guilt in the way he says this—I suppose she told you—guilt mixed with something else—fear maybe—and standing here in the aisle of the Darby Junior High school bus, I can almost smell the lack of confidence that Maguire is oozing, like the stingrays probably sensed in Lola. There’s a sudden turn—I’m the stingray now—and I think I can actually solve this equation: boy + girl + twin brother + screw-up = trouble for boy! I’m a rational, problem-solving genius! I’m so wrapped up in the euphoria of solving teenage algebra that I barely notice Seegs push Maguire back up the aisle, or Maguire’s reverse charge and head-butt to Seegs. The bus erupts in roars and cheers. The bus driver is yelling and pulls over to the curb. Seegs’ nose drips blood like he’s been hit by a ghoul engine in Soldier of Fortune, but he is smiling. Blood streaks his teeth. Lola flips through her backpack, looking for tissues or a gym sock, something to sop up Seegs’ blood, but all she can come up with is a crumpled piece of paper. A rational numbers worksheet. I can make out x’s and y’s and squiggles, Lola’s sub-par handwriting. She rips the worksheet into strips and rolls a couple of plugs for Seegs’ nostrils.

Maguire just stands there and stares at all of us for a long while. I wonder if he sees what I do—a girl who drinks Coke through cherry rope licorice, her crooked-scowling brother who has 33 teeth crammed into 32 sockets, a bloody action hero best friend who has overdue C-minus quality math homework stuffed up his nose; a trio that makes no sense; a problem that no one like Maguire will ever be able to solve.","Lola, a persuasive and influential girl, loses her rational numbers worksheet and enlists the help of her school busmates to find it. Billy Maguire, a tall and smart student, offers to share his copy with Lola, who reluctantly accepts. Lola and Maguire start dating, much to the disgust of Lola's twin brother, who is repulsed by the idea of Maguire being intimate with his sister. The brother's best friend, Seegs, constantly brings up the topic of Lola and Maguire's physical relationship, which makes the brother uncomfortable. Meanwhile, Lola excels academically while her brother struggles in algebra. Two months later, Lola reveals to her brother and Seegs that Maguire forced her to touch him inappropriately. In a moment of bravery, the brother confronts Maguire, who responds with guilt and fear. A fight breaks out between Maguire and Seegs, resulting in Seegs getting a bloody nose. Lola, unable to find anything to stop the bleeding, tears up her rational numbers worksheet and uses the strips to plug Seegs' nostrils. Maguire stands there, witnessing the chaotic scene, and perhaps realizing the complexity and uniqueness of the trio he is involved with.","Lola has lost her rational numbers worksheet and enlists the help of her twin brother and the school bus to find it.

The Huntress,Sofia Samatar,"For fear of the huntress the city closed like an eye. Only my window stayed open, because, as a foreigner, I didn’t know better. In the morning, poor children would scrub the stains from the roofs. Now the rain-dark head came down and rested on the dome of the embassy.

The moon shed feathers of light, as if molting. In the morning the eaves would drip with pinkish foam. A stench of fur came in at the window. I went to slam it shut, but instead I stood there, fingers gripping the edge of the frame. I closed my eyes in the searching heat. All over the city people were taking shelter in their cellars and under their beds. Once there were two children and they were the only ones on their block who kept the passion for monsters after they grew up.

The only ones. Why should that be? Our dad used to tell us stories of camel herding. He would scare us by mimicking the sound of a lion. This lion didn’t sound like any lion from movies or games or anything. It had a whining hunger. It was a tenor lion.

Her prowler’s voice, surprisingly high and small. Like a question. All over the city people were covering their heads. The leaves outside my window shrank and smoked. Exiles and insomniacs share this feeling: that each is the only one.

I feel like I’m turning into this fierce person. A taskmaster to myself, like a ballet dancer or a monk. Are monks happy? No, they are not interested in that category of feeling. But I’m supposed to be. I’m an American.

The Huntress left dark patches wherever she passed. She left a streak. In the morning, the hotel staff would find me unconscious, gummed to the floor. The proprietor weeping, for nothing like this had ever happened in his establishment, nothing. Had I not read the instructions on the desk?

The fierceness can be seen around the mouth. I compress my lips when I’m thinking. Our dad was the same way.

In the morning the staff would run me a bath. Now the Huntress bent to my window, but she was not there to feed. She was there as a witness.","The story revolves around the narrator, a foreigner in a city where the residents are fearful of a huntress. The city closes up, but the narrator's window remains open due to their ignorance. The huntress, depicted with a rain-dark head, rests on the dome of the embassy.

A stench of fur enters the narrator's window, causing them to consider closing it. However, they find themselves standing there, gripping the window frame, and closing their eyes. The city's residents take shelter, but the narrator remembers how they and their sibling were the only ones who maintained a passion for monsters after growing up.

The narrator recalls their father telling them stories of camel herding, sometimes mimicking the sound of a lion. The lion's sound was unique, with a whining hunger, like a tenor lion. The huntress's voice is described as surprisingly high and small, like a question. The city's residents cover their heads, and the leaves outside the narrator's window shrink and smoke.

The narrator reflects on their transformation into a fierce person, comparing themselves to a taskmaster, a ballet dancer, or a monk. They wonder if monks are happy, but acknowledge that they, as an American, are supposed to be interested in happiness.

The story reveals that the narrator often compresses their lips when deep in thought, a trait they inherited from their father. In the morning, the hotel staff finds the narrator unconscious and stuck to the floor. The proprietor is distraught, as such an incident has never occurred in his establishment before.

The narrator describes the fierceness they feel, particularly around their mouth. They mention how the staff will run them a bath in the morning.

My Dead,Peter Orner,"Her name was Beth. We didn’t know each other. We took her car and headed to Missouri from Chicago. I remember that by the time we’d gone a few miles south on the Stevenson we’d already run out of things to say. But, for some reason, we both decided, without spelling it out, not to push it. Nothing was going to come of this, of us, we had hours to go, and it was all right just to let the silence be and listen to the radio. We were on our way to a séance she’d heard about from an old high-school friend. She’d grown up in a small town southwest of St. Louis, and the séance was being held nearby, at an abandoned air-force base.

We’d met a couple of nights before. Beth had come into the restaurant near the Loop where I waited tables, and had written her number on a napkin. “Call me,” she’d ordered. A couple of nights later, over drinks, she told me that she wasn’t the kind of person who ordered people to call her. Something about my face had said that I needed to be told what to do. That was also when she mentioned that this séance was happening at 2:00 A.M. near St. Louis. If we left right away, she said, we could probably make it. The fact that we both had to be at work the next day made it all the more spontaneous and awesome. We headed out into the night exalted, until, like I said, our conversation dried up completely. It was as if the intrepid adventure were already over and now we just had a shitlong ride ahead of us, which we did.

When I woke up, we were already past St. Louis and Beth had turned off onto a narrow two-lane highway that cut through a forest. We drove another hour and a half before we reached the base. As per her friend’s instructions, we ditched the car beneath a stand of trees. Beth didn’t need any help climbing the fence. She practically leapt over it, and I had to sprint to catch up with her as she strode along the ghost streets, past rows of empty barracks.

“What’s the hurry?” I said. “Everybody’s already dead.” No answer. When we got to Hangar 32, the séance had already begun. About a dozen people were standing in a circle holding hands. At the center of the circle was a flower pot. Two people unclasped their hands to allow Beth and me to join. A bearded guy in a black watch cap was mumbling with authority. I admit that at first I found the whole thing mesmerizing. Coming upon this group in the darkness of that enormous hangar, the man chanting, the single flame flowing shadows onto the corrugated walls. There was something weirdly sacred about it all, and I thought, Right, if you want to commune with the dead, of course what you have to do is drive across the night to Missouri.

But, after half an hour, forty-five minutes, I began to understand just how fucking cold I was. It was mid-March and I hadn’t dressed for it. You want to dress lightly on a first date to demonstrate how free and easy-going you are. The dude was still mumbling, and I waited for something, anything, to happen, while softly stamping my feet on the crumbling pavement to warm them up. I was about to whisper to Beth, whose hand I was holding, “Yo, why don’t we blow this popsicle stand and get some fucking breakfast?,” when somebody new began shouting. “Marina? Is that you, Marina?” Then other people were speaking, too. “Larry, tell your sister I’m onto her games.” “How many years did you think you could hide in plain sight, Ramon?” Even Beth got into it: “You never loved me, not a day, not an hour, not a second of a single minute—”

Everybody was speaking at once, and I had trouble discerning individual words in the chaos of voices. And it was ridiculous, it was beyond ridiculous, but it also wasn’t ridiculous. Shouts in the dark. Maybe that’s the best we can do to reach beyond ourselves. I tried to join in, too, but I could sense none of my dead, and I couldn’t, for the life of me, think of anything to just spout out. So I bought it, but at the same time, by that point, I was just trying to live through it, I was so cold. Then the candle went out and our leader broke ranks and swooped down to relight it, but his lighter jammed. We all stopped speaking and began patting down our pockets for a lighter or matches. But our leader shouted at us, “No! Don’t break the membrane! Re-bond!”

We never quite got back on track after that. The collective spirit or belief or whatever it was escaped from us, and, though our leader mumbled for another half an hour, only a few people spoke up. The guy next to me, a guy I’d been holding hands with for almost two hours without getting a look at his face, actually made a joke. At least, I thought it was a joke. He said something about the temperature of coffee in hell. I laughed out loud. No one else did. That pretty much ended it. Before we left, Beth went up to the leader and gave him a kiss on the lips that wasn’t a friend’s kiss, not by a long stretch. In the car, I asked her who she’d reached. She said she didn’t want to talk about it.

“So you and the dude—”

“That was nothing. O.K.?”

We settled back into the silence of the drive. No radio now, just the drone of the engine, which you don’t hear unless you listen for it, and then it’s there all the time. It was getting toward dawn, and the dark was giving way to gray. I’ve always loved that early-morning gloom. I was about to say as much, to try to chip away at the silence, when I noticed that the car had begun to drift into the oncoming lane. Beth had fallen asleep. I don’t know why but, instead of grabbing the wheel, I seized her shoulder. She woke up but didn’t seem to realize what was happening and immediately stomped on the brakes. We jolted forward, skidded, and stopped. Headlights were approaching out of the gray. I had time for only one thing. I opened my door, got out, ran off the road into the trees, and waited for the headlights to slam into Beth.

They didn’t. The other driver saw her in time and fishtailed around her and stopped. For a few moments, everything was still. Then I heard the birds in the trees. I walked back out to the road. The guy rolled down the window of his truck. He looked at Beth in her car; he looked at me. Then he drove away, as if some lovers’ spat weren’t worth anything he might have mustered up to say. My door was still open. Beth was calm, motionless, her hands still gripping the wheel.

When something happens, for better or for worse it’s happened. It has a before. It has an after. Maybe you can talk about it. Maybe you can’t. But what about something that almost happens? What almost happens repeats itself. I’ve come to believe this as a kind of personal gospel. We’re stopped in the opposite lane. I see lights emerge out of the gray. I open my door and run. I leave her in the car to die. Every time.","Beth and the narrator embark on a spontaneous road trip to attend a séance in Missouri. As they drive in silence, they arrive at an abandoned air-force base where the séance is being held. The group gathers in a circle, holding hands, and begins speaking to the spirits. However, the atmosphere turns chaotic, and the narrator feels disconnected from the experience. Eventually, the candle goes out, and the leader instructs them not to break the connection. The séance loses its momentum, and Beth kisses the leader before they leave.

On the drive back, Beth falls asleep, and the car drifts into the oncoming lane. The narrator, instead of grabbing the wheel, exits the car and waits for an oncoming vehicle to collide with Beth.

The Wife on Ambien,Ed Park,"The wife on Ambien knows the score. I mean this literally. Rangers, 4–3 in overtime. Devils fall to the Flames, 3–1. Knicks lose again at home. In the morning, I open the paper and none of this checks out.

The wife on Ambien calls me Bob, calls me Mom, calls me Mr. Bluepants.

The wife on Ambien makes false starts. In one week, she has sketched a music hall (she is not an architect), designed a drone (she is not an engineer), written two scenes of a play called “Haunted Masquerade” (her M.F.A. is in sculpture). The handwriting is a bear, but I piece together a plot: society lady leads double life in the London of Jack the Ripper. In the morning, the wife on Ambien denies authorship, though at lunch I hear the first line of the soliloquy leave her lips.

The wife on Ambien cooks eggs. I take pains to hide the ingredients and the hardware. Still, she conjures omelettes from a secret stash of eggs, with a pan I somehow miss. She singes her robe. I gain five pounds in a month.

The wife on Ambien gets fresh. She moves on top of me like it’s spin class. That was nice, I say afterward. Really nice. It reminds me of our wedding night. Paris! My God! We were so young! Do you remember how the stars, I say, then stop, because she’s already snoring.

The wife on Ambien tries to order Ambien on Amazon.

The wife on Ambien makes up names of golfers.

The wife on Ambien keeps me guessing. You don’t want to know what I did in Tucson, she says, patting me on the head, like a child. I’d better not say what went down in West Hartford. Tell me, I say. She looks around for some eggs.

The wife on Ambien shifts her legs. To the left, to the right, to the left, to the right. She bends and extends. What are you doing? I whisper in her ear. Skiing, she says. Skiing in the Canadian Rockies with Mr. Bluepants.

The wife on Ambien recites the poetry of T. S. Eliot, sings the music of the Jesus and Mary Chain, calculates how much we need to save to retire. Her figures vary. The wife on Ambien also tells me it doesn’t matter, that the sun will swallow the Earth exactly eight billion years, or thirteen weeks, or twenty-four hours from now.

The wife on Ambien orders Uber after Uber. The cars stream toward us like a series of sharks. It’s 4 A.M. Drivers from many countries gather on the corner, fling curses at our window, break out the booze, arrange marriages among their offspring.

The wife on Ambien hacks into my Facebook account and leaves slurs on the pages of my enemies. Get a life, you’re a joke. She joins political causes directly opposed to her own. I spend an hour every morning cleaning up the digital trail.

The wife on Ambien shouts, Atlantis! Just that. Atlantis!

The wife on Ambien drinks an entire quart of milk. She washes out the slim jug and stands it up in the recycling bin like a soldier.

The wife on Ambien forgets about our children, Danica, eleven, and Morris, five. We named them after a race-car driver and a cat. It was her idea. She had it on Ambien. I get home from work after nine and see the kids attacking each other with belts while she sleeps, all the cushions and pillows piled in the center of the living room. Don’t wreck our fort, Daddy, Morris says. That’s more like a tower, I say. Then don’t wreck our tower, Danica says. What about your homework? I ask my daughter. Homework’s for losers, she says. Losers like you, Morris says. Honey, I call, but the wife on Ambien is sawing logs.

The wife on Ambien takes her vitamins, organizes the spice rack. She alphabetizes the shelves in the hallway and polishes my shoes. She wanders a while, adjusting picture frames that are out of true. Everything looks cleaner in the morning. But other nights she’s knocking tchotchkes off tables, surrounding the wastebasket with coffee grounds in ritual fashion.

The wife on Ambien—how can I describe her? The way she tilts her head reminds me of pictures of her grandmother as a youth. The way she does a Bronx cheer reminds me of my first boss, who was in the Merchant Marine.

The wife on Ambien scrolls through her phone, swipes with her eyes shut. I can’t wrench it from her iron grip. In the morning, she asks, Did you change the time zone to Dubai?

I sense a light. It’s 3:15 A.M., and the wife on Ambien is playing online poker. Around the virtual table are Joker17, AceInHole, and Mr_Bluepants. I would force her to stop, but she’s winning by a lot. Someone has to bring home the bacon while my startup starts up. That’s how I figure it. I’m seeking funding for a virtual-reality venture that will let you live in the home you grew up in.

The wife on Ambien can list the Presidents in order. The wife in real life can’t.

The wife on Ambien tries her hand at painting. The tubes are open, the brushes stand in a coffee can of gray water, there’s a becoming beige smudge on her brow, but where are the canvasses, whither the tableaux? Many years later, when we move out of the city, I find her art under a box of books in a basement storage locker. These are all pictures of toast, I say.

The wife on Ambien solves Danica’s Rubik’s Cube.

The wife on Ambien insists she doesn’t snore. One night, I set up my phone to record her, balancing it on an eyeglasses case between our pillows, wondering if that’s legal.

The Visitor,Lydia Davis,"Sometime in the early summer, a stranger will come and take up residence in our house.  Although we have not met him, we know he will be bald, incontinent, speechless, and nearly completely unable to help himself.  We don’t know exactly how long he will stay, relying entirely on us for food, clothing, and shelter.

Our situation reminds me that a leathery-skinned old Indian gentleman once spent several months with my sister in London.  At first he slept in a tent in her back yard. Then he moved into the house.  Here he made it his project to rearrange the many books in the house, which were in no particular order.  He decided upon categories—mystery, history, fiction—and surrounded himself with clouds of smoke from his cigarettes as he worked.  He explained his system in correct but halting English to anyone who came into the room.  Several years later he died suddenly and painfully in a London hospital.  For religious reasons, he had refused all treatment.

This Indian visitor of my sister’s also reminds me of another old man—the very old father of a friend of mine.  He had once been a professor of economics.  He was old and deaf even when my friend was a child.  Later he could not contain his urine, laughed wildly and soundlessly during his daughter’s wedding, and when asked to say a few words rose trembling and spoke about Communism.  This man is now in a nursing home.  My friend says he is smaller every year.

Like my friend’s father, our visitor will have to be bathed by us, and will not use the toilet.  We have appointed a small, sunny room for him next to ours, where we will be able to hear him if he needs help during the night.  Some day, he may repay us for all the trouble we will go to, but we don’t really expect it.  Although we have not yet met him, he is one of the few people in the world for whom we would willingly sacrifice almost anything.","In this story, the narrator reflects on the upcoming arrival of a stranger who will be staying in their house. The stranger is described as being bald, incontinent, speechless, and completely reliant on others for basic needs. The narrator draws parallels to past experiences with similar individuals, such as an old Indian gentleman who stayed with their sister in London. This man had a passion for organizing books and enjoyed explaining his system to anyone who entered the room. However, he died in a hospital after refusing treatment due to religious reasons. Another parallel is drawn to the very old father of a friend, who was once a professor of economics but now resides in a nursing home and has deteriorated both physically and mentally. 

The narrator anticipates that their visitor will require constant care, including bathing and assistance with toileting. They have prepared a small room next to theirs to ensure they can promptly attend to the visitor's needs during the night. Despite the potential challenges and sacrifices involved in caring for the stranger, the narrator expresses a willingness to help, as this person is one of the few in the world for whom they would willingly make such sacrifices.","In this story, the narrator anticipates the arrival of a stranger who will come to live in their house. The stranger is described as bald, incontinent, speechless, and completely dependent on the narrator and their household for all their needs. The length of the stranger's stay is unknown, but the narrator recognizes that they will have to provide food, clothing, and shelter for the stranger.

The narrator finds themselves reminiscing about a previous experience with an old Indian man who had stayed with their sister in London. The Indian man had initially slept in a tent in the backyard but eventually moved into the house. During his stay, he took it upon himself to organize the books in the house, creating categories and filling the room with smoke from his cigarettes. The Indian man died years later in a London hospital after refusing treatment due to religious reasons.

The narrator also recalls an old man who was the father of a friend. This man had been a professor of economics but had become old and deaf over time. He experienced various ailments, including incontinence and erratic behavior, such as laughing silently and uncontrollably during his daughter's wedding. Eventually, the man was placed in a nursing home, and the narrator's friend notes that he continues to deteriorate.

Drawing parallels to these previous experiences, the narrator acknowledges that their upcoming visitor will require similar care and attention. They have prepared a small, sunny room next to theirs so that they can hear the stranger if he needs assistance during the night. Despite not having met the stranger yet, the narrator expresses a willingness to sacrifice almost anything for him, implying a deep sense of compassion and empathy.

It highlights the human capacity for compassion and the willingness to make sacrifices for those in need, even without any expectation of receiving anything in return.",s43
Sticks,George Saunders,"Every year Thanksgiving night we flocked out behind Dad as he dragged the Santa suit to the road and draped it over a kind of crucifix he'd built out of metal pole in the yard. Super Bowl week the pole was dressed in a jersey and Rod's helmet and Rod had to clear it with Dad if he wanted to take the helmet off. On the Fourth of July the pole was Uncle Sam, on Veteran’s Day a soldier,  on Halloween a ghost. The pole was Dad's only concession to glee. We were allowed a single Crayola from the box at a time. One Christmas Eve he shrieked at Kimmie for wasting an apple slice. He hovered over us as we poured ketchup saying: good enough good enough good enough. Birthday parties consisted of cupcakes, no ice cream. The first time I brought a date over she said: what's with your dad and that pole? and I sat there blinking.

We left home, married,  had children of our own, found the seeds of meanness blooming also within us. Dad began dressing the pole with more complexity and less discernible logic. He draped some kind of fur over it on Groundhog Day and lugged out a floodlight to ensure a shadow. When an earthquake struck Chile he lay the pole on its side and spray painted a rift in the earth. Mom died and he dressed the pole as Death and hung from the crossbar photos of Mom as a baby. We'd stop by and find odd talismans from his youth arranged around the base: army medals, theater tickets, old sweatshirts, tubes of Mom's makeup. One autumn he painted the pole bright yellow. He covered it with cotton swabs that winter for warmth and provided offspring by hammering in six crossed sticks around the yard. He ran lengths of string between the pole and the sticks, and taped to the string letters of apology, admissions of error, pleas for understanding, all written in a frantic hand on index cards. He painted a sign saying LOVE and hung it from the pole and another that said FORGIVE? and then he died in the hall with the radio on and we sold the house to a young couple who yanked out the pole and the sticks and left them by the road on garbage day.","The story revolves around a peculiar family tradition that centers around a pole in the yard. Every year, the father dresses up the pole to represent various holidays and occasions. It starts with the Santa suit on Thanksgiving, followed by a football jersey and helmet for the Super Bowl, Uncle Sam for the Fourth of July, a soldier for Veteran’s Day, and a ghost for Halloween.

The father's strict and joyless demeanor is reflected in other aspects of their lives. The children are only allowed one crayon at a time, they are scolded for wasting food, and their birthday parties consist of cupcakes without ice cream. As the children grow up, they realize that they have inherited some of their father's meanness.

Over time, the father becomes more elaborate in dressing up the pole, often without any discernible reason. He drapes fur over it for Groundhog Day, creates an earthquake scene with spray paint, and even dresses it as Death when their mother passes away. He surrounds the pole with sentimental objects from his past and paints it bright yellow one autumn.

In a desperate attempt for forgiveness and understanding, the father attaches letters of apology and admissions of error to strings connecting the pole and sticks around the yard. He also hangs signs asking for love and forgiveness. However, he eventually dies alone in the hallway with the radio on.

After his death, the family sells the house to a young couple who removes the pole and sticks, leaving them by the road for garbage collection. The story ends with a sense of loss and the remnants of the father's strange and complex tradition being discarded.","The story revolves around the father's strange obsession with a pole in their yard that he dresses up for various occasions. The family never really understood the significance of the pole and its changing outfits, but they accepted it as a part of their lives. However, as time goes on, the father's behavior becomes more erratic and his obsession with the pole intensifies.

The family members grow up and start families of their own, but they also find themselves carrying on the seeds of meanness that they observed in their father. Meanwhile, the father continues to dress the pole with increasing complexity and without any discernible logic.

After their mother's death, the father dresses the pole as Death and hangs pictures of her as a baby from it. He also starts collecting talismans from his youth and arranges them around the base of the pole. As his behavior becomes more desperate, he paints the pole bright yellow and covers it with cotton swabs for warmth during winter.

In a final act of desperation, the father hammers six crossed sticks around the yard, connects them with string, and tapes written apologies, admissions of error, and pleas for understanding to the string. He also hangs signs saying ""LOVE"" and ""FORGIVE?"" from the pole. Tragically, the father dies in the hallway with the radio on.

After the father's death, the family sells the house to a young couple who remove the pole and the sticks and leave them by the road on garbage day. This ending serves as a metaphor for the family finally letting go of their father's strange and obsessive behavior.",s44
This Is How You Fail To Ghost Him,Victoria McCurdy,"Swipe right. Swipe right.

Tinder. Bumble. Be unable to remember which, but this younger, generically handsome boy whose face reminds you of a Playmobil figure has driven from the suburbs tonight to meet you.

Stand about awkwardly untill you are seated at a table in the loudest section of the bar. Order wine. Order apps. Try to engage him in conversation. Lean across the table in order to hear over the sound system blaring an Adele song about love, love in the dark.

Cup your palm to your ear to indicate you are having trouble.

Watch as his attention flashes up from your breasts to your eyes before he half yells the word “Pizza.”

Recognize his cologne as you lean in closer, 1 Million by Paco Rabanne, the scent of the moment for the young, professional and sexually hopeful.

Repeat the word pizza as a question back to him.

Nod as he says, I just really really love pizza, because that is the required response. Then randomly think how you are like a pebble and that this boy is like a pebble, that you are like two random pebbles thrown together by the fist of the internet.

Say you like pizza too. Say yes to thin crust. Yes to deep dish. Yes to cheese, especially cheese. Nod enthusiastically at his suggestion of the Hawaiian, though truth be told, you cannot imagine the combination of pineapple and Spam. And also because you are dating-weary, fail to notice the good things about him—that he is not constantly checking his phone, not checking out other women, that he is clean-shaven, attentive, and not outwardly crazy.

Find yourself unable to listen to his all-about-me speech, the required get-to-know-you section of every first internet date. Weight at birth, post college year at Teach for America, current job as systems analyst for blah blah corporation blah blah blah, current obsessions—unicycles and organic brew pubs. Blame your inattentiveness on the fact that you know how all this usually goes. He will like you but you will feel a diffuse revulsion at the touch of his lips. He will like you, but confess he and his girlfriend are looking for a third. You will like him and he will not call. You will like him and then realize he is a fuk boi, which means what it means. You will not like him but he will propose by text and then lapse into vulgarity when you ghost him in response.

When he turns the conversation toward you, find yourself lying. Tell him you were born at nine thousand feet on a mountain in Tasmania. Tell him that your intermittent vertigo ended your career as a flight attendant. Tell him you are the proud owner of four tarantulas. Stutter when he tells you that he, too, has a tarantula. Wonder what he means when he asks if you raise your own crickets. Elaborate further by saying you inherited the tarantulas from your old boyfriend. That your old boyfriend is a Sumo wrestler. Yes, from Japan. No, they don’t call it a diaper. Tell him you now work as an egg sorter for Locally Laid. Yes, it is local. Realize that your saying these things is a direct reflection of your futile worldview.

Do not under any circumstance admit the following : that you were raised on Beauty and the Beast, that you have kissed many a rough exterior searching for the glimpse of a prince, that your timetable for love is a red rose, slowly losing petals under glass.

Fail to notice that he is staring at you in wonder with a tiny smile, as if you are a beautiful but slightly crazy sea creature he has discovered in a hidden pool.

Pretend you are lying in a bed that happens to be in a Greek taverna, the twinkling lights replacing stars. Turn the white noise to the sound of electronic waves. Feel the pounding of your roommate’s headboard against your shared wall and a deep-throated male laughter. Think how you used to have a boyfriend who was not a Sumo wrestler. Wonder how OKCupid and then Tinder and then Bumble have failed you. And as it will surely come to nothing, how you never want to communicate with the Playmobil boy again.

At the second sound of bells, reach toward your cluttered nightstand, pushing aside books and cough drop wrappers until you find your phone. Worry it will be him. Worry it won’t be him. Worry it will be just another dick pic. Do not expect the text you read.

Unnecessary Things,Tatyana Tolstaya,"This Teddy bear once had amber eyes made from special glass—each one had a pupil and an iris. The bear itself was gray and stiff, with wiry fur. I adored him.

Then a lifetime went by. I bought my own apartment in St. Petersburg and was walking around the parental abode collecting my clothes and books while begging my mother for various knickknacks and for old fabrics stored in even older suitcases. No one had any need for this stuff—not my mother and certainly not me—but I like unnecessary things: all the pragmatic, commercial, and manipulative meaning has disappeared from them, any usefulness has evaporated, leaving only their naked souls, their true selves, all that was heretofore hidden by the hustle and bustle of passing days.

While digging in the cupboard under the stairs, surrounded by grimy burlap and old ski poles that none of us could bring ourselves to throw away, groping in the dark in the space between the wall and the storage chest, I found the bear or, to be more precise, his remains: a furry wooden frame with a single front paw, a plastic button for one eye and bits of hanging black thread for the other.

I grabbed him, holding him tight, clutching his dusty, bristly torso, and closing my eyes to keep the unexpected stream of tears from raining down on him. I just stood there, in the stifling and cramped semi-darkness, listening to the frenzied beating of my heart. Or perhaps it was the bear’s heart—who’s to know?

What was it like? Maybe something like this: say you have babies, they grow up and turn forty, and you get used to this fact and live with it, and then you rummage in the closet and here he is, your first baby, the way he used to be—eighteen months old, not able to talk yet, sweet-smelling like oatmeal and applesauce, his face puffy from crying, lost but found, waiting for you all these decades behind the storage chest in the closet, unable to call for you—and now you are finally reunited.

I took him with me to my new apartment. Everything there was insultingly new—that is, unfamiliar and alien. The place was full of items bought at antique and secondhand shops, items that had previously belonged to other people and had not yet acclimated to their new habitat. I did my best to soften the strangeness of these foreign chests of drawers and sideboards with my mother’s knickknacks and fabrics. I placed the bear on my bed, not knowing what else to do with him.

That night, I slept with my arm around him; he weakly returned the hug with his solitary paw. It was a white summer night, a kind of gauze with dusky twilight, no slumber, but a yearning for it. The bear smelled of dust, dust and old age, infirmity, decades, millennia. Opening my eyes in the underwater dimness of this alabaster midnight, I could see the black thread hanging from his miserable little eye socket. I stroked his wooden head; it was covered with scars. I touched his ears.

No, I thought, this cannot continue. There is a short story by William Faulkner called “A Rose for Emily.” It’s about a woman who poisons her lover to prevent him from leaving her, and who subsequently locks herself in her house and refuses to leave it for the forty years until her death. After her funeral, a rotted corpse in a rotted nightshirt is found lying on his side in a bed, as if embracing someone, and next to him, on a pillow with the indentation of a head, there is a single long strand of iron-gray hair.

In the morning, I left for Moscow. And when I came back, a month later, the bear was gone. He wasn’t on the bed, or under it; he wasn’t in any of the closets, or in the crawlspace. He was nowhere to be found. Nowhere.","The narrator of the story discovers a beloved teddy bear from their childhood while collecting items from their parents' house. The bear is in a dilapidated state, with only a wooden frame, one plastic eye, and bits of hanging thread. Overwhelmed with emotion, the narrator takes the bear to their new apartment in St. Petersburg.

In their unfamiliar surroundings, filled with new and foreign items, the narrator places the bear on their bed. That night, they sleep with their arm around the bear, feeling its weak response. The atmosphere is described as a white summer night, filled with a longing for sleep. The bear emits a scent of dust, old age, and infirmity.

The narrator realizes that they cannot continue this attachment to the bear, drawing a parallel to the story ""A Rose for Emily"" by William Faulkner, where a woman poisons her lover to prevent him from leaving and locks herself in her house until her death. The narrator decides to leave for Moscow, and upon returning a month later, discovers that the bear has disappeared. It is nowhere to be found in the apartment.

The story explores the emotional connection between the narrator and the teddy bear, symbolizing their attachment to the past and the transient nature of memories. The disappearance of the bear suggests the ephemeral nature of nostalgia and the inevitability of change.","The story begins with the narrator finding a Teddy bear with special glass eyes in an old cupboard under the stairs of their parental home. The bear, gray and stiff with wiry fur, holds sentimental value to the narrator. The discovery of the bear brings up memories and emotions, and the narrator becomes overwhelmed with tears. They describe the bear as if it were a long-lost loved one, evoking the feeling of being reunited with someone precious.

The narrator takes the bear with them to their new apartment in St. Petersburg, which is filled with unfamiliar and new items. They place the bear on their bed, unsure of where else to put it. That night, the narrator sleeps with their arm around the bear, feeling a sense of comfort and nostalgia. The bear's presence brings a mixture of emotions, representing the passage of time and the weight of memories.

However, the next morning when the narrator returns from a trip to Moscow, the bear has disappeared. It cannot be found anywhere in the apartment. The story ends with the bear's absence, leaving a sense of loss and longing.",s46
War of the Clowns,Mia Couto,"One time two clowns set themselves to arguing. The people
would stop, amused, to watch them.
— What’s that? they asked.
— Why, it’s only two clowns arguing.
Who could take them seriously? Ridiculous, the two comedians rep-
arteed. The arguments were common nonsense, the theme was a ninnery.
And an entire day passed.
The following morning, the two remained, obnoxious and outdoing
each other. It seemed as though, between them, even yucca soured. In the
street, meanwhile, those present were exhilarated with the masquerade.
The buffoons began worsening their insults with fine-edged and fine-
tuned barbs. Believing it to be a show, the passersby left coins along the
roadside.
On the third day, however, the clowns arrived at acts of force. Their
blows became a disarray, their counterkicks zinged more across air than
across bodies. The children rollicked, imitating each jester’s blows. And
they laughed at the two fools, their bodies tripping upon their own selves.
And the boys wanted to repay the delightful goodness of the clowns.
— Dad, give me some coins to leave on the sidewalk.
On the fourth day, the jabs and blows grew worse. Beneath their
makeup, the faces of the clowns began to bleed. Some kids became
scared. Was that true blood?
— It’s not serious, don’t fret, their parents soothed them.
In failures of trajectory, some were struck by directionless wallops. But
it was light fare, only serving to add to the laughs. More and more people
joined the gallery.
— What’s going on?
Nothing. A friendly unsettling of accounts. It’s not worth separating
them. They’ll tire out, it’s nothing more than a bit of clowning around.
On the fifth day, however, one of the clowns armed himself with a
stick. Advancing on his adversary, he discharged a blow that tore off his
wig. The other, furious, equipped himself with a symmetrical beating
bat and responded with the same dismeasure. The wooden rods whistled
through the air in somersaults and deliriums. One of the spectators, un-
expectedly, was struck. The man fell, deadspread.
A certain confusion arose, the souls divided. Little by little, two battle-
fields began to form. Various groups traded drubbings. Still more were
felled.
It entered a second week and the surrounding neighborhoods heard
it said that a dizzied pandemonium had set in around the two clowns.
And the thing embroiled the entire plaza. And the neighbors found it
funny. Some went to the plaza to verify the reports. They returned with
contradicting and inflamed versions of their own. The neighborhood
continued to divide itself, in opposing opinions. Conflicts began in some
neighborhoods.
On the twentieth day, shots began to be heard. No one knew exactly
where they came from. Could have been from any point in the city.
Full of terror, the inhabitants armed themselves. The tiniest movement
seemed suspect. The shots spread. Dead bodies began to accumulate in
the streets. Terror reigned over the whole city. Soon, massacres began.
At the beginning of the month, all the city’s inhabitants had died. All
except the two clowns. That morning, the comics sat, each one in his
corner, and ridded themselves of their ridiculous dress. They looked at
each other, worn out. Later, they rose to their feet and embraced, laugh-
ing at the flags dispersed. Arm in arm, they gathered the coins from the
roadsides.Together they crossed the city destroyed, careful not to tread on
the cadavers. And they went in search of another city.","In this story, two clowns engage in a playful argument, entertaining the people who watch them. The arguments are nonsensical and the theme is foolishness. As the days pass, the clowns become more obnoxious and their insults sharper. The audience finds it amusing and leaves coins for them. However, on the third day, their playful acts turn into acts of force, with blows and kicks becoming more intense. Children imitate their actions and laugh at their clumsy movements. The children even ask their parents for coins to leave for the clowns. On the fourth day, the clowns' faces start bleeding under their makeup, scaring some of the children. But the parents reassure them that it's not serious. The blows become more erratic, hitting bystanders by accident, but everyone continues to laugh. As more people gather to watch the spectacle, confusion arises about what is happening. On the fifth day, one of the clowns strikes the other with a stick, escalating the violence. The other clown retaliates with a beating bat, and a spectator is unintentionally killed. Chaos ensues, with conflicts breaking out among different groups. The city becomes divided, and violence spreads beyond the plaza. Shots are heard, terrorizing the inhabitants. Massacres occur, and eventually, the entire city's population is killed, except for the two clowns. The clowns, exhausted from the destruction they caused, remove their costumes and look at each other. They laugh at the flags scattered around and then embrace. They collect the coins left on the roadside and walk through the destroyed city, being careful not to step on the corpses. Together, they set off in search of another city.","In this story, two clowns engage in a seemingly harmless argument that quickly escalates into a destructive and deadly conflict. Initially, the people find amusement in watching the clowns argue, dismissing it as a mere spectacle. However, as the clowns continue their dispute, the insults intensify, and their physical blows become more violent. Despite the increasing aggression, the onlookers still find amusement and even contribute coins to the clowns as a form of entertainment. 

As the days pass, the clowns' fight becomes more brutal, leading to injuries and causing children to become frightened. The violence continues to escalate until one of the clowns wields a stick, resulting in the accidental death of a spectator. Chaos ensues as groups form, taking sides in the conflict, and engaging in battles of their own. The neighborhood becomes divided, with conflicting reports and opinions causing further strife. 

The situation worsens as the violence spreads beyond the plaza, with shots being fired throughout the city. In fear, the inhabitants arm themselves, and the city descends into a state of terror and massacres. Eventually, all the inhabitants perish, except for the two clowns. They shed their clown attire and, realizing the devastation their argument caused, embrace each other, laughing at the destruction they have wrought. They collect the coins left behind and set out to find another city, being mindful not to step on the corpses littering their path.

The story highlights the absurdity of conflict and how a seemingly trivial disagreement can escalate into a destructive force. The clowns, initially meant to bring joy and laughter, become the catalysts for the city's downfall, leaving behind a trail of destruction and death. Their actions serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked aggression and the consequences it can have on society.",s47
Angels and Blueberries,Tara Campbell,"“Why is the sky blue?” you ask.

Well, it all depends on who’s answering. 

If you ask a grown-up, you’ll probably get an answer about light, and how it bounces off air particles, and how certain wavelengths (i.e. colors) get absorbed, and certain colors (i.e. wavelengths) get kicked back out, and those certain colors/wavelengths (i.e. blue) are the ones that you and I can see. 

If you ask a scientist, you’ll likely get an even more confusing but way more convincing version of that answer.

But if you ask a writer, you’ll get a different answer every time.

One answer, for example, lies with the special properties of blue fingerpaint.  Whenever children use blue paint, tiny particles of it dissolve from their hands into the air and color it blue.  Over time the pigment fades, but as long as there is fingerpainting, there will always be blue sky.

Another answer is related to the blue-eyed creatures at the North and South Poles.  They are always looking up into the sky, and the blue of their eyes reflects back for the whole world to see.  You’ve probably never heard of these polar creatures because they know how to hide from satellites and explorers.  The reflection of their eyes is all we’ll ever see of them.

But the answer I think is true right now concerns angels and blueberries. 

You see, blueberries are the angels’ favorite food.  There’s nothing they like more; and berries are healthy, so it’s a happy coincidence.  The only problem is, angels are sloppy eaters, and they eat pretty much all day. Of course they do other things like play the harp and sing and keep little babies from getting into the bleach under the sink. But they still have lots of time to munch on blueberries—they live forever, after all—so little bits of blueberry wind up all over the sky.

Even worse, some angels don’t like the blueberry skins, so they peel each berry before eating it and toss the skins to the side.  This doesn’t make them blatant litterers, mind you—they know they’ll get around to picking up the skins, just not at that very moment.

So as the day goes on, the angels eat more and more berries; and as the sun goes down, its light reflects through the berry pulp and juice, creating wonderful reds and oranges and yellows.  And still the angels eat, and the sky grows darker and darker with blue skins and bits of berry.  The angels keep on munching until, with the exception of little gaps for the moon and stars, no light can get to the Earth at all.  In fact, there’s not even enough room for the moon most of the time, which is why you only see the whole thing once a month.

In the middle of the night God finally has enough, and she tells the angels they have to start cleaning up their mess.  Of course they start right away, but it’s a big mess and it takes a while.  And as they clean, you can see a little bits of light start to penetrate the layer of blueberry waste.  Dawn begins as they wipe and scrub, and daylight breaks when they finally clear away enough blueberries for the sun to shine on the Earth again. 

The one problem is that blueberry skins stain, and the angels can’t scrub the traces away completely.  Some days they do better, and the sky is light blue.  But on very sunny days you can see the full extent of the staining and the sky is a rich, dark blue.  But God isn’t that concerned about the stains.  She actually thinks they’re pretty, and the renters down on the surface don’t mind, and she’s not planning on moving anytime soon, so it’s not like she has to worry about resale value.  What matters to her is that the angels did their best.

Now, you may wonder what would happen if the angels ever got tired of blueberries.  What would happen if they switched to raspberries?  Would the sky eventually wind up purple?  If they started eating bananas, would the yellow peels turn the blue sky green?  Or if they developed a fondness for lemons, would the juice bleach the color out forever?  And if that happened, would your grandchildren ever believe the sky had once been blue? 

Or would they just think you were a silly writer telling stories about angels and blueberries?","The story begins with a question about why the sky is blue, and the narrator explains that different people provide different answers. According to grown-ups, the color of the sky is due to the way light interacts with air particles. Scientists offer a more complex explanation. However, writers offer various imaginative answers.

One answer suggests that the sky is blue because of the tiny particles of blue fingerpaint that dissolve into the air when children use it. These particles color the sky, and as long as fingerpainting continues, the sky will remain blue.

Another explanation involves the blue-eyed creatures living at the North and South Poles. These creatures always look up at the sky, and the blue of their eyes reflects back, giving the sky its blue color. These creatures are adept at hiding from satellites and explorers, so they remain unseen except for the reflection of their eyes.

The narrator's preferred explanation involves angels and blueberries. Angels love blueberries, and since they live forever, they have ample time to eat them. However, they are messy eaters, and bits of blueberry end up scattered all over the sky. Some angels even peel the blueberries and discard the skins, further adding to the mess. As the day progresses, the angels eat more berries, and the sky darkens with blue skins and bits of berry. Eventually, the sky becomes so filled with blueberry waste that no light can reach the Earth, except for small gaps for the moon and stars. God finally instructs the angels to clean up their mess, and as they do, light begins to penetrate the layer of blueberry waste. Dawn breaks when they clear away enough blueberries for the sun to shine on the Earth again. Although the blueberry stains on the sky cannot be completely removed, God finds them beautiful and is not concerned about them.

The story ends with a pondering about what would happen if the angels ever switched to eating different fruits, like raspberries or bananas. Would the sky change color accordingly? The narrator wonders if future generations would believe that the sky was once blue or if they would dismiss the stories as mere fantasies.","This story provides multiple imaginative and whimsical explanations for why the sky is blue. Different perspectives are presented, such as the scientific explanation involving light and air particles, the idea that blue sky is caused by tiny particles of blue fingerpaint, and the existence of blue-eyed creatures reflecting the blue of their eyes into the sky. However, the answer the narrator prefers revolves around angels and blueberries. According to this explanation, blueberries are the angels' favorite food, and as they eat throughout the day, bits of blueberry and blueberry skins end up in the sky. This causes the sky to gradually darken with blueberry waste, making it difficult for light to reach the Earth. Eventually, God instructs the angels to clean up their mess, and as they do, light begins to penetrate the layer of blueberry waste at dawn, leading to daylight. However, the blueberry skins stain the sky, resulting in variations of blue hues. Despite the staining, God appreciates the effort of the angels and finds the stained sky beautiful. The story ends with the narrator musing about the possibility of the sky changing color if the angels were to start eating different fruits, and whether future generations would believe in the once-blue sky or view it as a mere fictional tale.",s48
BABY DOLLS,Becky Robison,"My mother isn’t always Raggedy Ann, but she was when I was born. Week before Halloween, office party. Not at the office, but at Richard Nixon’s basement apartment. She sipped on Shirley Temples while my jelly fists pommeled her beneath her denim thrift-store jumper. I hate grenadine, but how was Raggedy Ann supposed to know that? Her brain was stuffing, and my communication was limited to pathetic fetal boxing. The drunk guests rollicked in their altered states. When fluid dampened her striped stockings, everyone laughed. Because she was a doll, and also very young, my mother laughed, too.

A cat whose tail was longer than her skirt laid Raggedy Ann in the bathtub and closed the moldy curtain. Her limbs stayed limp while people pissed nearby, and the tangled nest of red yarn remained on her head, drenched with sweat, for Raggedy Ann is loyal and true. Only I was able to bring her to life, each shock of me making bone and blood of her soft body, carving chambers into her two-dimensional valentine heart.","The narrator's mother, referred to as Raggedy Ann, is described as being like a doll when the narrator was born. The story begins with the narrator recounting a Halloween office party that took place in Richard Nixon's basement apartment. At the party, Raggedy Ann, who was pregnant with the narrator, drank Shirley Temples while the narrator's fists kicked and punched her from the inside. Despite not liking grenadine, Raggedy Ann couldn't have known this. The guests at the party, who were drunk and in altered states, found it amusing when fluid dampened Raggedy Ann's striped stockings, and she laughed along with them.

Later on, Raggedy Ann is laid in a bathtub by a cat with a tail longer than her skirt. The cat closes the moldy curtain, and Raggedy Ann's limbs remain limp while people urinate nearby. Throughout this ordeal, Raggedy Ann's red yarn hair, resembling that of the doll she is named after, stays drenched with sweat. However, it is revealed that only the narrator, through their movements inside Raggedy Ann's womb, is able to bring her to life. Each shock of the narrator's movements creates bone and blood within Raggedy Ann's soft body, carving chambers into her two-dimensional valentine heart.","The narrator begins by describing their mother as Raggedy Ann, in reference to a Halloween party where she dressed as the character. The party took place in Richard Nixon's basement apartment. While at the party, the narrator's mother sipped on Shirley Temples and the narrator playfully punched her from inside her womb. The narrator expresses a dislike for grenadine, a key ingredient in Shirley Temples. However, the mother was unaware of this preference due to her limited communication with the baby. The party guests, who were intoxicated, found amusement in the fact that the narrator's mother's striped stockings were dampened by fluid, likely from the fetus. Despite the embarrassing situation, the mother, being young and playful, joined in the laughter.

A cat with a tail longer than the mother's skirt then led Raggedy Ann to the bathtub and closed the moldy curtain. The mother's body became limp as people nearby urinated, while her red yarn wig remained on her head, soaked with sweat. The narrator explains that only they, as the baby inside the mother's womb, were able to bring Raggedy Ann to life. The shocks and movements of the narrator's body transformed the mother's soft doll-like body, giving it bones and blood and carving chambers into her heart. This implies a deep bond between the baby and the mother, with the baby having a significant impact on the mother's physical state.",s49
John Redding Goes to Sea,Zora Neale Hurston,"The Villagers said that John Redding was a queer child. His mother thought he was too. She would shake her head sadly, and observe to John’s father: “Alf, it’s too bad our boy’s got a spell on ’im.”

The father always met this lament with indifference, if not impatience.

“Aw, woman, stop dat talk ’bout conjure. Tain’t so nohow. Ah doan want Jawn tuh git dat foolishness in him.”

“Cose you allus tries tuh know mo’ than me, but Ah ain’t so ign’rant. Ah knows a heap mahself. Many and many’s the people been drove outa their senses by conjuration, or rid tuh deat’ by witches.”

“Ah keep on telling yuh, woman, tain’t so. B’lieve it all you wants tuh, but dontcha tell mah son none of it.”

Perhaps ten-year-old John was puzzling to the simple folk there in the Florida woods for he was an imaginative child and fond of day-dreams. The St. John River flowed a scarce three hundred feet from his back door. On its banks at this point grow numerous palms, luxuriant magnolias and bay trees with a dense undergrowth of ferns, cat-tails and rope-grass. On the bosom of the stream float millions of delicately colored hyacinths. The little brown boy loved to wander down to the water’s edge, and, casting in dry twigs, watch them sail away down stream to Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world and John Redding wanted to follow them.

Sometimes in his dreams he was a prince, riding away in a gorgeous carriage. Often he was a knight bestride a fiery charger prancing down the white shell road that led to distant lands. At other times he was a steamboat captain piloting his craft down the St. John River to where the sky seemed to touch the water. No matter what he dreamed or who he fancied himself to be, he always ended by riding away to the horizon; for in his childish ignorance he thought this to be farthest land.

But these twigs, which John called his ships, did not always sail away. Sometimes they would be swept in among the weeds growing in the shallow water, and be held there. One day his father came upon him scolding the weeds for stopping his sea-going vessels.

“Let go mah ships! You ole mean weeds you!” John screamed and stamped impotently. “They wants tuh go ’way. You let ’em go on!”

Alfred laid his hand on his son’s head lovingly. “What’s mattah, son?”

“Mah ships, pa,” the child answered weeping. “Ah throwed ’em in to go way off an’ them ole weeds won’t let ’em.”

“Well, well, doan cry. Ah thought youse uh grown up man. Men doan cry lak babies. You mustn’t take it too hard ’bout yo’ ships. You gotta git uster things gittin’ tied up. They’s lotser folks that ’ud go on off too ef somethin’ didn’ ketch ’em an’ hol’ ’em!”

Alfred Redding’s brown face grew wistful for a moment, and the child noticing it, asked quickly: “Do weeds tangle up folks too, pa?”

“Now, no, chile, doan be takin’ too much stock of what Ah say. Ah talks in parables sometimes. Come on, les go on tuh supper.”

Alf took his son’s hand, and started slowly toward the house. Soon John broke the silence.

“Pa, when Ah gets as big as you Ah’m goin’ farther than them ships. Ah’m goin’ to where the sky touches the ground.”

“Well, son, when Ah wuz a boy Ah said Ah wuz goin’ too, but heah Ah am. Ah hopes you have bettah luck than me.”

“Pa, Ah betcha Ah seen somethin’ in th’ woodlot you ain’t seen!”

“Whut?”

“See dat tallest pine tree ovah dere how it looks like a skull wid a crown on?”

“Yes, indeed!” said the father looking toward the tree designated. “It do look lak a skull since you call mah ’tention to it. You ’magine lotser things nobody else evah did, son!”

“Sometimes, Pa dat ole tree waves at me just aftah th’ sun goes down, an’ makes me sad an’ skeered, too.”

“Ah specks youse skeered of de dahk, thas all, sonny. When you gits biggah you won’t think of sich.”

Hand in hand the two trudged across the plowed land and up to the house, the child dreaming of the days when he should wander to far countries, and the man of the days when he might have—and thus they entered the kitchen.

Matty Redding, John’s mother, was setting the table for supper. She was a small wiry woman with large eyes that might have been beautiful when she was young, but too much weeping had left them watery and weak.

“Matty,” Alf began as he took his place at the table, “dontcha know our boy is different from any othah chile roun’ heah. He ’lows he’s goin’ to sea when he gits grown, an’ Ah reckon Ah’ll let ’im.”

The woman turned from the stove, skillet in hand. “Alf, you ain’t gone crazy, is you? John kain’t help wantin’ tuh stray off, cause he’s got a spell on ’im; but you oughter be shamed to be encouragin’ him.”

“Ain’t Ah done tol’ you forty times not tuh tahk dat low-life mess in front of mah boy?”

“Well, ef tain’t no conjure in de world, how come Mitch Potts been layin’ on his back six mont’s an’ de doctah kain’t do ’im no good? Answer me dat. The very night John wuz bawn, Granny seed ole Witch Judy Davis creepin outer dis yahd. You know she had swore tuh fix me fuh marryin’ you, ’way from her darter Edna. She put travel dust down fuh mah chile, dat’s whut she done, tuh make him walk ’way fum me. An’ evuh sence he’s been able tuh crawl, he’s been tryin tuh go.”

“Matty, a man doan need no travel dust tuh make ’im wanter hit de road. It jes’ comes natcheral fuh er man tuh travel. Dey all wants tuh go at some time or other but they kain’t all get away. Ah wants mah John tuh go an’ see cause Ah wanted to go mah self. When he comes back Ah kin see them furrin places wid his eyes. He kain’t help wantin’ tuh go cause he’s a man chile!”

Mrs. Redding promptly went off into a fit of weeping but the man and boy ate supper unmoved. Twelve years of married life had taught Alfred that far from being miserable when she wept, his wife was enjoying a bit of self-pity.

Thus John Redding grew to manhood, playing, studying and dreaming. He attended the village school as did most of the youth about him, but he also went to high school at the county seat where none of the villagers went. His father shared his dreams and ambitions, but his mother could not understand why he should wish to go strange places where neither she nor his father had been. No one of their community had ever been farther away than Jacksonville. Few indeed had ever been there. Their own gardens, general store, and occasional trips to the county seat—seven miles away—sufficed for all their needs. Life was simple indeed with these folk.

John was the subject of much discussion among the country folk. Why didn’t he teach school instead of thinking about strange places and people? Did he think himself better than any of the “gals” there about that he would not go a-courting any of them? He must be “fixed” as his mother claimed, else where did his queer notions come from? Well, he was always queer, and one could not expect the man to be different from the child. They never failed to stop work at the approach of Alfred in order to be at the fence and inquire after John’s health and ask when he expected to leave.

“Oh,” Alfred would answer. “Jes’ as soon as his mah gits reconciled to th’ notion. He’s a mighty dutiful boy, mah John is. He doan wanna hurt her feelings.”

The boy had on several occasions attempted to reconcile his mother to the notion, but found it a difficult task. Matty always took refuge in self-pity and tears. Her son’s desires were incomprehensible to her, that was all. She did not want to hurt him. It was love, mother love, that made her cling so desperately to John.

“Lawd knows,” she would sigh, “Ah nevah wuz happy an’ nevah specks tuh be.”

“An’ from yo’ actions,” put in Alfred hotly, “you’s determined not to be.”

“Thas right, Alfred, go on an’ ’buse me. You allus does. Ah knows Ah’m ign’rant an’ all dat, but dis is mah son. Ah bred an’ born ’im. He kain’t help from wantin’ to go rovin’ cause travel dust been put down fuh him. But mebbe we kin cure ’im by disincouragin’ the idee.”

“Well, Ah wants mah son tuh go; an’ he wants tuh go too. He’s a man now, Matty. An’ we mus’ let John hoe his own row. If it’s travelin’ twon’t be foh long. He’ll come back to us bettah than when he went off. What do you say, son?”

“Mamma,” John began slowly, “it hurts me to see you so troubled over my going away; but I feel that I must go. I’m stagnating here. This indolent atmosphere will stifle every bit of ambition that’s in me. Let me go mamma, please. What is there here for me? Why, sometimes I get to feeling just like a lump of dirt turned over by the plow—just where it falls there’s where it lies—no thought or movement or nothing. I wanter make myself something—not just stay where I was born.”

“Naw, John, it’s bettah for you to stay heah and take over the school. Why don’t you marry and settle down?”

“I don’t want to, mamma. I want to go away.”

“Well,” said Mrs. Redding, pursing her mouth tightly, “you ainta goin’ wid mah consent!”

“I’m sorry mamma, that you won’t consent. I am going nevertheless.”

“John, John, mah baby! You wouldn’t kill yo’ po’ ole mamma, would you? Come, kiss me, son.”

The boy flung his arms about his mother and held her closely while she sobbed on his breast. To all of her pleas, however, he answered that he must go.

“I’ll stay at home this year, mamma, then I’ll go for a while, but it won’t be long. I’ll come back and make you and papa oh so happy. Do you agree, mamma dear?”

“Ah reckon tain’ nothin’ tall fuh me to do else.”

Things went on very well around the Redding home for some time. During the day John helped his father about the farm and read a great deal at night.

Then the unexpected happened. John married Stella Kanty, a neighbor’s daughter. The courtship was brief but ardent—on John’s part at least. He danced with Stella at a candy-pulling, walked with her home and in three weeks had declared himself. Mrs. Redding declared that she was happier than she had ever been in her life. She therefore indulged in a whole afternoon of weeping. John’s change was occasioned possibly by the fact that Stella was really beautiful; he was young and red-blooded, and the time was spring.

Spring-time in Florida is not a matter of peeping violets or bursting buds merely. It is a riot of color in nature—glistening green leaves, pink, blue, purple, yellow blossoms that fairly stagger the visitor from the north. The miles of hyacinths lie like an undulating carpet on the surface of the river and divide reluctantly when the slow-moving alligators push their way log-like across. The nights are white nights for the moon shines with dazzling splendor, or in the absence of that goddess, the soft darkness creeps down laden with innumerable scents. The heavy fragrance of magnolias mingled with the delicate sweetness of jasmine and wild roses.

If time and propinquity conquered John, what then? These forces have overcome older men.

The raptures of the first few weeks over, John began to saunter out to the gate to gaze wistfully down the white dusty road; or to wander again to the river as he had done in childhood. To be sure he did not send forth twig-ships any longer, but his thoughts would in spite of himself, stray down river to Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world—and poor home-tied John Redding wanted to follow them.

He grew silent and pensive. Matty accounted for this by her ever-ready explanation of “conjuration.” Alfred said nothing but smoked and puttered about the barn more than ever. Stella accused her husband of indifference and made his life miserable with tears, accusations and pouting. At last John decided to bring matters to a head and broached the subject to his wife.

“Stella, dear, I want to go roving about the world for a spell. Would you stay here with papa and mamma and wait for me to come back?”

“John, is you crazy sho’ nuff? If you don’t want me, say so an’ I kin go home to mah folks.”

“Stella, darling, I do want you, but I want to go away too. I can have both if you’ll let me. We’ll be so happy when I return . . .”

“Naw, John, you kain’t rush me off one side like that. You didn’t hafta marry me. There’s a plenty othahs that would have been glad enuff tuh get me; you know Ah wan’t educated befo’ han’.”

“Don’t make me too conscious of my weakness, Stella. I know I should never have married with my inclinations, but it’s done now, no use to talk about what is past. I love you and want to keep you, but I can’t stifle that longing for the open road, rolling seas, for peoples and countries I have never seen. I’m suffering too, Stella, I’m paying for my rashness in marrying before I was ready. I’m not trying to shirk my duty—you’ll be well taken care of in the meanwhile.”

“John, folks allus said youse queer and tol’ me not to marry yuh, but Ah jes’ loved yuh so Ah couldn’t help it, an’ now to think you wants tuh sneak off an’ leave me.”

“But I’m coming back, darling . . . listen Stella.”

But the girl would not. Matty came in and Stella fell into her arms weeping. John’s mother immediately took up arms against him. The two women carried on such an effective war against him for the next few days that finally Alfred was forced to take his son’s part.

“Matty, let dat boy alone, Ah tell you! Ef he wuz uh homebuddy he’d be drove ’way by you all’s racket.”

“Well, Alf, dat’s all we po’ wimmen kin do. We wants our husbands an’ our sons. John’s got uh wife now, an’ he ain’t got no business to be talkin’ ’bout goin’ nowheres. I ’lowed dat marryin’ Stella would settle him.”

“Yas, dat’s all you wimmen study ’bout —settlin’ some man. You takes all de get-up out of ’em. Jes’ let uh fellah mak uh motion lak gettin’ somewhere, an’ some ’oman’ll begin tuh hollah, ‘Stop theah! where’s you goin’? Don’t fuhgit you b’longs tuh me.’ ”

“My Gawd! Alf! Whut you reckon Stella’s gwine do? Let John walk off an’ leave huh?”

“Naw, git outer huh foolishness an’ go ’long wid him. He’d take huh.”

“Stella ain’t got no call tuh go crazy ’cause John is. She ain’t no woman tuh be floppin’ roun’ from place tuh place lak some uh dese reps follerin’ uh section gang.”

The man turned abruptly from his wife and stood in the kitchen door. A blue haze hung over the river and Alfred’s attention seemed fixed upon this. In reality his thoughts were turned inward. He was thinking of the numerous occasions upon which he and his son had sat on the fallen log at the edge of the water and talked of John’s proposed travels. He had encouraged his son, given him every advantage his own poor circumstances would permit. And now John was home-tied.

The young man suddenly turned the corner of the house and approached his father.

“Hello, papa.”

“’Lo, son.”

“Where’s mamma and Stella?”

The older man merely jerked his thumb toward the interior of the house and once more gazed pensively toward the river. John entered the kitchen and kissed his mother fondly.

“Great news, mamma.”

“What now?”

“Got a chance to join the Navy, mamma, and go all around the world. Ain’t that grand?”

“John, you shorely ain’t gointer leave me an’ Stella, is yuh?”

“Yes, I think I am. I know how both of you feel, but I know how I feel, also. You preach to me the gospel of self-sacrifice for the happiness of others, but you are unwilling to practice any of it yourself. Stella can stay here—I am going to support her and spend all the time I can with her. I am going—that’s settled, but I want to go with your good will. I want to do something worthy of a strong man. I have done nothing so far but look to you and papa for everything. Let me learn to strive and think—in short, be a man.”

“Naw, John, Ah’ll nevah give mah consent. I know yous hard-headed jes’ lak yo’ paw; but if you leave dis place ovah mah head, Ah nevah wants you tuh come back heah no mo. Ef Ah wuz laid on de coolin’ board, Ah doan want yuh standin’ ovah me, young man. Doan even come neah mah grave, you ongrateful wretch!”

Mrs. Redding arose and flung out of the room. For once, she was too incensed to cry. John stood in his tracks, gone cold and numb at his mother’s pronouncement. Alfred, too, was moved. Mrs. Redding banged the bed-room door violently and startled John slightly. Alfred took his son’s arm, saying softly: “Come, son, let’s go down to the river.”

At the water’s edge they halted for a short space before seating themselves on the log. The sun was setting in a purple cloud. Hundreds of mosquito hawks darted here and there, catching gnats and being themselves caught by the lightning-swift bullbats. John abstractly snapped in two the stalk of a slender young bamboo. Taking no note of what he was doing, he broke it into short lengths and tossed them singly into the stream. The old man watched him silently for a while, but finally he said: “Oh, yes, my boy, some ships get tangled in the weeds.”

“Yes, papa, they certainly do. I guess I’m beaten—might as well surrender.”

“Nevah say die. Yuh nevah kin tell what will happen.”

“What can happen? I have courage enough to make things happen; but what can I do against mamma! What man wants to go on a long journey with his mother’s curses ringing in his ears? She doesn’t understand. I’ll wait another year, but I am going because I must.”

Alfred threw an arm about his son’s neck and drew him nearer but quickly removed it. Both men instantly drew apart, ashamed for having been so demonstrative. The father looked off to the woodlot and asked with a reminiscent smile: “Son, do you remember showin’ me the tree dat looked lak a skeleton head?”

“Yes, I do. It’s there still. I look at it sometimes when things have become too painful for me at the house, and I run down here to cool off and think. And every time I look at it, papa, it laughs at me like it had some grim joke up its sleeve.”

“Yuh wuz always imaginin’ things, John; things that nobody else evah thought on!”

“You know, papa, sometimes—I reckon my longing to get away makes me feel this way. . . . I feel that I am just earth, soil lying helpless to move myself, but thinking. I seem to hear herds of big beasts like horses and cows thundering over me, and rains beating down; and winds sweeping furiously over—all acting upon me, but me, well, just soil, feeling but not able to take part in it all. Then a soft wind like love passes over and warms me, and a summer rain comes down like understanding and softens me, and I push a blade of grass or a flower, or maybe a pine tree—that’s the ground thinking. Plants are ground thoughts, because the soil can’t move itself. Whenever I see little whirls of dust sailing down the road I always step aside—don’t want to stop ’em ’cause they’re on their shining way—moving! Oh, yes, I’m a dreamer. . . . I have such wonderfully complete dreams, papa. They never come true. But even as my dreams fade I have others.”

“Yas, son, Ah have them same feelings exactly, but Ah can’t find no words lak you do. It seems lak you an’ me see wid de same eyes, hear wid de same ears an’ even feel de same inside. Only thing you kin talk it an’ Ah can’t. But anyhow you speaks for me, so whut’s the difference?”

The men arose without more conversation. Possibly they feared to trust themselves to speech. As they walked leisurely toward the house Alfred remarked the freshness of the breeze.

“It’s about time the rains set in,” added his son. “The year is wearin’ on.”

After a gloomy supper John strolled out into the spacious front yard and seated himself beneath a China-berry tree. The breeze had grown a trifle stronger since sunset and continued from the south-east. Matty and Stella sat on the deep front porch, but Alfred joined John under the tree. The family was divided into two armed camps and the hostilities had reached that stage where no quarter could be asked or given.

About nine o’clock an automobile came flying down the dusty white road and halted at the gate. A white man slammed the gate and hurried up the walk toward the house, but stopped abruptly before the men beneath the China-berry. It was Mr. Hill, the builder of the new bridge that was to span the river.

“Howdy John, Howdy Alf. I’m mighty glad I found you. I am in trouble.”

“Well now, Mist’ Hill,” answered Alfred slowly but pleasantly. “We’se glad you foun’ us too. What trouble could you be having now?”

“It’s the bridge. The weather bureau says that the rains will be upon me in forty-eight hours. If it catches the bridge as it is now, I’m afraid all my work of the past five months will be swept away, to say nothing of a quarter of a million dollars’ worth of labor and material. I’ve got all my men at work now and I thought to get as many extra hands as I could t0 help out tonight and tomorrow. We can make her weather tight in that time if I can get about twenty more.”

“I’ll go, Mister Hill,” said John with a great deal of energy. “I don’t want papa out on that bridge—too dangerous.”

“Good for you, John!” cried the white man. “Now if I had a few more men of your brawn and brain, I could build an entirely new bridge in forty-eight hours. Come on and jump into the car. I am taking the men on down as I find them.”

“Wait a minute. I must put on my blue jeans. I won’t be long.”

John arose and strode to the house. He knew that his mother and wife had overheard everything, but he paused for a moment to speak to them.

“Mamma, I am going to work all night on the bridge.”

There was no answer. He turned to his wife.

“Stella, don’t be lonesome. I will be home at day-break.”

His wife was as silent as his mother. John stood for a moment on the steps, then resolutely strode past the women and into the house. A few minutes later he emerged clad in his blue overalls and brogans. This time he said nothing to the silent figures rocking back and forth on the porch. But when he was a few feet from the steps he called back: “Bye, mamma; bye, Stella,” and hurried on down the walk to where his father sat.

“So long, papa. I’ll be home around seven.”

Alfred roused himself and stood. Placing both hands upon his son’s broad shoulders he said softly: “Be keerful son, don’t fall or nothin’.”

“I will, papa. Don’t you get into a quarrel on my account.”

John hurried on to the waiting car and was whirled away.

Alfred sat for a long time beneath the tree where his son had left him and smoked on. The women soon went indoors. On the night breeze were borne numerous scents: of jasmine, of roses, of damp earth of the river, of the pine forest near by. A solitary whip-poor-will sent forth his plaintive call from the nearby shrubbery. A giant owl roared and boomed from the woodlot. The calf confined in the barn would bleat and be answered by his mother’s sympathetic “moo” from the pen. Away down in Lake Howell Creek the basso profundo of the alligators boomed and died, boomed and died.

Around ten o’clock the breeze freshened, growing stiffer until midnight when it became a gale. Alfred fastened the doors and bolted the wooden shutters at the windows. The three persons sat about a round deal table in the kitchen upon which stood a bulky kerosene lamp, flickering and sputtering in the wind that came in through the numerous cracks in the walls. The wind rushed down the chimney blowing puffs of ashes about the room. It banged the cooking utensils on the walls. The drinking gourd hanging outside by the door played a weird tattoo, hollow and unearthly, against the thin wooden wall.

The man and the women sat silently. Even if there had been no storm they would not have talked. They could not go to bed because the women were afraid to retire during a storm and the man wished to stay awake and think with his son. Thus they sat: the women hot with resentment toward the man and terrified by the storm; the man hardly mindful of the tempest but eating his heart out in pity for his boy. Time wore heavily on.

And now a new element of terror was added. A screech-owl alighted on the roof and shivered forth his doleful cry. Possibly he had been blown out of his nest by the wind. Matty started up at the sound but fell back in her chair, pale and trembling: “My Gawd!” she gasped, “dat’s a sho’ sign uh death.”

Stella hurriedly thrust her hand into the salt-jar and threw some into the chimney of the lamp. The color of the flame changed from yellow to blue-green but this burning of salt did not have the desired effect—to drive away the bird from the roof. Matty slipped out of her blue calico wrapper and turned it wrong side out before replacing it. Even Alfred turned one sock.

“Alf,” said Matty, “what do you reckon’s gonna happen from this?”

“How do Ah know, Matty?”

“Ah wisht John hadn’t went away from heah tuh night.”

“Humh.”

Outside the tempest raged. The palms rattled dryly and the giant pines groaned and sighed in the grip of the wind. Flying leaves and pine-mast filled the air. Now and then a brilliant flash of lightning disclosed a bird being blown here and there with the wind. The prodigious roar of the thunder seemed to rock the earth. Black clouds hung so low that the tops of the pines were among them moving slowly before the wind and made the darkness awful. The screech-owl continued his tremulous cry.

After three o’clock the wind ceased and the rain commenced. Huge drops clattered down upon the shingle roof like buckshot and ran from the eaves in torrents. It entered the house through the cracks in the walls and under the doors. It was a deluge in volume and force but subsided before morning.

The sun came up brightly on the havoc of the wind and rain calling forth millions of feathered creatures. The white sand everywhere was full of tiny cups dug out by the force of the falling raindrops. The rims of the little depressions crunched noisily underfoot.

At daybreak Mr. Redding set out for the bridge. He was uneasy. On arriving he found that the river had risen twelve feet during the cloudburst and was still rising. The slow St. John was swollen far beyond its banks and rushing on to sea like a mountain stream, sweeping away houses, great blocks of earth, cattle, trees—in short anything that came within its grasp. Even the steel framework of the new bridge was gone!

The siren of the fibre factory was tied down for half an hour, announcing the disaster to the country side. When Alfred arrived therefore he found nearly all the men of the district there.

The river, red and swollen, was full of floating debris. Huge trees were swept along as relentlessly as chicken coops and fence rails. Some steel piles were all that was left of the bridge.

Alfred went down to a group of men who were fishing members of the ill-fated construction gang out of the water. Many were able to swim ashore unassisted. Wagons backed up and were hurriedly driven away loaded with wet shivering men. Two men had been killed outright, others seriously wounded. Three men had been drowned. At last all had been accounted for except John Redding. His father ran here and there asking for him, or calling him. No one knew where he was. No one remembered seeing him since daybreak.

Dozens of women had arrived at the scene of the disaster by this time. Matty and Stella, wrapped in woolen shawls, were among them. They rushed to Alfred in alarm and asked where was John.

“Ah doan know,” answered Alfred impatiently, “that’s what Ah’m trying to fin’ out now.”

“Do you reckon he’s run away?” asked Stella thoughtlessly.

Matty bristled instantly.

“Naw,” she answered sternly, “he ain’t no sneak.”

The father turned to Fred Mimms, one of the survivors and asked him where John was and how had the bridge been destroyed.

“Yuh see,” said Mimms, “when dat turrible win’ come up we wuz out ’bout de middle of de river. Some of us wuz on de bridge, some on de derrick. De win’ blowed so hahd we could skeercely stan’ and Mist’ Hill tol’ us tuh set down fuh a spell. He’s ’fraid some of us mought go overboard. Den all of a sudden de lights went out—guess de wires wuz blowed down. We wuz all skeered tuh move for slippin’ overboard. Den dat rain commenced—an’ Ah nevah seed such a down-pour since de flood. We set dere and someone begins tuh pray. Lawd how we did pray tuh be spared! Den somebody raised a song an’ we sung, you hear me, we sung from de bottom of our hearts till daybreak. When the first light come we couldn’t see nothin’ but fog everywhere. You couldn’t tell which wuz water an’ which wuz lan’. But when de sun come up de fog begin to liff, an’ we could see de water. Dat fog wuz so thick an’ heavy dat it wuz huggin’ dat river lak a windin’ sheet. And when it rose we saw dat de river had rose way up durin’ the rain. My Gawd, Alf! it wuz runnin’ high—so high it nearly teched de span of de bridge—an’ red as blood! So much clay, you know from lan’ she done overflowed. Comin’ down stream, as fas’ as ’press train wuz three big pine trees. De first one wuzn’t fohty feet from us and there wasn’t no chance to do nothin’ but pray. De fust one struck us and shook de whole works an’ befo’ it could stop shakin’ the other two hit us an’ down we went. Ah thought Ah’d never see home again.”

“But, Mimms, where’s John?”

“Ah ain’t seen him, Alf, since de logs struck us. Mebbe he’s swum ashore, mebbe dey picked him up. What’s dat floatin’ way out dere in de water?”

Alfred shaded his eyes with his gnarled brown hand and gazed out into the stream. Sure enough there was a man floating on a piece of timber. He lay prone upon his back. His arms were outstretched, and the water washed over his brogans but his feet were lifted out of the water whenever the timber was buoyed up by the stream. His blue overalls were nearly torn from his body. A heavy piece of steel or timber had struck him in falling for his left side was laid open by the thrust. A great jagged hole wherein the double fists of a man might be thrust, could plainly be seen from the shore. The man was John Redding.

Everyone seemed to see him at once. Stella fell to the wet earth in a faint. Matty clung to her husband’s arm, weeping hysterically. Alfred stood very erect with his wife clinging tearfully to him, but he said nothing. A single tear hung on his lashes for a time then trickled slowly down his wrinkled brown cheek.

“Alf! Alf!” screamed Matty, “dere’s our son. Ah knowed when Ah heard dat owl las’ night. . . .”

“Ah see ’im, Matty,” returned her husband softly.

“Why is yuh standin’ heah? Go git mah boy.”

The men were manning a boat to rescue the remains of John Redding when Alfred spoke again.

“Mah po’ boy, his dreams never come true.”

“Alf,” complained Matty, “why doantcher hurry an’ git my boy—doantcher see he’s floatin’ on off?”

Her husband paid her no attention but addressed himself to the rescue-party.

“You all stop! Leave my boy go on. Doan stop ’im. Doan’ bring ’im back for dat ole tree to grin at. Leave him g’wan. He wants tuh go. Ah’m happy ’cause dis mawnin’ mah boy is goin’ tuh sea, he’s goin’ tuh sea.”

Out on the bosom of the river, bobbing up and down as if waving good bye, piloting his little craft on the shining river road, John Redding floated away toward Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world—at last.","John Redding, a young boy living in a small village in Florida, is known for his imaginative nature and daydreams. He often spends time by the river, throwing twigs into the water and imagining them sailing away to distant lands. John is determined to travel and see the world beyond his small village.

His parents, Alfred and Matty, have mixed feelings about John's dreams. Matty believes that John is under a spell and is destined to wander away, while Alfred encourages his son's dreams and supports his desire to travel.

As the North Wind Howled,Yu Hua,"Sunlight had sneaked in through the window and was creeping toward the chair where my pants dangled. I was lying bare-chested in bed, rubbing some gunk from the corner of my right eye. It must have collected while I was sleeping, and to just let it stay there seemed inappropriate. Meanwhile, my left eye was idle, so I gave it the job of looking at my pants. I had taken them off the night before, and now I regretted tossing them so casually over the chair, where they lay wrinkled and crumpled beside my jacket. As my left eye inspected them, I began to wonder whether while sleeping I had shed, snakelike, a layer of skin, for that’s what my jacket and pants looked like. At this point, a drop of sunshine reached my pant leg; the little splotch of leaping light made me think of a golden flea. And so I felt itchy all over and had my idle left hand make itself useful by scratching.

Someone was knocking on the door.

But who could it be? I was the only person with a reason to come here, and I was already here. So I decided to ignore the knocking and continue with my scratching. Now the door was making a colossal noise, as though it were about to cave in. The person outside, I realized, was knocking not with his hand but with his foot, and, before I had time to think of a response, the door fell to the floor with such a crash that it sent shock waves through me.

A brawny fellow with whiskers on his face charged over to my bed. “Your friend’s dying, and you’re still not up?” he yelled.

I’d never seen this man before. “Have you come to the wrong address?” I asked.

“No chance of that,” he answered.

His blithe self-assurance made me wonder whether I had somehow gone to sleep in the wrong bed. I jumped up and ran out into the corridor to check the number on the door. But, of course, the door was now lying on the floor of my apartment. On it was written “26 Hongqiao New Village, Apt. 3.”

“Is this the door you just kicked down?” I asked.

“Yes, it is,” he said.

So this was my apartment. “You have definitely come to the wrong place,” I told him.

Now it was my confident manner that confused him. He stared at me for a moment. “Are you or are you not Yu Hua?”

“Yes, I am,” I said, “but I don’t know you.”

He gave a roar of rage. “Your friend’s dying!”

“But I don’t have any friends!” I was roaring, too.

“That’s nonsense, you little philistine!” He glared.

“I’m no philistine,” I said. “You can see the proof of that in the books that fill my room. If you’re trying to offload this guy on me, I absolutely refuse, because I have never had a single friend. However—” I softened my tone. “However, feel free to donate him to my neighbor in Apartment 4. He’s got a lot of pals and I don’t think he’ll mind if you toss in another.”

“You fickle little philistine!” He stretched out an arm as thick as my shin and tried to pull my hair.

I shrank back to the corner of the bed, shouting desperately, “I’m not a philistine—and I’ve got the books to prove it.”

With his firm, cold hand, he grabbed my feeble, warm foot. Then he hauled me out of bed and dumped me on the floor. “Hurry up and get dressed,” he said. “Otherwise I’ll drag you all the way there just as you are.”

I knew it was pointless to argue any further with this guy, because he was at least five times as strong as me. “Seeing as a dying man wants to see me,” I told him, “of course I’m happy to go.”

So that was how, on this lousy morning, a muscleman kicked down my door and lumbered me with a friend I had no interest in having—a friend who was about to die, no less. What’s more, the north wind was howling like a banshee outside. I had no overcoat or scarf, no gloves or hat—all I was wearing was a thin jacket as I went off to visit this friend I knew absolutely nothing about.

Once we were in the street, the north wind blew me and the big fellow to the friend’s house just as quickly as it would blow leaves off a tree. The doorway was piled high with wreaths. The big fellow turned to me and said dolefully, “Your friend is dead.”

Before I had time to consider whether this was a cause for rejoicing or for grief, I heard a loud chorus of weeping, toward which the big fellow proceeded to push me.

A crowd of tearful men and women surrounded me. “Don’t take things so hard,” they told me solicitously.

All I could do was nod and put on a show of being sad, because now there was no point in saying the things I really wanted to say. I gently patted their shoulders, showing my appreciation for their condolences.

Then an old lady tottered forward and grabbed my hand as tears poured down her face. “My son is dead,” she sobbed.

“I know,” I said. “I am very sad, because it all happened so suddenly.”

My comment loosened the floodgates still further, and her wails were now so piercing my hair stood on end.

“Please don’t take it so hard,” I said.

Her crying seemed to subside a little and she began to dry her tears with my hand. Then she raised her head and said, “You need to take it in stride, too.”

I nodded reassuringly. “Oh, I will do that. We must transform grief into strength.”

She nodded. “My son closed his eyes before you could get here. You don’t blame him, do you?”

“No, I’d never do that,” I said.

Again she fell into a fit of sobbing. After a while she recovered enough to say, “He was the only son I had, but he’s dead. You’re my son now.”

Tugging desperately, I was finally able to retrieve my hand, on the pretext that I needed it to wipe away my own tears, though I had none. Then I said, “Actually, I’ve thought of you as my mother for a long time now.” I had no choice but to say that.

She led me to another room, saying, “Go in and keep my son company for a bit.”

The room was empty, apart from a dead man lying in a bed under a white shroud. The chair next to the bed seemed to be meant for me, so I sat down.

I sat there for a good long time before lifting the shroud to see what the man looked like. I glimpsed a pale face that gave little indication of age, a face I had never seen before. I put the shroud back and thought, So that’s my friend.

There I sat, next to the corpse whose face I had just seen but instantly forgotten. Although the man’s death had delivered me from a friendship I refused to recognize, it had not relieved me of my burden, for his mother had simply taken his place: an old woman I did not know had become my mother. It was only too clear what I had to do next: I’d have to fork out twenty yuan to buy a big wreath; I’d have to don sackcloth and guard his coffin; I’d have to weep and wail and parade through the streets with one arm around the cremation urn and the other propping up his mother. And, after all that was over, I’d have to sweep his grave every April, not to mention carry on his unfinished labors and perform the duties of a filial son. But the first order of business—and the most important thing, as far as I was concerned—was to find a carpenter to rehang the door that the big fellow had kicked down. Right now, however, all I could do was stay with this confounded corpse.","The protagonist of the story wakes up in bed, noticing the sunlight creeping in and gunk in his eye.

The Comedian,Yoko Morgenstern,"Nina’s Saturday has begun just like the past three weeks. In the kitchen, she makes herself a bowl of Cheerios. It’s a weekend, so she treats herself to a jar of blueberry yogurt. She twists the lid off and licks the smear.

It’s 3:00. Chloe is picking her up soon. It’s darkening outside. There’s a rumble in the distance. Thunder spoils milk, her Granny would say. Having lived in Canada for half a century, she never forgot German sayings. Nina empties the rest of the milk into a glass and drinks it up.

They’ve arrived at the Bavarian Forest Restaurant in Kitchener. The pink neon sign, of which only the “Forest” part remains, buzzes feebly.

This is their fourth gig at the Bavarian Forest as dancers. A singer and a comedian are also part of the team. Today, instead of Dave, there’s a new comedian. But they aren’t surprised. Comedians come, comedians go. Singers come, singers go. Backstage, Chloe and Nina put on their Rio-the-Carnival costumes. Nina puts a tiara on her head. A slight headache has already begun.

The air in the restaurant is stagnant, like that of the Amazon rainforest. Offstage Nina sees Linda humming, pearls of perspiration on her forehead. Nina and Chloe come onstage from either side, eyeing each other with pasted-on smiles. The rhythm doubles. Samba. The scent of Chloe’s coconut oil lingers in the air, and Nina thinks of her piña colada at the Copacabana. The red-cheeked old men behind the beer steins catapult their arms into the air, iPhones in their hands.

That’s okay. People staring at Nina know that she is a dancer. She is, not she wants to be. Just like she is a woman, is 25, is Canadian. She is, even though she isn’t on Broadway, in Kitchener.

That’s why she doesn’t have a day job. Because she is a dancer. For Granny it wasn’t an occupation. Every day since she’d left college, Granny put a yellow Post-it on the door of her room: “What are you going to do with your life?” When she was about to go on a Contiki tour through South America—unlike most of her friends who took grand European tours—the note read: “You want to die before you live?”

In the hall, Nina finds Chloe sitting on a young man’s lap, still in her Rio dress. A large, rugged hand is petting her belly.

“Oh, hey,” she says, looking at Nina, labouring to smile.

Yes, Nina knows this. If only this wasn’t two hours away from home, she’d let her go with him. But she can’t. She wants to go back home. “Er—I’m ready to go.”

“Sure, yeah.”

“Hey,” a calm, deep voice pops up from behind Nina. She turns around. There stands the comedian. She sees him better now that he’s without his makeup. Well into his thirties, his hair a straight dark blond, his eyes green, his lips thin. “If you need a ride, I could take you.”

What other options does she have?

His Focus heads back to Toronto on the 401. It’s begun to rain. Neither of them talks. All she hears is the shush of the tires. Suddenly he asks, “Where do you live?”

“Runnymede.”

He doesn’t answer. He looks into the rear-view mirror, squinting at the high-beams from behind.

He turns on the radio. A female, country pop-star is playing.

“Bitch,” he mumbles. “I teamed up with her in Ottawa a long time ago.” He glances sideways at Nina for a second. “Just for one night. She slept with the manager of the club and the next day we all got let go. She got her happy-solo-gig-ever-after.”

Silence falls. Ooh, Nina says, in an almost inaudible voice.

“What are you up to tomorrow?” he asks.

She thinks about Sundays. Are they different in any way from Saturdays? She sleeps in, pours the rest of Cheerios into her mouth directly out of the box, eats chocolate bars. Mumbles to herself, gets drunk in the early afternoon, and watches random video clips on YouTube for hours. Oh, sometimes she smashes the Rio costume against the wall; what she doesn’t do on Saturdays.

“Nothing special,” she says. “You?”

“Me?” he says. “I’ll cry.”

“Cry?” She turns to him. “But… you’re a comedian.”

“So?” He shifts to the left lane and passes a car. “Crying is healthy.”

She doesn’t know what to say.

“You wanna join me sometime?” he asks.

“Join what, crying?” Here you go. She squirms in her seat. She searches for the right words, just like when she brushes off someone at the bar counter after getting a free drink from him.

A green sign comes into sight, a heads-up for the junction ahead. “I live in Oakville, actually,” he says.

“Why didn’t you tell me?” she says, relieved on the changed topic. “I feel bad. Oh. You’re going all the way to—”

“Not a big deal.”

“It’s a pretty little town, isn’t it? Oakville.”

“Yes, it is.”

She wants to say something more about it, but actually she doesn’t really know Oakville. “The lake—”

“You know what it’s like at the end of Trafalgar?” he speaks over her. “Trafalgar’s like Yonge Street to you guys, the busiest street in town. You drive down south on Trafalgar and pass Lakeshore, and it dwindles and dwindles until it gets to the lake, and there,” he says, going back to the right lane, “is a bench. Just a tiny little bench at the end of Trafalgar, looking down at the lake.”

“And there you cry.”

“Sometimes,” he says. “Toronto’s skyline makes me cry.”

“How come?”

He muses for a while. “I guess I just want someone to take me out for a drink.”

In front of her apartment, she half-turns to him, his face lit orange by the streetlights. “Thank you,” she says.

He gives a small nod.

“Maybe I’ll join you sometime.” She opens the door of the passenger seat. “One of these Sundays.”","Nina begins her Saturday morning like the past few weeks, making herself breakfast and treating herself to blueberry yogurt. Chloe is picking her up soon for their gig at the Bavarian Forest Restaurant in Kitchener. As they prepare backstage, Nina puts on her carnival costume and feels a slight headache coming on.

During their performance, the audience is engaged, and Nina notices Chloe sitting on a man's lap in her costume. Nina decides it's time to leave and asks Chloe if she's ready to go. On their way back home, they are joined by the comedian who performed with them at the restaurant. He offers Nina a ride, and she accepts.

During the drive, they don't talk much, but the comedian shares a story about a singer he worked with in the past. They discuss their plans for the next day, and the comedian mentions that he cries on Sundays. He invites Nina to join him sometime, and she considers it.

As they approach Oakville, the comedian talks about the town and a bench by the lake where he sometimes goes to cry. He mentions that Toronto's skyline also makes him cry. When they reach Nina's apartment, she thanks him and expresses the possibility of joining him for a drink on a Sunday in the future.","Nina's Saturday begins like any other weekend. She enjoys a bowl of Cheerios with blueberry yogurt and prepares for her gig at the Bavarian Forest Restaurant in Kitchener, where she performs as a dancer. Backstage, she and her fellow dancer, Chloe, get ready in their Rio-the-Carnival costumes. Onstage, they captivate the audience with their samba routine, but Nina can't help but feel a slight headache coming on.

After the performance, Nina finds Chloe sitting on a man's lap, and she decides it's time to leave. As she waits in the hall, the new comedian from their performance offers her a ride back to Toronto, where she lives. She accepts, and they depart in his car. On the way, the comedian, whose name she doesn't know, shares a story about a singer he once performed with, which leads to a conversation about crying.

Curious, the comedian asks Nina if she would like to join him sometime when he cries. She initially hesitates but changes the topic to the town of Oakville, where he lives. He describes a peaceful bench by the lake that sometimes makes him cry. As they approach Nina's apartment, she thanks him and expresses the possibility of joining him on a Sunday for a drink. She leaves the car, leaving the door open for a potential future encounter with the comedian.",s52
Last Long Night,Lina Rather,"Two months after the last broken transmission from Earth, somewhere in the unexplored dark, we found a voice.

At first we thought it was a mass hallucination. We’d been alone in space too long. Back home, we’d be treated for space sickness and starlust, our brains scanned and studied for signs that our grey matter had deteriorated in the vacuum. We’d be swaddled in hospitals, kept barefoot and away from the night sky until we stopped dreaming of plumed nebulas and stopped thinking we could hear the music of the spheres in C minor.

But there was no more Earth, and we were lost, limping along to a semi-terraformed planet we were supposed to be studying and would now be colonizing. We’d taken to talking each other away from the airlock when the stars started looking like houses in the distance and confirming reality as a matter of course. We might all lose our minds, but probably not at the same time.

“Does this taste like banana?” Lucinda asked, chewing on a freeze-dried ration. And we’d all nod.

“I hear someone breathing out there,” Antin murmured, standing at one of the portholes. And we’d all say no, it’s only rock and plasma, come away from there, look at us instead.

So when Carl found the signal and the voice crackled through the speakers, he asked, “Do you hear a voice?”

“Yes,” said Jane, and Lucinda, and then one by one we all confirmed that we did hear a voice. Muttering, male, half-covered in static. We all bent close to the speakers.

The voice coughed, and paused, and Lucinda covered her mouth.

Breath rattled. More words.

“It’s Russian,” Antin whispered. None of the rest of us spoke it. Hardly anyone in the space programs did anymore. Russia died at the beginning of the slow end. He swayed in time with the enunciation. “He says he’s lost. Over and over. He’s lost.”

He grabbed the mic before the rest of us could stop him and broadcast out into the black. “Zdravstvujtye? Zdravstvujtye?“

A pause. We held our breath, our hearts waiting for the next word to start beating again. It had been so long since we’d savored the sound of a stranger’s voice.

He began again. The same pattern.

“It’s a recording,” Carl said. He had tears in his eyes. One ended up in his mustache, a shimmer in the energy-efficient lighting.

We let the voice play all night, damn the fuel reserves, damn the razor-thin margins between death and life on a barely-habitable planet.

The next day, we found the ship. Late twentieth century as near as anyone could guess. Our scanners were calibrated for geological identifications only. We didn’t know what trick of folding space brought it here. The hull was pitted with burn marks and long scratches from debris. It was just big enough for one person who wasn’t claustrophobic.

Matt and Amal volunteered to go aboard. Amal was forty, probably too old to have children when we made landfall. Matt insisted. We could have debated the impact their possible deaths would have on our as-yet-hypothetical colony, but none of the rest of us wanted to stop them. We helped them put on the suits and tethers.

“It’s cold,” Amal said when she made it aboard. Her chattering teeth made the radio pop. “There he is. Look.”

They had a camera and we tumbled over each other in a mess of arms and legs and sweating palms to get close to the screen. Lucinda and Regan–who loved each other so secretly that even they didn’t know it yet–held onto each other’s forearms so tight that Lucinda had waning moon scars from Regan’s nails for the rest of her life. Antin’s mouth twitched, and we all knew he was aching for the cigarettes he’d given up to see the stars.

Amal held the camera up to where the cosmonaut’s eyes used to be. He’d been handsome. He had a vintage face out of the days of Hugo Boss and ships caught in the orbit of a single planet.

“Do you know who he is?” Carl asked.

Antin shook his head. His hands still didn’t know what to do. “There were so many lost in the early days. When my mother was a child, her class listened to the audio of Vladimir Komarov sobbing.”

Matt’s breath was the rush of the ocean half-remembered. In and out and in and out. “I don’t want to die up here like that.”

Amal touched the dead man’s cheek with one gloved finger. With all the air gone, he was a facsimile of human still, even after these hundreds of years. “Hush. We won’t die. Think of everything that aligned for you to be here, at the right moment and the right velocity, at the same time as he is. We are in the presence of a miracle. Of a universal astronomical improbability. No one is going to die.”

“I don’t believe in signs,” Lucinda said from the deck of our ship, with her arms still bleeding in Regan’s hands. She didn’t mean it.

Matt went to his knees. Amal smoothed her other hand over his helmet and it would have been comforting had they not been separated by six layers of Mylar and mysterious alloys. She kept her other hand on the cosmonaut, and for a moment the dead Earth and the new were separated by only a touch.

We stripped the old ship for precious metals and spare parts, liquefied the body for the carbon. Our fuel reserves rose above the margin of error. We collected the ice crystals from the interior and thrilled at the taste of unfiltered water. It tasted like dust and dirt and everything else we wouldn’t see again for months.

We kept the recording. Matt played it when we dimmed the lights for nighttime. A voice in the dark, the last stranger, who found us all this way from home.","In this story, a group of astronauts is on a mission to colonize a semi-terraformed planet after losing contact with Earth. They have been in space for a long time and are starting to experience hallucinations and doubts about their sanity. One day, they discover a voice coming through the speakers, speaking in Russian. The voice repeats that it is lost. The astronauts listen to the voice all night, finding solace in the sound of a stranger's voice. The next day, they find a ship from the late twentieth century and two astronauts, Matt and Amal, volunteer to explore it. Inside the ship, they find the body of a cosmonaut. The crew is fascinated by the cosmonaut and the serendipity of their meeting. They strip the ship for supplies and fuel, and keep the recording of the Russian voice as a reminder of the last stranger they encountered.","In this story, a group of astronauts on their way to colonize a semi-terraformed planet discover a voice coming from the depths of space. Initially dismissing it as a hallucination caused by their extended time in space, they soon realize it is a real voice, speaking Russian and repeating that it is lost. The astronauts become captivated by the voice, feeling a desperate longing for human connection after being cut off from Earth for so long.

Upon following the signal, they discover a ship from the late twentieth century, pockmarked with burn marks and scratches. Two of the astronauts, Matt and Amal, voluntarily board the ship to investigate further. Inside, they find the corpse of a cosmonaut, a remnant from the early days of space exploration. The sight of the dead cosmonaut triggers deep emotions within the group. They realize the fragility of their own existence and the possibility of meeting the same fate.

Amal comforts Matt, reminding him of the extraordinary odds that brought them all together. She sees their encounter with the dead cosmonaut as a miraculous alignment of the universe. Despite their fears, they decide to approach this discovery as a sign of hope rather than impending doom.

The astronauts salvage the ship for valuable resources and keep the recording of the Russian voice. They find solace in playing the recording during the quiet nights, finding comfort in the presence of a stranger's voice in the darkness of space.",s53
The Virgin Mary,Adesuwa Agbonile,"It doesn’t make the sound that you think it would make. I mean, I figured it would be loud, or top-heavy. But it sounded like almost nothing, like water dripping from a shower faucet three rooms away. The only reason I knew what had happened at all was the communion table splitting clean in half, scattering the grape juice and the crackers everywhere.

I stepped over Jesus’ body and his blood on my way out.

The church was the biggest building in our whole neighborhood, which is to say, it was small, so small the mural painter could only fit two members of the Holy Trinity onto the biggest wall. My father had to reassure the town that the Holy Ghost was invisible, anyway, and lived inside of all of us, so, it was fine either way. My father was the head pastor. And on Sunday morning the town—all three hundred and two members—entered church and saw the broken communion table and all that spilt body and blood.

Well, there were murmurs.

Martha Lou, rubbing coconut lotion into her palms: “I mean, I’m not one for superstition but, we find little Mary’s body, and then all this madness with the table—!”

Bobby Greene, with an only half secured toupee: “—I heard Mary was with child, that tiny little thing, and what, only nineteen—?!”

Jilly Jean, who carried washed Tupperware in her purse, just in case: “That little thing? Not even old enough to be married, much less—well, and just the other day she was baptized by the head pastor himself, practically reciting his sermons verbatim, and then all this—”

Bill Lewis, who routinely lied about golfing on the weekends: “Pregnant and everything, oh, the poor thing, well, I’m sure this isn’t the first young unmarried girl who winds up with a baby and then, you know, winds up dead, as horrible as it sounds, I mean, you know—”

And they did know. Everyone knew.

It got so bad, during his sermon, my father threw in a line about faith, and always having it, even when strange things like young girls dying too soon and communion tables breaking clean in half happened. And that was that: my father had spoken. The murmurs stilled almost instantly.

Father, gruffly: “Son, hand me that piece of wood.”

He was making a new communion table. Corkscrew wood shavings littered the floor—tiny pieces of holy to be swept up and thrown away. He was building God from scratch—tiny pieces of conviction and power that would be collected with the care of a creator molding his creation, to be put into the pockets of people’s minds until they forgot that it was there altogether.

From outside the church window, you could see the track field. Four boys, lanky and tan, were racing against each other. First one pulled ahead, then another, then another. Girls on the sidelines stood cheering, occasionally ripping up grass and throwing it at each other. Finally, one of the boys—the one with long hair—won. He sprawled out on the track, chest heaving. I watched him throw his arms up in the air—another triumph over the invisible ghosts in our sky.

Me, the son: “You’ve heard the rumors, right?”

Father: “The Bible wasn’t written on rumors.”

Me, ignoring Father: “They’re saying that Mary was pregnant when she died.”

Father continued sanding.

Me: “And I’m thinking, well, I’m thinking about all the times we had her over. Especially when mom was away. I’m thinking, like, she stayed late a lot, and, you were gone a lot, with her, I’m guessing, and well, now she’s dead. And so, I guess—I guess I’m thinking, it was you and it was your baby, and well—well, I’ve heard the stories, you know, about unmarried girls and their babies and the people with reputations to keep who kill them. So.”

Father had stopped sanding the table. His hands were shaking. Hard. He said nothing.

Then, Me, again: “I went into church yesterday, after they found it, you know, her body? And I think I heard—I think I heard god. Except, he didn’t say anything, it just sounded like he was running. Running away. From you—from us—from everything.”

There was a silence. Well, an almost silence. I could hear something like a shower faucet, dripping three—maybe even six or seven—rooms away.","In this story, the narrator is the son of the head pastor of a small church in a small neighborhood. The story begins with the narrator describing an incident at the church where the communion table splits in half, causing a commotion among the church members. The town starts to gossip about a young girl named Mary who was found dead and rumors circulate that she was pregnant.

A Good Man is Hard to Find,Flannery O'Connor,"THE GRANDMOTHER didn't want to go to Florida. She wanted to visit some of her connections in east Tennessee and she was seizing at every chance to change Bailey's mind. Bailey was the son she lived with, her only boy. He was sitting on the edge of his chair at the table, bent over the orange sports section of the Journal. ""Now look here, Bailey,"" she said, ""see here, read this,"" and she stood with one hand on her thin hip and the other rattling the newspaper at his bald head. ""Here this fellow that calls himself The Misfit is aloose from the Federal Pen and headed toward Florida and you read here what it says he did to these people. Just you read it. I wouldn't take my children in any direction with a criminal like that aloose in it. I couldn't answer to my conscience if I did.""

Bailey didn't look up from his reading so she wheeled around then and faced the children's mother, a young woman in slacks, whose face was as broad and innocent as a cabbage and was tied around with a green head-kerchief that had two points on the top like rabbit's ears. She was sitting on the sofa, feeding the baby his apricots out of a jar. ""The children have been to Florida before,"" the old lady said. ""You all ought to take them somewhere else for a change so they would see different parts of the world and be broad. They never have been to east Tennessee.""

The children's mother didn't seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, John Wesley, a stocky child with glasses, said, ""If you don't want to go to Florida, why dontcha stay at home?"" He and the little girl, June Star, were reading the funny papers on the floor.

""She wouldn't stay at home to be queen for a day,"" June Star said without raising her yellow head.

""Yes and what would you do if this fellow, The Misfit, caught you?"" the grandmother asked.

""I'd smack his face,"" John Wesley said.

""She wouldn't stay at home for a million bucks,"" June Star said. ""Afraid she'd miss something. She has to go everywhere we go.""

""All right, Miss,"" the grandmother said. ""Just remember that the next time you want me to curl your hair.""

June Star said her hair was naturally curly.

The next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. She had her big black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it she was hiding a basket with Pitty Sing, the cat, in it. She didn't intend for the cat to be left alone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he might brush against one of the gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. Her son, Bailey, didn't like to arrive at a motel with a cat.

She sat in the middle of the back seat with John Wesley and June Star on either side of her. Bailey and the children's mother and the baby sat in front and they left Atlanta at eight forty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. The grandmother wrote this down because she thought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. It took them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city.

The old lady settled herself comfortably, removing her white cotton gloves and putting them up with her purse on the shelf in front of the back window. The children's mother still had on slacks and still had her head tied up in a green kerchief, but the grandmother had on a navy blue straw sailor hat with a bunch of white violets on the brim and a navy blue dress with a small white dot in the print. Her collars and cuffs were white organdy trimmed with lace and at her neckline she had pinned a purple spray of cloth violets containing a sachet. In case of an accident, anyone seeing her dead on the highway would know at once that she was a lady.

She said she thought it was going to be a good day for driving, neither too hot nor too cold, and she cautioned Bailey that the speed limit was fifty-five miles an hour and that the patrolmen hid themselves behind billboards and small clumps of trees and sped out after you before you had a chance to slow down. She pointed out interesting details of the scenery: Stone Mountain; the blue granite that in some places came up to both sides of the highway; the brilliant red clay banks slightly streaked with purple; and the various crops

that made rows of green lace-work on the ground. The trees were full of silver-white sunlight and the meanest of them sparkled. The children were reading comic magazines and their mother had gone back to sleep.

""Let's go through Georgia fast so we won't have to look at it much,"" John Wesley said.

""If I were a little boy,"" said the grandmother, ""I wouldn't talk about my native state that way. Tennessee has the mountains and Georgia has the hills.""

""Tennessee is just a hillbilly dumping ground,"" John Wesley said, ""and Georgia is a lousy state too.""

""You said it,"" June Star said.

""In my time,"" said the grandmother, folding her thin veined fingers, ""children were more respectful of their native states and their parents and everything else. People did right then. Oh look at the cute little pickaninny!"" she said and pointed to a Negro child standing in the door of a shack. ""Wouldn't that make a picture, now?"" she asked and they all turned and looked at the little Negro out of the back window. He waved.

""He didn't have any britches on,"" June Star said.

""He probably didn't have any,"" the grandmother explained. ""Little niggers in the country don't have things like we do. If I could paint, I'd paint that picture,"" she said.

The children exchanged comic books.

The grandmother offered to hold the baby and the children's mother passed him over the front seat to her. She set him on her knee and bounced him and told him about the things they were passing. She rolled her eyes and screwed up her mouth and stuck her leathery thin face into his smooth bland one. Occasionally he gave her a faraway smile. They passed a large cotton field with five or six graves fenced in the middle of it, like a small island. ""Look at the graveyard!"" the grandmother said, pointing it out. ""That was the old family burying ground. That belonged to the plantation.""

""Where's the plantation?"" John Wesley asked.

""Gone With the Wind,"" said the grandmother. ""Ha. Ha.""

When the children finished all the comic books they had brought, they opened the lunch and ate it. The grandmother ate a peanut butter sandwich and an olive and would not let

the children throw the box and the paper napkins out the window. When there was nothing else to do they played a game by choosing a cloud and making the other two guess what shape it suggested. John Wesley took one the shape of a cow and June Star guessed a cow and John Wesley said, no, an automobile, and June Star said he didn't play fair, and they began to slap each other over the grandmother.

The grandmother said she would tell them a story if they would keep quiet. When she told a story, she rolled her eyes and waved her head and was very dramatic. She said once when she was a maiden lady she had been courted by a Mr. Edgar Atkins Teagarden from Jasper, Georgia. She said he was a very good-looking man and a gentleman and that he brought her a watermelon every Saturday afternoon with his initials cut in it, E. A. T. Well, one Saturday, she said, Mr. Teagarden brought the watermelon and there was nobody at home and he left it on the front porch and returned in his buggy to Jasper, but she never got the watermelon, she said, because a nigger boy ate it when he saw the initials, E. A. T.! This story tickled John Wesley's funny bone and he giggled and giggled but June Star didn't think it was any good. She said she wouldn't marry a man that just brought her a watermelon on Saturday. The grandmother said she would have done well to marry Mr. Teagarden because he was a gentleman and had bought Coca-Cola stock when it first came out and that he had died only a few years ago, a very wealthy man.

They stopped at The Tower for barbecued sandwiches. The Tower was a part stucco and part wood filling station and dance hall set in a clearing outside of Timothy. A fat man named Red Sammy Butts ran it and there were signs stuck here and there on the building and for miles up and down the highway saying, TRY RED SAMMY'S FAMOUS BARBECUE. NONE LIKE FAMOUS RED SAMMY'S! RED SAM! THE FAT BOY WITH THE HAPPY LAUGH. A VETERAN! RED SAMMY'S YOUR MAN!

Red Sammy was lying on the bare ground outside The Tower with his head under a truck while a gray monkey about a foot high, chained to a small chinaberry tree, chattered nearby. The monkey sprang back into the tree and got on the highest limb as soon as he saw the children jump out of the car and run toward him.

Inside, The Tower was a long dark room with a counter at one end and tables at the other and dancing space in the middle. They all sat down at a board table next to the nickelodeon and Red Sam's wife, a tall burnt-brown woman with hair and eyes lighter than her skin, came and took their order. The children's mother put a dime in the machine and played ""The Tennessee Waltz,"" and the grandmother said that tune always made her want to dance. She asked Bailey if he would like to dance but he only glared at her. He didn't have a naturally sunny disposition like she did and trips made him nervous. The grandmother's brown eyes were very bright. She swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her chair. June Star said play something she could tap to so the children's mother put in another dime and played a fast number and June Star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap routine.

""Ain't she cute?"" Red Sam's wife said, leaning over the counter. ""Would you like to come be my little girl?""

""No I certainly wouldn't,"" June Star said. ""I wouldn't live in a broken-down place like this for a minion bucks!"" and she ran back to the table.

""Ain't she cute?"" the woman repeated, stretching her mouth politely.

""Arn't you ashamed?"" hissed the grandmother.

Red Sam came in and told his wife to quit lounging on the counter and hurry up with these people's order. His khaki trousers reached just to his hip bones and his stomach hung over them like a sack of meal swaying under his shirt. He came over and sat down at a table nearby and let out a combination sigh and yodel. ""You can't win,"" he said. ""You can't win,"" and he wiped his sweating red face off with a gray handkerchief. ""These days you don't know who to trust,"" he said. ""Ain't that the truth?""

""People are certainly not nice like they used to be,"" said the grandmother.

""Two fellers come in here last week,"" Red Sammy said, ""driving a Chrysler. It was a old beat-up car but it was a good one and these boys looked all right to me. Said they worked

at the mill and you know I let them fellers charge the gas they bought? Now why did I do that?""

""Because you're a good man!"" the grandmother said at once.

""Yes'm, I suppose so,"" Red Sam said as if he were struck with this answer.

His wife brought the orders, carrying the five plates all at once without a tray, two in each hand and one balanced on her arm. ""It isn't a soul in this green world of God's that you can trust,"" she said. ""And I don't count nobody out of that, not nobody,"" she repeated, looking at Red Sammy.

""Did you read about that criminal, The Misfit, that's escaped?"" asked the grandmother.

""I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he didn't attact this place right here,"" said the woman. ""If he hears about it being here,I wouldn't be none surprised to see him. If he hears it's two cent in the cash register, I wouldn't be a tall surprised if he . . .""

""That'll do,"" Red Sam said. ""Go bring these people their Co'-Colas,"" and the woman went off to get the rest of the order.

""A good man is hard to find,"" Red Sammy said. ""Every- thing is getting terrible. I remember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more.""

He and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion Europe was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you would think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was exactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the lacy chinaberry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully between his teeth as if it were a delicacy.

They drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grand- mother took cat naps and woke up every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled an old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady. She said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks leading up to it and two little wooden trellis

arbors on either side in front where you sat down with your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to it. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the more she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin arbors were still standing. ""There was a secret panel in this house,"" she said craftily, not telling the truth but wishing that she were, ""and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in it when Sherman came through but it was never found . . .""

""Hey!"" John Wesley said. ""Let's go see it! We'll find it! We'll poke all the woodwork and find it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can't we turn off there?""

""We never have seen a house with a secret panel!"" June Star shrieked. ""Let's go to the house with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can't we go see the house with the secret panel!""

""It's not far from here, I know,"" the grandmother said. ""It wouldn't take over twenty minutes.""

Bailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. ""No,"" he said.

The children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret panel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother's shoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their vacation, that they could never do what THEY wanted to do. The baby began to scream and John Wesley kicked the back of the seat so hard that his father could feel the blows in his kidney.

""All right!"" he shouted and drew the car to a stop at the side of the road. ""Will you all shut up? Will you all just shut up for one second? If you don't shut up, we won't go anywhere.

""It would be very educational for them,"" the grandmother murmured.

""All right,"" Bailey said, ""but get this: this is the only time we're going to stop for anything like this. This is the one and only time.""

""The dirt road that you have to turn down is about a mile back,"" the grandmother directed. ""I marked it when we passed.""

""A dirt road,"" Bailey groaned.

After they had turned around and were headed toward the dirt road, the grandmother recalled other points about the house, the beautiful glass over the front doorway and the candle-lamp in the hall. John Wesley said that the secret panel was probably in the fireplace.

""You can't go inside this house,"" Bailey said. ""You don't know who lives there.""

""While you all talk to the people in front, I'll run around behind and get in a window,"" John Wesley suggested.

""We'll all stay in the car,"" his mother said. They turned onto the dirt road and the car raced roughly along in a swirl of pink dust. The grandmother recalled the times when there were no paved roads and thirty miles was a day's journey. The dirt road was hilly and there were sudden washes in it and sharp curves on dangerous embankments. All at once they would be on a hill, looking down over the blue tops of trees for miles around, then the next minute, they would be in a red depression with the dust-coated trees looking down on them.

""This place had better turn up in a minute,"" Bailey said, ""or I'm going to turn around.""

The road looked as if no one had traveled on it in months.

""It's not much farther,"" the grandmother said and just as she said it, a horrible thought came to her. The thought was so embarrassing that she turned red in the face and her eyes dilated and her feet jumped up, upsetting her valise in the corner. The instant the valise moved, the newspaper top she had over the basket under it rose with a snarl and Pitty Sing,the cat, sprang onto Bailey's shoulder.

The children were thrown to the floor and their mother, clutching the baby, was thrown out the door onto the ground; the old lady was thrown into the front seat. The car turned over once and landed right-side-up in a gulch off the side of the road. Bailey remained in the driver's seat with the cat-gray-striped with a broad white face and an orange nose-clinging to his neck like a caterpillar.

As soon as the children saw they could move their arms and legs, they scrambled out of the car, shouting, ""We've had an ACCIDENT!"" The grandmother was curled up under the

dashboard, hoping she was injured so that Bailey's wrath would not come down on her all at once. The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had remembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee.

Bailey removed the cat from his neck with both hands and flung it out the window against the side of a pine tree. Then he got out of the car and started looking for the children's mother. She was sitting against the side of the red gutted ditch, holding the screaming baby, but she only had a cut down her face and a broken shoulder. ""We've had an ACCIDENT!"" the children screamed in a frenzy of delight.

""But nobody's killed,"" June Star said with disappointment as the grandmother limped out of the car, her hat still pinned to her head but the broken front brim standing up at a jaunty angle and the violet spray hanging off the side. They all sat down in the ditch, except the children, to recover from the shock. They were all shaking.

""Maybe a car will come along,"" said the children's mother hoarsely.

""I believe I have injured an organ,"" said the grandmother, pressing her side, but no one answered her. Bailey's teeth were clattering. He had on a yellow sport shirt with bright blue parrots designed in it and his face was as yellow as the l shirt. The grandmother decided that she would not mention that the house was in Tennessee.

The road was about ten feet above and they could see only the tops of the trees on the other side of it. Behind the ditch they were sitting in there were more woods, tall and dark and deep. In a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as if the occupants were watching them. The grandmother stood up and waved both arms dramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared around a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over. It was a big black battered hearse-like automobile. There were three men in it.

It came to a stop just over them and for some minutes, the driver looked down with a steady expressionless gaze to where they were sitting, and didn't speak. Then he turned his

head and muttered something to the other two and they got out. One was a fat boy in black trousers and a red sweat shirt with a silver stallion embossed on the front of it. He moved around on the right side of them and stood staring, his mouth partly open in a kind of loose grin. The other had on khaki pants and a blue striped coat and a gray hat pulled down very low, hiding most of his face. He came around slowly on the left side. Neither spoke.

The driver got out of the car and stood by the side of it, looking down at them. He was an older man than the other two. His hair was just beginning to gray and he wore silver- rimmed spectacles that gave him a scholarly look. He had a long creased face and didn't have on any shirt or undershirt. He had on blue jeans that were too tight for him and was holding a black hat and a gun. The two boys also had guns.

""We've had an ACCIDENT!"" the children screamed.

The grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she knew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known him au her life but she could not recall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment, placing his feet carefully so that he wouldn't slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks, and his ankles were red and thin. ""Good afternoon,"" he said. ""I see you all had you a little spill.""

""We turned over twice!"" said the grandmother.

""Once"","" he corrected. ""We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram,"" he said quietly to the boy with the gray hat.

""What you got that gun for?"" John Wesley asked. ""Whatcha gonna do with that gun?""

""Lady,"" the man said to the children's mother, ""would you mind calling them children to sit down by you? Children make me nervous. I want all you all to sit down right together there where you're at.""

""What are you telling US what to do for?"" June Star asked.

Behind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. ""Come here,"" said their mother.

""Look here now,"" Bailey began suddenly, ""we're in a predicament! We're in . . .""

The grandmother shrieked. She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. ""You're The Misfit!"" she said. ""I recognized you at once!""

""Yes'm,"" the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be known, ""but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn't of reckernized me.""

Bailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the children. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened.

""Lady,"" he said, ""don't you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don't mean. I don't reckon he meant to talk to you thataway.""

""You wouldn't shoot a lady, would you?"" the grandmother said and removed a clean handkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.

The Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then covered it up again. ""I would hate to have to,"" he said.

""Listen,"" the grandmother almost screamed, ""I know you're a good man. You don't look a bit like you have com- mon blood. I know you must come from nice people!""

""Yes mam,"" he said, ""finest people in the world."" When he smiled he showed a row of strong white teeth. ""God never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy's heart was pure gold,"" he said. The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was standing with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. ""Watch them children, Bobby Lee,"" he said. ""You know they make me nervous."" He looked at the six of them huddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn't think of anything to say. ""Ain't a cloud in the sky,"" he remarked, looking up at it. ""Don't see no sun but don't see no cloud neither.""

""Yes, it's a beautiful day,"" said the grandmother. ""Listen,"" she said, ""you shouldn't call yourself The Misfit because I know you're a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell ""

""Hush!"" Bailey yelled. ""Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!"" He was squatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn't move.

""I prechate that, lady,"" The Misfit said and drew a little circle in the ground with the butt of his gun.

""It'll take a half a hour to fix this here car,"" Hiram called, looking over the raised hood of it.

""Well, first you and Bobby Lee get him and that little boy to step over yonder with you,"" The Misfit said, pointing to Bailey and John Wesley. ""The boys want to ast you some- thing,"" he said to Bailey. ""Would you mind stepping back in them woods there with them?""

""Listen,"" Bailey began, ""we're in a terrible predicament! Nobody realizes what this is,"" and his voice cracked. His eyes were as blue and intense as the parrots in his shirt and he remained perfectly still.

The grandmother reached up to adjust her hat brim as if she were going to the woods with him but it came off in her hand. She stood staring at it and after a second she let it fall on the ground. Hiram pulled Bailey up by the arm as if he were assisting an old man. John Wesley caught hold of his father's hand and Bobby Lee followed. They went off toward the woods and just as they reached the dark edge, Bailey turned and supporting himself against a gray naked pine trunk, he shouted, ""I'll be back in a minute, Mamma, wait on me!""

""Come back this instant!"" his mother shrilled but they all disappeared into the woods.

""Bailey Boy!"" the grandmother called in a tragic voice but she found she was looking at The Misfit squatting on the ground in front of her. ""I just know you're a good man,"" she said desperately. ""You're not a bit common!""

""Nome, I ain't a good man,"" The Misfit said after a second as if he had considered her statement carefully, ""but I ain't the worst in the world neither. My daddy said I was a different breed of dog from my brothers and sisters. 'You know,' Daddy said, 'it's some that can live their whole life out without asking about it and it's others has to know why it is, and this boy is one of the latters. He's going to be into every- thing!'"" He put on his black hat and looked up suddenly and then away deep into the woods as if he were embarrassed again. ""I'm sorry I don't have on a shirt before you ladies,"" he said, hunching his shoulders slightly. ""We buried our clothes that we had on when we escaped and we're just

making do until we can get better. We borrowed these from some folks we met,"" he explained.

""That's perfectly all right,"" the grandmother said. ""Maybe Bailey has an extra shirt in his suitcase.""

""I'll look and see terrectly,"" The Misfit said.

""Where are they taking him?"" the children's mother screamed.

""Daddy was a card himself,"" The Misfit said. ""You couldn't put anything over on him. He never got in trouble with the Authorities though. Just had the knack of handling them.""

""You could be honest too if you'd only try,"" said the grandmother. ""Think how wonderful it would be to settle down and live a comfortable life and not have to think about some- body chasing you all the time.""

The Misfit kept scratching in the ground with the butt of his gun as if he were thinking about it. ""Yes'm, somebody is always after you,"" he murmured.

The grandmother noticed how thin his shoulder blades were just behind-his hat because she was standing up looking down on him. ""Do you ever pray?"" she asked.

He shook his head. All she saw was the black hat wiggle between his shoulder blades. ""Nome,"" he said.

There was a pistol shot from the woods, followed closely by another. Then silence. The old lady's head jerked around. She could hear the wind move through the tree tops like a long satisfied insuck of breath. ""Bailey Boy!"" she called.

""I was a gospel singer for a while,"" The Misfit said. ""I been most everything. Been in the arm service, both land and sea, at home and abroad, been twict married, been an undertaker, been with the railroads, plowed Mother Earth, been in a tornado, seen a man burnt alive oncet,"" and he looked up at the children's mother and the little girl who were sitting close together, their faces white and their eyes glassy; ""I even seen a woman flogged,"" he said.

""Pray, pray,"" the grandmother began, ""pray, pray . . .""

""I never was a bad boy that I remember of,"" The Misfit said in an almost dreamy voice, ""but somewheres along the line I done something wrong and got sent to the penitentiary. I was buried alive,"" and he looked up and held her attention to him by a steady stare.

""That's when you should have started to pray,"" she said ""What did you do to get sent to the penitentiary that first time?""

""Turn to the right, it was a wall,"" The Misfit said, looking up again at the cloudless sky. ""Turn to the left, it was a wall. Look up it was a ceiling, look down it was a floor. I forget what I done, lady. I set there and set there, trying to remember what it was I done and I ain't recalled it to this day. Oncet in a while, I would think it was coming to me, but it never come.""

""Maybe they put you in by mistake,"" the old lady said vaguely.

""Nome,"" he said. ""It wasn't no mistake. They had the papers on me.""

""You must have stolen something,"" she said.

The Misfit sneered slightly. ""Nobody had nothing I wanted,"" he said. ""It was a head-doctor at the penitentiary said what I had done was kill my daddy but I known that for a lie. My daddy died in nineteen ought nineteen of the epidemic flu and I never had a thing to do with it. He was buried in the Mount Hopewell Baptist churchyard and you can go there and see for yourself.""

""If you would pray,"" the old lady said, ""Jesus would help you.""

""That's right,"" The Misfit said.

""Well then, why don't you pray?"" she asked trembling with delight suddenly.

""I don't want no hep,"" he said. ""I'm doing all right by myself.""

Bobby Lee and Hiram came ambling back from the woods. Bobby Lee was dragging a yellow shirt with bright blue parrots in it.

""Thow me that shirt, Bobby Lee,"" The Misfit said. The shirt came flying at him and landed on his shoulder and he put it on. The grandmother couldn't name what the shirt reminded her of. ""No, lady,"" The Misfit said while he was buttoning it up, ""I found out the crime don't matter. You can do one thing or you can do another, kill a man or take a tire off his car, because sooner or later you're going to forget what it was you done and just be punished for it.""

The children's mother had begun to make heaving noises as if she couldn't get her breath. ""Lady,"" he asked, ""would you and that little girl like to step off yonder with Bobby Lee and Hiram and join your husband?""

""Yes, thank you,"" the mother said faintly. Her left arm dangled helplessly and she was holding the baby, who had gone to sleep, in the other. ""Hep that lady up, Hiram,"" The Misfit said as she struggled to climb out of the ditch, ""and Bobby Lee, you hold onto that little girl's hand.""

""I don't want to hold hands with him,"" June Star said. ""He reminds me of a pig.""

The fat boy blushed and laughed and caught her by the arm and pulled her off into the woods after Hiram and her mother.

Alone with The Misfit, the grandmother found that she had lost her voice. There was not a cloud in the sky nor any sun. There was nothing around her but woods. She wanted to tell him that he must pray. She opened and closed her mouth several times before anything came out. Finally she found herself saying, ""Jesus. Jesus,"" meaning, Jesus will help you, but the way she was saying it, it sounded as if she might be cursing.

""Yes'm,"" The Misfit said as if he agreed. ""Jesus shown everything off balance. It was the same case with Him as with me except He hadn't committed any crime and they could prove I had committed one because they had the papers on me. Of course,"" he said, ""they never shown me my papers. That's why I sign myself now. I said long ago, you get you a signature and sign everything you do and keep a copy of it. Then you'll know what you done and you can hold up the crime to the punishment and see do they match and in the end you'll have something to prove you ain't been treated right. I call myself The Misfit,"" he said, ""because I can't make what all I done wrong fit what all I gone through in punishment.""

There was a piercing scream from the woods, followed closely by a pistol report. ""Does it seem right to you, lady, that one is punished a heap and another ain't punished at all?""

""Jesus!"" the old lady cried. ""You've got good blood! I know you wouldn't shoot a lady! I know you come from nice people! Pray! Jesus, you ought not to shoot a lady. I'll give you all the money I've got!""

""Lady,"" The Misfit said, looking beyond her far into the woods, ""there never was a body that give the undertaker a tip.""

There were two more pistol reports and the grandmother raised her head like a parched old turkey hen crying for water and called, ""Bailey Boy, Bailey Boy!"" as if her heart would break.

""Jesus was the only One that ever raised the dead,"" The Misfit continued, ""and He shouldn't have done it. He shown everything off balance. If He did what He said, then it's nothing for you to do but thow away everything and follow Him, and if He didn't, then it's nothing for you to do but enjoy the few minutes you got left the best way you can-by killing somebody or burning down his house or doing some other meanness to him. No pleasure but meanness,"" he said and his voice had become almost a snarl.

""Maybe He didn't raise the dead,"" the old lady mumbled, not knowing what she was saying and feeling so dizzy that she sank down in the ditch with her legs twisted under her.

""I wasn't there so I can't say He didn't,"" The Misfit said. ""I wisht I had of been there,"" he said, hitting the ground with his fist. ""It ain't right I wasn't there because if I had of been there I would of known. Listen lady,"" he said in a high voice, ""if I had of been there I would of known and I wouldn't be like I am now."" His voice seemed about to crack and the grandmother's head cleared for an instant. She saw the man's face twisted close to her own as if he were going to cry and she murmured, ""Why you're one of my babies. You're one of my own children!"" She reached out and touched him on the shoulder. The Misfit sprang back as if a snake had bitten him and shot her three times through the chest. Then he put his gun down on the ground and took off his glasses and began to clean them.

Hiram and Bobby Lee returned from the woods and stood over the ditch, looking down at the grandmother who half sat and half lay in a puddle of blood with her legs crossed under her like a child's and her face smiling up at the cloudless sky.

Without his glasses, The Misfit's eyes were red-rimmed and pale and defenseless-looking. ""Take her off and thow her where you shown the others,"" he said, picking up the cat that was rubbing itself against his leg.

""She was a talker, wasn't she?"" Bobby Lee said, sliding down the ditch with a yodel.

""She would of been a good woman,"" The Misfit said, ""if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life.""

""Some fun!"" Bobby Lee said.

""Shut up, Bobby Lee"" The Misfit said. ""It's no real pleasure in life.""","The story begins with the grandmother trying to convince her son, Bailey, to change their plans and go to Tennessee instead of Florida. She argues that they should visit different places and be more open-minded. The children, John Wesley and June Star, mock the grandmother's desire for adventure. The grandmother then reads an article about an escaped criminal, The Misfit, who is on the loose in Florida. She warns Bailey that it is unsafe to go there with the criminal on the loose.

The family sets off on their trip to Florida, with the grandmother secretly bringing along her cat, Pitty Sing, in a basket. Along the way, they stop at a roadside restaurant called The Tower. The grandmother engages in conversation with Red Sammy Butts, the owner of the restaurant, about how people are not as trustworthy as they used to be. They discuss the criminal, The Misfit, and the grandmother expresses her fear that he might come to the restaurant.

Continuing their journey, the family gets into a car accident after the grandmother realizes that the plantation house she had visited in her youth is actually in Tennessee and not in Georgia. The car overturns in a ditch, and they wait for help to arrive. Suddenly, a hearse-like car pulls up with three men inside, including The Misfit.

The Misfit and his companions take control of the situation, and the grandmother recognizes The Misfit as the escaped criminal. She tries to convince him that he is a good man and shouldn't harm her. The Misfit engages in a philosophical conversation with the grandmother about the nature of good and evil. Meanwhile, the rest of the family is taken into the woods by The Misfit's companions and shot one by one.

The grandmother, still desperately trying to save herself, tells The Misfit that he is one of her own children. However, he shoots her three times in the chest. The story ends with The Misfit commenting on the emptiness and meaninglessness of life, while his companions dispose of the grandmother's body.","The story begins with the grandmother trying to convince her son Bailey not to take their family to Florida and instead go to East Tennessee to visit her connections. She is concerned about a criminal called The Misfit, who has escaped from the Federal Pen and is heading towards Florida. The grandmother warns Bailey about the dangers of traveling with a criminal on the loose but he ignores her. The grandmother continues to suggest going to Tennessee instead, but the rest of the family is uninterested. The children taunt the grandmother, saying she wouldn't stay home even if she were paid a million dollars and that she has to go everywhere they go.

The next morning, the grandmother is eager to leave for the trip. She brings along her cat, Pitty Sing, secretly hidden in a basket. As they drive, the grandmother tells Bailey about interesting sights along the way, such as Stone Mountain and various crops. The children are bored and uninterested. They make fun of Georgia and Tennessee, which upsets the grandmother. They stop at a gas station called The Tower, where the grandmother tries to engage with the owner, Red Sammy Butts. Red Sammy talks about how people have become untrustworthy and tells a story about two men who stole from him. The grandmother brings up The Misfit again, and Red Sammy predicts that he might even come to their place if he hears about the money in the cash register.

As they continue driving, the grandmother talks about an old plantation house she visited in Tennessee and suggests they go see it. Bailey refuses, but the grandmother insists that they turn off onto a dirt road to find it. However, she suddenly realizes that the plantation house is actually in Tennessee, not Georgia. They have an accident, flipping the car. The grandmother realizes that The Misfit is actually one of the three men who approach them. The Misfit and his two companions, Hiram and Bobby Lee, plan to kill them all.

The grandmother tries to reason with The Misfit, saying that she recognizes him as a good man and that he must come from nice people. The Misfit and the grandmother discuss their views on punishment and religion. The grandmother tells The Misfit he should pray and that Jesus will help him, but The Misfit dismisses the idea. The children's mother and her daughter are taken into the woods by Hiram and Bobby Lee and killed. The Misfit, his hands shaking, shoots the grandmother three times in the chest. The story ends with The Misfit contemplating the meaning of life while Bobby Lee mocks the situation.",s55
Araby,James Joyce,"North Richmond Street, being blind, was a quiet street except at the hour when the Christian Brothers' School set the boys free. An uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces.
The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back drawing-room. Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all the rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers. Among these I found a few paper-covered books, the pages of which were curled and damp: The Abbot, by Walter Scott, The Devout Communicant, and The Memoirs of Vidocq. I liked the last best because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house contained a central apple-tree and a few straggling bushes, under one of which I found the late tenant's rusty bicycle-pump. He had been a very charitable priest; in his will he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of his house to his sister.
When the short days of winter came, dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinners. When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the silent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses, where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness. When we returned to the street, light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner, we hid in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan's sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea, we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan's steps resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her before he obeyed, and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body, and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side.
Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood.
Her image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance. On Saturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I had to go to carry some of the parcels. We walked through the flaring streets, jostled by drunken men and bargaining women, amid the curses of labourers, the shrill litanies of shop-boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs' cheeks, the nasal chanting of street-singers, who sang a come-all-you about O'Donovan Rossa, or a ballad about the troubles in our native land. These noises converged in a single sensation of life for me: I imagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes. Her name sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and praises which I myself did not understand. My eyes were often full of tears I could not tell why and at times a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out into my bosom. I thought little of the future. I did not know whether I would ever speak to her or not or, if I spoke to her, how I could tell her of my confused adoration. But my body was like a harp and her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the wires.
One evening I went into the back drawing-room in which the priest had died. It was a dark rainy evening and there was no sound in the house. Through one of the broken panes I heard the rain impinge upon the earth, the fine incessant needles of water playing in the sodden beds. Some distant lamp or lighted window gleamed below me. I was thankful that I could see so little. All my senses seemed to desire to veil themselves and, feeling that I was about to slip from them, I pressed the palms of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: 'O love! O love!' many times.
At last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me was I going to Araby. I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It would be a splendid bazaar; she said she would love to go.
'And why can't you?' I asked.
While she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist. She could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week in her convent. Her brother and two other boys were fighting for their caps, and I was alone at the railings. She held one of the spikes, bowing her head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one side of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible as she stood at ease.
'It's well for you,' she said.
'If I go,' I said, 'I will bring you something.'
What innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts after that evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening days. I chafed against the work of school. At night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came between me and the page I strove to read. The syllables of the word Araby were called to me through the silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment over me. I asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night. My aunt was surprised, and hoped it was not some Freemason affair. I answered few questions in class. I watched my master's face pass from amiability to sternness; he hoped I was not beginning to idle. I could not call my wandering thoughts together. I had hardly any patience with the serious work of life which, now that it stood between me and my desire, seemed to me child's play, ugly monotonous child's play.
On Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to the bazaar in the evening. He was fussing at the hallstand, looking for the hat-brush, and answered me curtly:
'Yes, boy, I know.'
As he was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour and lie at the window. I felt the house in bad humour and walked slowly towards the school. The air was pitilessly raw and already my heart misgave me.
When I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home. Still it was early. I sat staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking began to irritate me, I left the room. I mounted the staircase and gained the upper part of the house. The high, cold, empty, gloomy rooms liberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front window I saw my companions playing below in the street. Their cries reached me weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the cool glass, I looked over at the dark house where she lived. I may have stood there for an hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress.
When I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at the fire. She was an old, garrulous woman, a pawnbroker's widow, who collected used stamps for some pious purpose. I had to endure the gossip of the tea-table. The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come. Mrs Mercer stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn't wait any longer, but it was after eight o'clock and she did not like to be out late, as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone I began to walk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said:
'I'm afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord.'
At nine o'clock I heard my uncle's latchkey in the hall door. I heard him talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had received the weight of his overcoat. I could interpret these signs. When he was midway through his dinner I asked him to give me the money to go to the bazaar. He had forgotten.
'The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,' he said.
I did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically:
'Can't you give him the money and let him go? You've kept him late enough as it is.'
My uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he believed in the old saying: 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.' He asked me where I was going and, when I told him a second time, he asked me did I know The Arab's Farewell to his Steed. When I left the kitchen he was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt.
I held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street towards the station. The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled to me the purpose of my journey. I took my seat in a third-class carriage of a deserted train. After an intolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly. It crept onward among ruinous houses and over the twinkling river. At Westland Row Station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors; but the porters moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the bazaar. I remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the train drew up beside an improvised wooden platform. I passed out on to the road and saw by the lighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me was a large building which displayed the magical name.
I could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the bazaar would be closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile, handing a shilling to a weary-looking man. I found myself in a big hall girded at half its height by a gallery. Nearly all the stalls were closed and the greater part of the hall was in darkness. I recognized a silence like that which pervades a church after a service. I walked into the centre of the bazaar timidly. A few people were gathered about the stalls which were still open. Before a curtain, over which the words Café Chantant were written in coloured lamps, two men were counting money on a salver. I listened to the fall of the coins.
Remembering with difficulty why I had come, I went over to one of the stalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered tea-sets. At the door of the stall a young lady was talking and laughing with two young gentlemen. I remarked their English accents and listened vaguely to their conversation.
'O, I never said such a thing!'
'O, but you did!'
'O, but I didn't!'
'Didn't she say that?'
'Yes. I heard her.'
'O, there's a. . . fib!'
Observing me, the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy anything. The tone of her voice was not encouraging; she seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense of duty. I looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern guards at either side of the dark entrance to the stall and murmured:
'No, thank you.'
The young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to the two young men. They began to talk of the same subject. Once or twice the young lady glanced at me over her shoulder.
I lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make my interest in her wares seem the more real. Then I turned away slowly and walked down the middle of the bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to fall against the sixpence in my pocket. I heard a voice call from one end of the gallery that the light was out. The upper part of the hall was now completely dark.
Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.","In the story, the narrator describes the setting of North Richmond Street, a quiet and detached street where he lives. He mentions the former tenant, a charitable priest who died in the house, leaving his belongings to his sister. The narrator describes his infatuation with Mangan's sister, a girl who lives on the same street. He watches her every day, follows her, and even imagines her in his prayers and daydreams. The narrator becomes obsessed with the idea of going to the Araby bazaar and bringing back a gift for Mangan's sister. He asks his uncle for money to go to the bazaar, but his uncle forgets. Eventually, the narrator is able to go to the bazaar but arrives late, finding most of the stalls closed and the hall in darkness. He realizes that his infatuation and pursuit of the bazaar were driven by vanity and is left feeling anguished and angry. The story explores themes of unrequited love, disillusionment, and the loss of innocence. The character of the narrator undergoes a transformation from infatuation and obsession to disappointment and disillusionment.","The story is set on North Richmond Street, a quiet street where the Christian Brothers' School is located. The narrator describes an uninhabited house at the end of the street and the other houses that surround it, all with brown imperturbable faces.

The narrator then recounts finding some old books in the house, including The Abbot, The Devout Communicant, and The Memoirs of Vidocq. The narrator particularly likes The Memoirs of Vidocq because its pages are yellow. The previous tenant, a priest, had died in the house and left his money to institutions and his furniture to his sister.

The story moves on to describe the short days of winter, when dusk falls early and the street becomes sombre. The narrator and his friends play outside, running through dark muddy lanes and encountering rough tribes from the cottages. They also observe Mangan's sister, a girl the narrator is infatuated with, when she comes out on the doorstep. The narrator watches her and thinks of her constantly, even in places that are hostile to romance.

One evening, the narrator goes into the back drawing-room of the house and experiences a moment of intense longing and desire. He murmurs words of love to himself.

Finally, Mangan's sister speaks to the narrator, asking if he is going to Araby, a bazaar that she would love to go to but can't because of a retreat in her convent. The narrator promises to bring her something if he goes.

The narrator becomes consumed with thoughts of the bazaar, fantasizing about it and eagerly anticipating the event. He asks his uncle for money to go to the bazaar and reminds him multiple times. However, his uncle forgets and the narrator becomes increasingly anxious as the evening goes on.

When his uncle finally remembers, it is too late, and the narrator rushes to the train station to catch a train to the bazaar. He arrives at the bazaar, which is mostly closed and dark. The young lady at one of the stalls shows little interest in him, and he leaves the bazaar feeling utterly disappointed.

In the end, the narrator is filled with anguish and anger, realizing that his infatuation and desire for the bazaar were driven by vanity.",s56
Bellflower,Guy de Maupassant,"How strange are those old recollections which haunt us without our being able to get rid of them! This one is so very old that I cannot understand how it has clung so vividly and tenaciously to my memory. Since then I have seen so many sinister things, either affecting or terrible, that I am astonished at not being able to pass a single day without the face of Mother Bellflower recurring to my mind's eye, just as I knew her formerly long, long ago, when I was ten or twelve years old.
She was an old seamstress who came to my parents' house once a week, every Thursday, to mend the linen. My parents lived in one of those country houses called chateaux, which are merely old houses with pointed roofs, to which are attached three or four adjacent farms.
The village, a large village, almost a small market town, was a few hundred yards off and nestled round the church, a red brick church, which had become black with age.
Well, every Thursday Mother Bellflower came between half-past six and seven in the morning and went immediately into the linen room and began to work. She was a tall, thin, bearded or rather hairy woman, for she had a beard all over her face, a surprising, an unexpected beard, growing in improbable tufts, in curly bunches which looked as if they had been sown by a madman over that great face, the face of a gendarme in petticoats. She had them on her nose, under her nose, round her nose, on her chin, on her cheeks, and her eyebrows, which were extraordinarily thick and long and quite gray, bushy and bristling, looked exactly like a pair of mustaches stuck on there by mistake.
She limped, not like lame people generally do, but like a ship pitching. When she planted her great bony, vibrant body on her sound leg, she seemed to be preparing to mount some enormous wave, and then suddenly she dipped as if to disappear in an abyss and buried herself in the ground. Her walk reminded one of a ship in a storm, and her head, which was always covered with an enormous white cap, whose ribbons fluttered down her back, seemed to traverse the horizon from north to south and from south to north at each limp.
I adored Mother Bellflower. As soon as I was up I used to go into the linen room, where I found her installed at work with a foot warmer under her feet. As soon as I arrived she made me take the foot warmer and sit upon it, so that I might not catch cold in that large chilly room under the roof.
""That draws the blood from your head,"" she would say to me.
She told me stories while mending the linen with her long, crooked, nimble fingers; behind her magnifying spectacles, for age had impaired her sight, her eyes appeared enormous to me, strangely profound, double.
As far as I can remember from the things which she told me and by which my childish heart was moved, she had the large heart of a poor woman. She told me what had happened in the village, how a cow had escaped from the cow house and had been found the next morning in front of Prosper Malet's mill looking at the sails turning, or about a hen's egg which had been found in the church belfry without anyone being able to understand what creature had been there to lay it, or the queer story of Jean Pila's dog who had gone ten leagues to bring back his master's breeches which a tramp had stolen while they were hanging up to dry out of doors after he had been caught in the rain. She told me these simple adventures in such a manner that in my mind they assumed the proportions of never-to-be-forgotten dramas, of grand and mysterious poems; and the ingenious stories invented by the poets, which my mother told me in the evening, had none of the flavor, none of the fullness or of the vigor of the peasant woman's narratives.
Well, one Thursday when I had spent all the morning in listening to Mother Clochette, I wanted to go upstairs to her again during the day after picking hazelnuts with the manservant in the wood behind the farm. I remember it all as clearly as what happened only yesterday.
On opening the door of the linen room I saw the old seamstress lying on the floor by the side of her chair, her face turned down and her arms stretched out, but still holding her needle in one hand and one of my shirts in the other. One of her legs in a blue stocking, the longer one no doubt, was extended under her chair, and her spectacles glistened by the wall, where they had rolled away from her.
I ran away uttering shrill cries. They all came running, and in a few minutes I was told that Mother Clochette was dead.
I cannot describe the profound, poignant, terrible emotion which stirred my childish heart. I went slowly down into the drawing room and hid myself in a dark corner in the depths of a great old armchair, where I knelt and wept. I remained there for a long time, no doubt, for night came on. Suddenly someone came in with a lamp--without seeing me, however--and heard my father and mother talking with the medical man, whose voice recognized.
He had been sent for immediately, and he was explaining the cause of the accident, of which I understood nothing, however. Then he sat down and had a glass of liqueur and a biscuit.
He went on talking, and what he then said will remain engraved on my mind until I die. I think that I can give the exact words which he used.
""Ah!"" he said. ""The poor woman! she broke her leg the day of my arrival here. I had not even had time to wash my hands after getting off the diligence before I was sent for in all haste, for it was a bad case, very bad.
""She was seventeen and a pretty girl, very pretty! Would anyone believe it? I have never told her story before; in fact, no one but myself and one other person, who is no longer living in this part of the country, ever knew it. Now that she is dead I may be less discreet.
""A young assistant teacher had just come to live in the village; he was good looking and had the bearing of a soldier. All the girls ran after him, but he was disdainful. Besides that, he was very much afraid of his superior, the schoolmaster, old Grabu, who occasionally got out of bed the wrong foot first.
""Old Grabu already employed pretty Hortense, who has just died here and who was afterward nicknamed Clochette. The assistant master singled out the pretty young girl who was no doubt flattered at being chosen by this disdainful conqueror; at any rate, she fell in love with him, and he succeeded in persuading her to give him a first meeting in the hayloft behind the school at night after she had done her day's sewing.
""She pretended to go home, but instead of going downstairs when she left the Grabus', she went upstairs and hid among the hay to wait for her lover. He soon joined her, and he was beginning to say pretty things to her, when the door of the hayloft opened and the schoolmaster appeared and asked: 'What are you doing up there, Sigisbert?' Feeling sure that he would be caught, the young schoolmaster lost his presence of mind and replied stupidly: 'I came up here to rest a little among the bundles of hay, Monsieur Grabu.'
""The loft was very large and absolutely dark. Sigisbert pushed the frightened girl to the farther end and said: 'Go, there and hide yourself. I shall lose my situation, so get away and hide yourself.'
""When the schoolmaster heard the whispering he continued: 'Why, you are not by yourself.'
""'Yes, I am, Monsieur Grabu!'
""'But you are not, for you are talking.'
""'I swear I am, Monsieur Grabu.'
""'I will soon find out,' the old man replied and, double-locking the door, he went down to get a light.
""Then the young man, who was a coward such as one sometimes meets, lost his head, and he repeated, having grown furious all of a sudden: 'Hide yourself, so that he may not find you. You will deprive me of my bread for my whole life; you will ruin my whole career! Do hide yourself!'
""They could hear the key turning in the lock again, and Hortense ran to the window which looked out onto the street, opened it quickly and then in a low and determined voice said: 'You will come and pick me up when he is gone,' and she jumped out.
""Old Grabu found nobody and went down again in great surprise! A quarter of an hour later Monsieur Sigisbert came to me and related his adventure. The girl had remained at the foot of the wall, unable to get up, as she had fallen from the second story, and I went with him to fetch her. It was raining in torrents, and I brought the unfortunate girl home with me, for the right leg was broken in three places, and the bones had come out through the flesh. She did not complain and merely said with admirable resignation: 'I am punished, well punished!'
""I sent for assistance and for the workgirl's friends and told them a made-up story of a runaway carriage which had knocked her down and lamed her outside my door. They believed me, and the gendarmes for a whole month tried in vain to find the author of this accident.
""That is all! Now I say that this woman was a heroine and had the fiber of those who accomplish the grandest deeds in history.
""That was her only love affair, and she died a virgin. She was a martyr, a noble soul, a sublimely devoted woman! And if I did not absolutely admire her I should not have told you this story, which I would never tell anyone during her life; you understand why.""
The doctor ceased; Mamma cried, and Papa said some words which I did not catch; then they left the room, and I remained on my knees in the armchair and sobbed, while I heard a strange noise of heavy footsteps and something knocking against the side of the staircase.
They were carrying away Clochette's body.","The narrator recalls their childhood memories of Mother Bellflower, an old seamstress who would come to their parents' house every Thursday to mend the linen. Mother Bellflower was a tall, thin woman with a beard all over her face and a peculiar walk that resembled a ship in a storm. Despite her appearance, the narrator adored her and would often spend time with her in the linen room, listening to her stories and sitting on a foot warmer to keep warm.

One Thursday, when the narrator went to visit Mother Bellflower after picking hazelnuts, they found her lying on the floor, motionless. It is revealed that Mother Bellflower had broken her leg on the day the doctor arrived in the village years ago. The doctor explains that Mother Bellflower, then known as Hortense, had fallen in love with a young assistant teacher named Sigisbert. They had planned to meet in the hayloft behind the school, but were interrupted by the schoolmaster. In a panic, Sigisbert urged Hortense to hide, but she jumped out of the window instead, breaking her leg in the fall. The doctor had helped her and lied to everyone about the cause of her injury.

The doctor praises Mother Bellflower's courage and selflessness, calling her a heroine and a noble soul. The narrator is deeply moved by the doctor's story and remains in the armchair, sobbing, as they hear the sound of Mother Bellflower's body being carried away.

The story explores the strange and vivid memories that remain with the narrator, particularly the impact of Mother Bellflower's tragic past and her selfless sacrifice.

The Bet,Anton Pavlovich Chekhov,"I
It was a dark autumn night. The old banker was walking up and down his study and remembering how, fifteen years before, he had given a party one autumn evening. There had been many clever men there, and there had been interesting conversations. Among other things they had talked of capital punishment. The majority of the guests, among whom were many journalists and intellectual men, disapproved of the death penalty. They considered that form of punishment out of date, immoral, and unsuitable for Christian States. In the opinion of some of them the death penalty ought to be replaced everywhere by imprisonment for life.
""I don't agree with you,"" said their host the banker. ""I have not tried either the death penalty or imprisonment for life, but if one may judge _a priori_, the death penalty is more moral and more humane than imprisonment for life. Capital punishment kills a man at once, but lifelong imprisonment kills him slowly. Which executioner is the more humane, he who kills you in a few minutes or he who drags the life out of you in the course of many years?""
""Both are equally immoral,"" observed one of the guests, ""for they both have the same object -- to take away life. The State is not God. It has not the right to take away what it cannot restore when it wants to.""
Among the guests was a young lawyer, a young man of five-and-twenty. When he was asked his opinion, he said:
""The death sentence and the life sentence are equally immoral, but if I had to choose between the death penalty and imprisonment for life, I would certainly choose the second. To live anyhow is better than not at all.""
A lively discussion arose. The banker, who was younger and more nervous in those days, was suddenly carried away by excitement; he struck the table with his fist and shouted at the young man:
""It's not true! I'll bet you two millions you wouldn't stay in solitary confinement for five years.""
""If you mean that in earnest,"" said the young man, ""I'll take the bet, but I would stay not five but fifteen years.""
""Fifteen? Done!"" cried the banker. ""Gentlemen, I stake two millions!""
""Agreed! You stake your millions and I stake my freedom!"" said the young man.
And this wild, senseless bet was carried out! The banker, spoilt and frivolous, with millions beyond his reckoning, was delighted at the bet. At supper he made fun of the young man, and said:
""Think better of it, young man, while there is still time. To me two millions are a trifle, but you are losing three or four of the best years of your life. I say three or four, because you won't stay longer. Don't forget either, you unhappy man, that voluntary confinement is a great deal harder to bear than compulsory. The thought that you have the right to step out in liberty at any moment will poison your whole existence in prison. I am sorry for you.""
And now the banker, walking to and fro, remembered all this, and asked himself: ""What was the object of that bet? What is the good of that man's losing fifteen years of his life and my throwing away two millions? Can it prove that the death penalty is better or worse than imprisonment for life? No, no. It was all nonsensical and meaningless. On my part it was the caprice of a pampered man, and on his part simple greed for money. . . .""
Then he remembered what followed that evening. It was decided that the young man should spend the years of his captivity under the strictest supervision in one of the lodges in the banker's garden. It was agreed that for fifteen years he should not be free to cross the threshold of the lodge, to see human beings, to hear the human voice, or to receive letters and newspapers. He was allowed to have a musical instrument and books, and was allowed to write letters, to drink wine, and to smoke. By the terms of the agreement, the only relations he could have with the outer world were by a little window made purposely for that object. He might have anything he wanted -- books, music, wine, and so on -- in any quantity he desired by writing an order, but could only receive them through the window. The agreement provided for every detail and every trifle that would make his imprisonment strictly solitary, and bound the young man to stay there _exactly_ fifteen years, beginning from twelve o'clock of November 14, 1870, and ending at twelve o'clock of November 14, 1885. The slightest attempt on his part to break the conditions, if only two minutes before the end, released the banker from the obligation to pay him two millions.
For the first year of his confinement, as far as one could judge from his brief notes, the prisoner suffered severely from loneliness and depression. The sounds of the piano could be heard continually day and night from his lodge. He refused wine and tobacco. Wine, he wrote, excites the desires, and desires are the worst foes of the prisoner; and besides, nothing could be more dreary than drinking good wine and seeing no one. And tobacco spoilt the air of his room. In the first year the books he sent for were principally of a light character; novels with a complicated love plot, sensational and fantastic stories, and so on.
In the second year the piano was silent in the lodge, and the prisoner asked only for the classics. In the fifth year music was audible again, and the prisoner asked for wine. Those who watched him through the window said that all that year he spent doing nothing but eating and drinking and lying on his bed, frequently yawning and angrily talking to himself. He did not read books. Sometimes at night he would sit down to write; he would spend hours writing, and in the morning tear up all that he had written. More than once he could be heard crying.
In the second half of the sixth year the prisoner began zealously studying languages, philosophy, and history. He threw himself eagerly into these studies -- so much so that the banker had enough to do to get him the books he ordered. In the course of four years some six hundred volumes were procured at his request. It was during this period that the banker received the following letter from his prisoner:
""My dear Jailer, I write you these lines in six languages. Show them to people who know the languages. Let them read them. If they find not one mistake I implore you to fire a shot in the garden. That shot will show me that my efforts have not been thrown away. The geniuses of all ages and of all lands speak different languages, but the same flame burns in them all. Oh, if you only knew what unearthly happiness my soul feels now from being able to understand them!"" The prisoner's desire was fulfilled. The banker ordered two shots to be fired in the garden.
Then after the tenth year, the prisoner sat immovably at the table and read nothing but the Gospel. It seemed strange to the banker that a man who in four years had mastered six hundred learned volumes should waste nearly a year over one thin book easy of comprehension. Theology and histories of religion followed the Gospels.
In the last two years of his confinement the prisoner read an immense quantity of books quite indiscriminately. At one time he was busy with the natural sciences, then he would ask for Byron or Shakespeare. There were notes in which he demanded at the same time books on chemistry, and a manual of medicine, and a novel, and some treatise on philosophy or theology. His reading suggested a man swimming in the sea among the wreckage of his ship, and trying to save his life by greedily clutching first at one spar and then at another.
II
The old banker remembered all this, and thought:
""To-morrow at twelve o'clock he will regain his freedom. By our agreement I ought to pay him two millions. If I do pay him, it is all over with me: I shall be utterly ruined.""
Fifteen years before, his millions had been beyond his reckoning; now he was afraid to ask himself which were greater, his debts or his assets. Desperate gambling on the Stock Exchange, wild speculation and the excitability which he could not get over even in advancing years, had by degrees led to the decline of his fortune and the proud, fearless, self-confident millionaire had become a banker of middling rank, trembling at every rise and fall in his investments. ""Cursed bet!"" muttered the old man, clutching his head in despair ""Why didn't the man die? He is only forty now. He will take my last penny from me, he will marry, will enjoy life, will gamble on the Exchange; while I shall look at him with envy like a beggar, and hear from him every day the same sentence: 'I am indebted to you for the happiness of my life, let me help you!' No, it is too much! The one means of being saved from bankruptcy and disgrace is the death of that man!""
It struck three o'clock, the banker listened; everyone was asleep in the house and nothing could be heard outside but the rustling of the chilled trees. Trying to make no noise, he took from a fireproof safe the key of the door which had not been opened for fifteen years, put on his overcoat, and went out of the house.
It was dark and cold in the garden. Rain was falling. A damp cutting wind was racing about the garden, howling and giving the trees no rest. The banker strained his eyes, but could see neither the earth nor the white statues, nor the lodge, nor the trees. Going to the spot where the lodge stood, he twice called the watchman. No answer followed. Evidently the watchman had sought shelter from the weather, and was now asleep somewhere either in the kitchen or in the greenhouse.
""If I had the pluck to carry out my intention,"" thought the old man, ""Suspicion would fall first upon the watchman.""
He felt in the darkness for the steps and the door, and went into the entry of the lodge. Then he groped his way into a little passage and lighted a match. There was not a soul there. There was a bedstead with no bedding on it, and in the corner there was a dark cast-iron stove. The seals on the door leading to the prisoner's rooms were intact.
When the match went out the old man, trembling with emotion, peeped through the little window. A candle was burning dimly in the prisoner's room. He was sitting at the table. Nothing could be seen but his back, the hair on his head, and his hands. Open books were lying on the table, on the two easy-chairs, and on the carpet near the table.
Five minutes passed and the prisoner did not once stir. Fifteen years' imprisonment had taught him to sit still. The banker tapped at the window with his finger, and the prisoner made no movement whatever in response. Then the banker cautiously broke the seals off the door and put the key in the keyhole. The rusty lock gave a grating sound and the door creaked. The banker expected to hear at once footsteps and a cry of astonishment, but three minutes passed and it was as quiet as ever in the room. He made up his mind to go in.
At the table a man unlike ordinary people was sitting motionless. He was a skeleton with the skin drawn tight over his bones, with long curls like a woman's and a shaggy beard. His face was yellow with an earthy tint in it, his cheeks were hollow, his back long and narrow, and the hand on which his shaggy head was propped was so thin and delicate that it was dreadful to look at it. His hair was already streaked with silver, and seeing his emaciated, aged-looking face, no one would have believed that he was only forty. He was asleep. . . . In front of his bowed head there lay on the table a sheet of paper on which there was something written in fine handwriting.
""Poor creature!"" thought the banker, ""he is asleep and most likely dreaming of the millions. And I have only to take this half-dead man, throw him on the bed, stifle him a little with the pillow, and the most conscientious expert would find no sign of a violent death. But let us first read what he has written here. . . .""
The banker took the page from the table and read as follows:
""To-morrow at twelve o'clock I regain my freedom and the right to associate with other men, but before I leave this room and see the sunshine, I think it necessary to say a few words to you. With a clear conscience I tell you, as before God, who beholds me, that I despise freedom and life and health, and all that in your books is called the good things of the world.
""For fifteen years I have been intently studying earthly life. It is true I have not seen the earth nor men, but in your books I have drunk fragrant wine, I have sung songs, I have hunted stags and wild boars in the forests, have loved women. . . . Beauties as ethereal as clouds, created by the magic of your poets and geniuses, have visited me at night, and have whispered in my ears wonderful tales that have set my brain in a whirl. In your books I have climbed to the peaks of Elburz and Mont Blanc, and from there I have seen the sun rise and have watched it at evening flood the sky, the ocean, and the mountain-tops with gold and crimson. I have watched from there the lightning flashing over my head and cleaving the storm-clouds. I have seen green forests, fields, rivers, lakes, towns. I have heard the singing of the sirens, and the strains of the shepherds' pipes; I have touched the wings of comely devils who flew down to converse with me of God. . . . In your books I have flung myself into the bottomless pit, performed miracles, slain, burned towns, preached new religions, conquered whole kingdoms. . . .
""Your books have given me wisdom. All that the unresting thought of man has created in the ages is compressed into a small compass in my brain. I know that I am wiser than all of you.
""And I despise your books, I despise wisdom and the blessings of this world. It is all worthless, fleeting, illusory, and deceptive, like a mirage. You may be proud, wise, and fine, but death will wipe you off the face of the earth as though you were no more than mice burrowing under the floor, and your posterity, your history, your immortal geniuses will burn or freeze together with the earthly globe.
""You have lost your reason and taken the wrong path. You have taken lies for truth, and hideousness for beauty. You would marvel if, owing to strange events of some sorts, frogs and lizards suddenly grew on apple and orange trees instead of fruit, or if roses began to smell like a sweating horse; so I marvel at you who exchange heaven for earth. I don't want to understand you.
""To prove to you in action how I despise all that you live by, I renounce the two millions of which I once dreamed as of paradise and which now I despise. To deprive myself of the right to the money I shall go out from here five hours before the time fixed, and so break the compact. . . .""
When the banker had read this he laid the page on the table, kissed the strange man on the head, and went out of the lodge, weeping. At no other time, even when he had lost heavily on the Stock Exchange, had he felt so great a contempt for himself. When he got home he lay on his bed, but his tears and emotion kept him for hours from sleeping.
Next morning the watchmen ran in with pale faces, and told him they had seen the man who lived in the lodge climb out of the window into the garden, go to the gate, and disappear. The banker went at once with the servants to the lodge and made sure of the flight of his prisoner. To avoid arousing unnecessary talk, he took from the table the writing in which the millions were renounced, and when he got home locked it up in the fireproof safe.","The story begins with a discussion among a group of intellectuals and journalists about capital punishment. The banker argues that the death penalty is more moral and humane than lifelong imprisonment, while a young lawyer disagrees and believes that life, no matter how difficult, is better than death. The banker impulsively bets the young lawyer two million rubles that he cannot stay in solitary confinement for fifteen years. The young man accepts the bet and is confined to a lodge in the banker's garden.

For the first year, the prisoner suffers from loneliness and depression. He refuses wine and tobacco, and his requests for books are light novels. In the second year, he only asks for classical books and the piano in his lodge falls silent. In the fifth year, he starts asking for wine again and spends his time eating, drinking, and lying in bed. He stops reading books and occasionally cries. In the sixth year, he becomes eager to study languages, philosophy, and history, and requests hundreds of books.

After ten years, the prisoner becomes fixated on reading the Gospel. In the last two years of his confinement, he reads various books indiscriminately. The banker, now in financial ruin due to gambling, realizes that if he pays the two million rubles he will be completely ruined. He contemplates killing the prisoner to avoid paying him.

On the day before the prisoner's release, the banker goes to the lodge and finds the prisoner sitting motionless at a table. The prisoner looks like a skeleton with long hair and a shaggy beard. The banker considers suffocating the prisoner but decides to read a note that the prisoner has left instead. The note expresses the prisoner's contempt for the material world and renounces the two million rubles. The banker kisses the prisoner's head, leaves the lodge, and locks away the note.

The next morning, the watchmen inform the banker that the prisoner has escaped. The banker goes to the lodge and confirms the prisoner's escape. To avoid suspicion, he takes the note and locks it in a fireproof safe. The story ends with the banker in tears, feeling a great contempt for himself.","The story begins with a banker recalling a party he hosted fifteen years ago where the topic of capital punishment was discussed. The majority of the guests disapproved of the death penalty, believing it to be immoral and outdated. The banker, however, argued that the death penalty was more humane than life imprisonment. This sparks a bet between the banker and a young lawyer, who claims that life imprisonment is preferable to death.

The bet is for two million rubles, and the young lawyer agrees to spend fifteen years in solitary confinement if he loses. The banker, excited by the bet, mocks the young lawyer and warns him of the hardships he will face in voluntary confinement.

The young lawyer is placed in a lodge in the banker's garden. The terms of his confinement state that he cannot leave the lodge or have any contact with the outside world. He can only receive books, music, wine, and other necessities through a small window. If he breaks the conditions in any way, even two minutes before the end of the fifteen years, the banker will not have to pay him the two million rubles.

During the first year, the prisoner suffers greatly from loneliness and depression. He refuses wine and tobacco, filling his time with light novels. In the second year, he becomes withdrawn and only asks for classical books. In the fifth year, he consumes excessive amounts of food and drink, spending most of his time in bed. He occasionally cries and writes but tears up his writings in the morning.

In the sixth year, the prisoner becomes deeply interested in studying languages, philosophy, and history. The banker fulfills his requests for books, and the young man sends him a letter in six languages, challenging him to find a mistake. The banker orders two shots to be fired in the garden, indicating that the prisoner's efforts were not in vain.

After the tenth year, the prisoner focuses solely on reading religious texts, particularly the Gospel. In the last two years, he reads a wide variety of books on different subjects, showing his desperate attempt to absorb as much knowledge as possible.

As the fifteenth year approaches, the banker realizes that if he pays the two million rubles, he will be ruined. He contemplates the idea of killing the prisoner to avoid paying him. In the early hours of the morning, the banker goes to the lodge, thinking about how he can stage the murder. However, when he enters the room, he finds the prisoner asleep with a sheet of paper in front of him.

The paper contains a letter from the prisoner, expressing his disdain for freedom, life, and worldly possessions. He claims to have found wisdom in books and believes that everything in life is transient and illusory. He renounces the two million rubles and declares his intention to break the agreement by leaving the lodge five hours before the allotted time.

The banker, deeply moved by the prisoner's words, kisses him on the head and leaves the lodge. The next morning, the watchmen inform the banker that the prisoner escaped through the window and disappeared. The banker goes to the lodge to confirm the escape and retrieves the renunciation letter, locking it away in a safe.

The story ends with the banker feeling contempt for himself and reflecting on the impact the bet has had on his life.",s58
The Boarded Window,Ambrose Bierce,"In 1830, only a few miles away from what is now the great city of Cincinnati, lay an immense and almost unbroken forest. The whole region was sparsely settled by people of the frontier--restless souls who no sooner had hewn fairly habitable homes out of the wilderness and attained to that degree of prosperity which today we should call indigence, than, impelled by some mysterious impulse of their nature, they abandoned all and pushed farther westward, to encounter new perils and privations in the effort to regain the meager comforts which they had voluntarily renounced. Many of them had already forsaken that region for the remoter settlements, but among those remaining was one who had been of those first arriving. He lived alone in a house of logs surrounded on all sides by the great forest, of whose gloom and silence he seemed a part, for no one had ever known him to smile nor speak a needless word. His simple wants were supplied by the sale or barter of skins of wild animals in the river town, for not a thing did he grow upon the land which, if needful, he might have claimed by right of undisturbed possession. There were evidences of ""improvement""--a few acres of ground immediately about the house had once been cleared of its trees, the decayed stumps of which were half concealed by the new growth that had been suffered to repair the ravage wrought by the ax. Apparently the man's zeal for agriculture had burned with a failing flame, expiring in penitential ashes.
The little log house, with its chimney of sticks, its roof of warping clapboards weighted with traversing poles and its ""chinking"" of clay, had a single door and, directly opposite, a window. The latter, however, was boarded up--nobody could remember a time when it was not. And none knew why it was so closed; certainly not because of the occupant's dislike of light and air, for on those rare occasions when a hunter had passed that lonely spot the recluse had commonly been seen sunning himself on his doorstep if heaven had provided sunshine for his need. I fancy there are few persons living today who ever knew the secret of that window, but I am one, as you shall see.
The man's name was said to be Murlock. He was apparently seventy years old, actually about fifty. Something besides years had had a hand in his aging. His hair and long, full beard were white, his gray, lusterless eyes sunken, his face singularly seamed with wrinkles which appeared to belong to two intersecting systems. In figure he was tall and spare, with a stoop of the shoulders--a burden bearer. I never saw him; these particulars I learned from my grandfather, from whom also I got the man's story when I was a lad. He had known him when living near by in that early day.
One day Murlock was found in his cabin, dead. It was not a time and place for coroners and newspapers, and I suppose it was agreed that he had died from natural causes or I should have been told, and should remember. I know only that with what was probably a sense of the fitness of things the body was buried near the cabin, alongside the grave of his wife, who had preceded him by so many years that local tradition had retained hardly a hint of her existence. That closes the final chapter of this true story--excepting, indeed, the circumstance that many years afterward, in company with an equally intrepid spirit, I penetrated to the place and ventured near enough to the ruined cabin to throw a stone against it, and ran away to avoid the ghost which every well-informed boy thereabout knew haunted the spot. But there is an earlier chapter--that supplied by my grandfather.
When Murlock built his cabin and began laying sturdily about with his ax to hew out a farm--the rifle, meanwhile, his means of support--he was young, strong and full of hope. In that eastern country whence he came he had married, as was the fashion, a young woman in all ways worthy of his honest devotion, who shared the dangers and privations of his lot with a willing spirit and light heart. There is no known record of her name; of her charms of mind and person tradition is silent and the doubter is at liberty to entertain his doubt; but God forbid that I should share it! Of their affection and happiness there is abundant assurance in every added day of the man's widowed life; for what but the magnetism of a blessed memory could have chained that venturesome spirit to a lot like that?
One day Murlock returned from gunning in a distant part of the forest to find his wife prostrate with fever, and delirious. There was no physician within miles, no neighbor; nor was she in a condition to be left, to summon help. So he set about the task of nursing her back to health, but at the end of the third day she fell into unconsciousness and so passed away, apparently, with never a gleam of returning reason.
From what we know of a nature like his we may venture to sketch in some of the details of the outline picture drawn by my grandfather. When convinced that she was dead, Murlock had sense enough to remember that the dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty he blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others which he did correctly were done over and over. His occasional failures to accomplish some simple and ordinary act filled him with astonishment, like that of a drunken man who wonders at the suspension of familiar natural laws. He was surprised, too, that he did not weep--surprised and a little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead. ""Tomorrow,"" he said aloud, ""I shall have to make the coffin and dig the grave; and then I shall miss her, when she is no longer in sight; but now--she is dead, of course, but it is all right--it must be all right, somehow. Things cannot be so bad as they seem.""
He stood over the body in the fading light, adjusting the hair and putting the finishing touches to the simple toilet, doing all mechanically, with soulless care. And still through his consciousness ran an undersense of conviction that all was right--that he should have her again as before, and everything explained. He had had no experience in grief; his capacity had not been enlarged by use. His heart could not contain it all, nor his imagination rightly conceive it. He did not know he was so hard struck; that knowledge would come later, and never go. Grief is an artist of powers as various as the instruments upon which he plays his dirges for the dead, evoking from some the sharpest, shrillest notes, from others the low, grave chords that throb recurrent like the slow beating of a distant drum. Some natures it startles; some it stupefies. To one it comes like the stroke of an arrow, stinging all the sensibilities to a keener life; to another as the blow of a bludgeon, which in crushing benumbs. We may conceive Murlock to have been that way affected, for and here we are upon surer ground than that of conjecture no sooner had he finished his pious work than, sinking into a chair by the side of the table upon which the body lay, and noting how white the profile showed in the deepening gloom, he laid his arms upon the table's edge, and dropped his face into them, tearless yet and unutterably weary. At that moment came in through the open window a long, wailing sound like the cry of a lost child in the far deeps of the darkening woods! But the man did not move. Again, and nearer than before, sounded that unearthly cry upon his failing sense. Perhaps it was a wild beast; perhaps it was a dream. For Murlock was asleep.
Some hours later, as it afterward appeared, this unfaithful watcher awoke and lifting his head from his arms intently listened--he knew not why. There in the black darkness by the side of the dead, recalling all without a shock, he strained his eyes to see--he knew not what. His senses were all alert, his breath was suspended, his blood had stilled its tides as if to assist the silence. Who--what had waked him, and where was it?
Suddenly the table shook beneath his arms, and at the same moment he heard, or fancied that he heard, a light, soft step--another--sounds as of bare feet upon the floor!
He was terrified beyond the power to cry out or move. Perforce he waited--waited there in the darkness through seeming centuries of such dread as one may know, yet live to tell. He tried vainly to speak the dead woman's name, vainly to stretch forth his hand across the table to learn if she were there. His throat was powerless, his arms and hands were like lead. Then occurred something most frightful. Some heavy body seemed hurled against the table with an impetus that pushed it against his breast so sharply as nearly to overthrow him, and at the same instant he heard and felt the fall of something upon the floor with so violent a thump that the whole house was shaken by the impact. A scuffling ensued, and a confusion of sounds impossible to describe. Murlock had risen to his feet. Fear had by excess forfeited control of his faculties. He flung his hands upon the table. Nothing was there!
There is a point at which terror may turn to madness; and madness incites to action. With no definite intent, from no motive but the wayward impulse of a madman, Murlock sprang to the wall, with a little groping seized his loaded rifle, and without aim discharged it. By the flash which lit up the room with a vivid illumination, he saw an enormous panther dragging the dead woman toward the window, its teeth fixed in her throat! Then there were darkness blacker than before, and silence; and when he returned to consciousness the sun was high and the wood vocal with songs of birds.
The body lay near the window, where the beast had left it when frightened away by the flash and report of the rifle. The clothing was deranged, the long hair in disorder, the limbs lay anyhow. From the throat, dreadfully lacerated, had issued a pool of blood not yet entirely coagulated. The ribbon with which he had bound the wrists was broken; the hands were tightly clenched. Between the teeth was a fragment of the animal's ear.","In the story, ""The Death of Halpin Frayser,"" the protagonist, Halpin Frayser, is a young man who is haunted by a traumatic event from his childhood. As a child, Halpin witnessed his mother's death when she fell off a cliff. The incident has left him emotionally scarred and haunted by nightmares. Halpin's father, Judge Frayser, is a stern and authoritative figure who is obsessed with maintaining his family's reputation. He is distant and unemotional towards Halpin, which only worsens Halpin's emotional state. Halpin's relationship with his father becomes even more strained when he falls in love with a woman named Louisa, who is from a lower social class. Judge Frayser strongly disapproves of their relationship and tries to separate them. However, Halpin and Louisa are determined to be together and decide to elope. They plan to meet at a specific location, but when Halpin arrives, he finds Louisa dead and her body mutilated. Halpin is devastated and becomes consumed by grief and guilt. He begins to see the ghost of his mother, who taunts and torments him. Halpin's mental state deteriorates further as he becomes convinced that he is responsible for Louisa's death. He eventually commits suicide by drowning himself in the river. The story explores themes of guilt, grief, and the destructive power of unresolved trauma. It also highlights the damaging effects of societal expectations and the consequences of forbidden love.","The story is set in the early 1800s in a remote forest near Cincinnati. The protagonist, Murlock, lives alone in a log cabin and survives by hunting and trading animal skins. He is a reclusive and silent man, never seen smiling or speaking unnecessarily. Murlock is aging prematurely, with white hair, a long white beard, and gaunt features. The story reveals that Murlock's wife died many years ago, and he buried her near their cabin.

The story then flashes back to the time when Murlock and his wife first settled in the forest. They were happy and content, despite the hardships they faced. However, one day, when Murlock returns from hunting, he finds his wife gravely ill with a fever. He knows there is no one nearby to help, so he takes on the task of nursing her back to health. However, his wife's condition worsens, and she eventually dies, never regaining consciousness. Murlock, in his grief, prepares her body for burial and feels a strange sense of calm and acceptance.

As Murlock sits by his wife's body, he hears a wailing cry from outside, but it does not startle him. He falls asleep and wakes up to strange sounds in the darkness. He senses a presence in the room and feels a heavy weight against the table. Suddenly, something falls to the floor with a loud thump. In a panic, Murlock grabs his rifle and shoots, momentarily lighting up the room and revealing a panther attacking his wife's body. When the darkness returns, the panther is gone.

When Murlock regains consciousness the next morning, he finds his wife's body near the window, brutally attacked by the panther. He also realizes that he shot and killed the panther, as a piece of its ear is found in his wife's mouth.

The story ends with the narrator, who heard the story from his grandfather, recounting that he once ventured near Murlock's cabin as a child but was terrified by the ghost rumored to haunt the place. This final chapter adds depth to the eerie and supernatural nature of the story.

The story explores themes of isolation, grief, and the supernatural. Murlock's reclusive nature and his ability to accept his wife's death without visible emotion hint at a deeper connection to the supernatural world. The presence of the panther and the strange occurrences after his wife's death suggest that there may be more to the story than meets the eye.",s59
A Burlesque Biography,Mark Twain,"Two or three persons having at different times intimated that if I would write an autobiography they would read it when they got leisure, I yield at last to this frenzied public demand and herewith tender my history.
Ours is a noble house, and stretches a long way back into antiquity. The earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of was a friend of the family by the name of Higgins. This was in the eleventh century, when our people were living in Aberdeen, county of Cork, England. Why it is that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name except when one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert foolishness, instead of Higgins, is a mystery which none of us has ever felt much desire to stir. It is a kind of vague, pretty romance, and we leave it alone. All the old families do that way.
Arthour Twain was a man of considerable note--a solicitor on the highway in William Rufus's time. At about the age of thirty he went to one of those fine old English places of resort called Newgate, to see about something, and never returned again. While there he died suddenly.
Augustus Twain seems to have made something of a stir about the year 1160. He was as full of fun as he could be, and used to take his old saber and sharpen it up, and get in a convenient place on a dark night, and stick it through people as they went by, to see them jump. He was a born humorist. But he got to going too far with it; and the first time he was found stripping one of these parties, the authorities removed one end of him, and put it up on a nice high place on Temple Bar, where it could contemplate the people and have a good time. He never liked any situation so much or stuck to it so long.
Then for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a succession of soldiers--noble, high-spirited fellows, who always went into battle singing, right behind the army, and always went out a-whooping, right ahead of it.
This is a scathing rebuke to old dead Froissart's poor witticism that our family tree never had but one limb to it, and that that one stuck out at right angles, and bore fruit winter and summer.
Early in the fifteenth century we have Beau Twain, called ""the Scholar."" He wrote a beautiful, beautiful hand. And he could imitate anybody's hand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off to see it. He had infinite sport with his talent. But by and by he took a contract to break stone for a road, and the roughness of the work spoiled his hand. Still, he enjoyed life all the time he was in the stone business, which, with inconsiderable intervals, was some forty-two years. In fact, he died in harness. During all those long years he gave such satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week till the government gave him another. He was a perfect pet. And he was always a favorite with his fellow-artists, and was a conspicuous member of their benevolent secret society, called the Chain Gang. He always wore his hair short, had a preference for striped clothes, and died lamented by the government. He was a sore loss to his country. For he was so regular.
Some years later we have the illustrious John Morgan Twain. He came over to this country with Columbus in 1492 as a passenger. He appears to have been of a crusty, uncomfortable disposition. He complained of the food all the way over, and was always threatening to go ashore unless there was a change. He wanted fresh shad. Hardly a day passed over his head that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air, sneering about the commander, and saying he did not believe Columbus knew where he was going to or had ever been there before. The memorable cry of ""Land ho!"" thrilled every heart in the ship but his. He gazed awhile through a piece of smoked glass at the penciled line lying on the distant water, and then said: ""Land be hanged--it's a raft!""
When this questionable passenger came on board the ship, be brought nothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked ""B. G.,"" one cotton sock marked ""L. W. C.,"" one woolen one marked ""D. F.,"" and a night-shirt marked ""O. M. R."" And yet during the voyage he worried more about his ""trunk,"" and gave himself more airs about it, than all the rest of the passengers put together. If the ship was ""down by the head,"" and would not steer, he would go and move his ""trunk"" further aft, and then watch the effect. If the ship was ""by the stern,"" he would suggest to Columbus to detail some men to ""shift that baggage."" In storms he had to be gagged, because his wailings about his ""trunk"" made it impossible for the men to hear the orders. The man does not appear to have been openly charged with any gravely unbecoming thing, but it is noted in the ship's log as a ""curious circumstance"" that albeit he brought his baggage on board the ship in a newspaper, he took it ashore in four trunks, a queensware crate, and a couple of champagne baskets. But when he came back insinuating, in an insolent, swaggering way, that some of this things were missing, and was going to search the other passengers' baggage, it was too much, and they threw him overboard. They watched long and wonderingly for him to come up, but not even a bubble rose on the quietly ebbing tide. But while every one was most absorbed in gazing over the side, and the interest was momentarily increasing, it was observed with consternation that the vessel was adrift and the anchor-cable hanging limp from the bow. Then in the ship's dimmed and ancient log we find this quaint note:
""In time it was discouvered yt ye troblesome passenger hadde gone downe and got ye anchor, and toke ye same and solde it to ye dam sauvages from ye interior, saying yt he hadde founde it, ye sonne of a ghun!""
Yet this ancestor had good and noble instincts, and it is with pride that we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who ever interested himself in the work of elevating and civilizing our Indians. He built a commodious jail and put up a gallows, and to his dying day he claimed with satisfaction that he had had a more restraining and elevating influence on the Indians than any other reformer that ever labored among them. At this point the chronicle becomes less frank and chatty, and closes abruptly by saying that the old voyager went to see his gallows perform on the first white man ever hanged in America, and while there received injuries which terminated in his death.
The great-grandson of the ""Reformer"" flourished in sixteen hundred and something, and was known in our annals as ""the old Admiral,"" though in history he had other titles. He was long in command of fleets of swift vessels, well armed and manned, and did great service in hurrying up merchantmen. Vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on, always made good fair time across the ocean. But if a ship still loitered in spite of all he could do, his indignation would grow till he could contain himself no longer-- and then he would take that ship home where he lived and keep it there carefully, expecting the owners to come for it, but they never did. And he would try to get the idleness and sloth out of the sailors of that ship by compelling them to take invigorating exercise and a bath. He called it ""walking a plank."" All the pupils liked it. At any rate, they never found any fault with it after trying it. When the owners were late coming for their ships, the Admiral always burned them, so that the insurance money should not be lost. At last this fine old tar was cut down in the fullness of his years and honors. And to her dying day, his poor heart-broken widow believed that if he had been cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been resuscitated.
Charles Henry Twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenth century, and was a zealous and distinguished missionary. He converted sixteen thousand South Sea islanders, and taught them that a dog-tooth necklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come to divine service in. His poor flock loved him very, very dearly; and when his funeral was over, they got up in a body and came out of the restaurant with tears in their eyes, and saying, one to another, that he was a good tender missionary, and they wished they had some more of him.
Pah-go-to-wah-wah-pukketekeewis Mighty-Hunter-with-a-Hog-Eye-Twain adorned the middle of the eighteenth century, and aided General Braddock with all his heart to resist the oppressor Washington. It was this ancestor who fired seventeen times at our Washington from behind a tree. So far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral story-books is correct; but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenth round the awe-stricken savage said solemnly that that man was being reserved by the Great Spirit for some mighty mission, and he dared not lift his sacrilegious rifle against him again, the narrative seriously impairs the integrity of history. What he did say was:
""It ain't no hic no use. 'At man's so drunk he can't stan' still long enough for a man to hit him. I hic I can't 'ford to fool away any more am'nition on him.""
That was why he stopped at the seventeenth round, and it was a good, plain, matter-of-fact reason, too, and one that easily commends itself to us by the eloquent, persuasive flavor of probability there is about it.
I also enjoyed the story-book narrative, but I felt a marring misgiving that every Indian at Braddock's Defeat who fired at a soldier a couple of times two easily grows to seventeen in a century, and missed him, jumped to the conclusion that the Great Spirit was reserving that soldier for some grand mission; and so I somehow feared that the only reason why Washington's case is remembered and the others forgotten is, that in his the prophecy came true, and in that of the others it didn't. There are not books enough on earth to contain the record of the prophecies Indians and other unauthorized parties have made; but one may carry in his overcoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have been fulfilled.
I will remark here, in passing, that certain ancestors of mine are so thoroughly well-known in history by their aliases, that I have not felt it to be worth while to dwell upon them, or even mention them in the order of their birth. Among these may be mentioned Richard Brinsley Twain, alias Guy Fawkes; John Wentworth Twain, alias Sixteen-String Jack; William Hogarth Twain, alias Jack Sheppard; Ananias Twain, alias Baron Munchausen; John George Twain, alias Captain Kydd; and then there are George Francis Twain, Tom Pepper, Nebuchadnezzar, and Baalam's Ass--they all belong to our family, but to a branch of it somewhat distinctly removed from the honorable direct line--in fact, a collateral branch, whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that, in order to acquire the notoriety we have always yearned and hungered for, they have got into a low way of going to jail instead of getting hanged.
It is not well, when writing an autobiography, to follow your ancestry down too close to your own time--it is safest to speak only vaguely of your great-grandfather, and then skip from there to yourself, which I now do.
I was born without teeth--and there Richard III. had the advantage of me; but I was born without a humpback, likewise, and there I had the advantage of him. My parents were neither very poor nor conspicuously honest.
But now a thought occurs to me. My own history would really seem so tame contrasted with that of my ancestors, that it is simply wisdom to leave it unwritten until I am hanged. If some other biographies I have read had stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred, it would have been a felicitous thing for the reading public. How does it strike you?","The narrator begins their autobiography by acknowledging the demand from people to read their life story. They mention their noble lineage, tracing back to the eleventh century in Aberdeen, England. The family name has always been Twain, except for occasional use of aliases. They mention various ancestors and their notable traits. Arthour Twain was a solicitor who mysteriously died while visiting Newgate. Augustus Twain was a humorist who enjoyed pranking people with his saber, but eventually went too far and was executed. The family tree then shows a line of soldiers who were brave and always went into battle singing. The narrator refutes a joke about their family tree having only one limb, emphasizing the bravery and fruitfulness of their ancestors. They continue with the story of Beau Twain, known as ""the Scholar,"" who had a talent for imitating handwriting but ended up working as a stone breaker. Despite this, he enjoyed his work and was highly regarded by the government. The narrator then mentions John Morgan Twain, who was a difficult passenger on Columbus' ship and had a disdainful attitude towards the voyage. He also had a peculiar attachment to his trunk. The ship's log notes that he sold the anchor to Native Americans and disappeared. However, it is mentioned that he was the first white person to work towards civilizing Native Americans. The narrator briefly mentions other ancestors, including Charles Henry Twain, a missionary, and Pah-go-to-wah-wah-pukketekeewis Mighty-Hunter-with-a-Hog-Eye-Twain, who fought against George Washington. The narrator questions the accuracy of the narrative that attributes mystical significance to Washington, suggesting that it may be an exaggeration. They also mention other ancestors who gained notoriety through their aliases and criminal activities. Finally, the narrator decides to leave their own history unwritten until they are hanged, humorously comparing their life to the more exciting and adventurous stories of their ancestors.","The narrator, who is a member of the Twain family, decides to write an autobiography due to the demand from a few people. The narrator explains that the Twain family has a long and noble history, stretching back to the eleventh century. The earliest known ancestor was named Higgins, but for some reason, the family name switched to Twain. The narrator also mentions various ancestors and their notable characteristics.

Arthour Twain was a solicitor in the eleventh century who died suddenly while on a trip to Newgate. Augustus Twain, in the twelfth century, was known for his humor and pranks, including sticking his saber through people as they passed by. However, he was eventually apprehended and punished. The next few generations of the family were soldiers who were brave and spirited in battle.

In the fifteenth century, there was Beau Twain, who was called ""the Scholar"" due to his beautiful handwriting and talent for imitating others' handwriting. He eventually worked as a stonebreaker for forty-two years and died while still active. John Morgan Twain, who lived in the late 1400s, was an uncomfortable and discontented passenger on Columbus' ship. He always complained about the food and doubted Columbus' capabilities. He also had a bizarre fascination with his trunk. When he suspected his belongings were missing, he searched other passengers' baggage, which led to his being thrown overboard.

The narrator then briefly mentions other ancestors, including a missionary named Charles Henry Twain who converted many South Sea islanders and an ancestor named Pah-go-to-wah-wah-pukketekeewis Mighty-Hunter-with-a-Hog-Eye-Twain, who aided General Braddock. The narrator questions the accuracy of the romantic narratives about these ancestors, suggesting that they may have been exaggerated.

The narrator also mentions aliases used by certain ancestors, such as Richard Brinsley Twain and John Wentworth Twain. Finally, the narrator states that their own history seems boring compared to the ancestors' stories and suggests that it would be best to write about their own life experiences after they are hanged, as it would make for a more interesting story.",s60
The Cask of Amontillado,Edgar Allan Poe,"The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was a point definitely settled--but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.
It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good-will. I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.
He had a weak point--this Fortunato--although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity--to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack--but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: I was skillful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.
It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting party-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.
I said to him: ""My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.""
""How?"" said he. ""Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival!""
""I have my doubts,"" I replied; ""and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.""
""Amontillado!""
""I have my doubts.""
""Amontillado!""
""And I must satisfy them.""
""Amontillado!""
""As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a critical turn, it is he. He will tell me-- ""
""Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.""
""And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.""
""Come, let us go.""
""Whither?""
""To your vaults.""
""My friend, no. I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you have an engagement. Luchesi--""
""I have no engagement--come.""
""My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.""
""Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.""
Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask of black silk, and drawing a roquelaure closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.
There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.
I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.
The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.
""The pipe,"" said he.
""It is farther on,"" said I; ""but observe the white webwork which gleams from these cavern walls.""
He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.
""Nitre?"" he asked, at length.
""Nitre,"" I replied. ""How long have you had that cough?""
""Ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh!""
My poor friend found it impossible to reply. for many minutes.
""It is nothing,"" he said at last.
""Come,"" I said, with decision, ""we will go back; your health is precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is Luchesi--""
""Enough,"" he said: ""the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I shall not die of a cough.""
""True--true."" I replied; ""and indeed, I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.""
Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.
""Drink,"" I said, presenting him the wine.
He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.
""I drink,"" he said, ""to the buried that repose around us.""
""And I to your long life.""
He again took my arm, and we proceeded.
""These vaults,"" he said, ""are extensive.""
""The Montresors,"" I replied, ""were a great and numerous family.""
""I forget your arms.""
""A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are embedded in the heel.""
""And the motto?""
""Nemo me impune lacessit.""
""Good!"" he said.
The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.
""The nitre!"" I said; ""see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the vaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough--""
""It is nothing,"" he said; ""let us go on. But first, another draught of the Medoc.""
I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grâve. He emptied it at a breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed, and threw the bottle upward with a gesticulation I did not understand.
I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.
""You do not comprehend?"" he said.
""Not I,"" I replied.
""Then you are not of the brotherhood.""
""How?""
""You are not of the masons.""
""Yes, yes,"" I said, ""yes, yes.""
""You? Impossible! A mason?""
""A mason,"" I replied.
""A sign,"" he said.
""It is this,"" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaure.
""You jest,"" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. ""But let us proceed to the Amontillado.""
""Be it so,"" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and, descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.
At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones we perceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.
It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored to pry into the depth of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.
""Proceed,"" I said; ""herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi--""
""He is an ignoramus,"" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key, I stepped back from the recess.
""Pass your hand,"" I said, ""over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre. Indeed it is very damp. Once more let me implore you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power.""
""The Amontillado!"" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.
""True,"" I replied; ""the Amontillado.""
As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building-stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.
I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was not the cry of a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the masonwork, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.
A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a brief moment I hesitated--I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him who clamoured. I reëchoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamourer grew still.
It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice said:
""Ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he! he!--over our wine--he! he! he!""
""The Amontillado!"" I said.
""He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado. But is it not getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo--the Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.""
""Yes,"" I said, ""let us be gone.""
""For the love of God, Montresor!""
""Yes,"" I said, ""for the love of God!""
But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I called aloud:
""Fortunato!""
No answer. I called again:
""Fortunato!""
No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick--on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I hastened to make an end of my labour. I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I reërected the old rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them. In pace requiescat.","The narrator, who remains unnamed, is seeking revenge on a man named Fortunato, who has insulted him. The narrator is determined to punish Fortunato, but he wants to do so without being caught. He knows that he needs to make Fortunato feel the weight of his revenge. The narrator pretends to be friendly with Fortunato, even though he secretly plans to harm him.

Fortunato prides himself on his knowledge of wine, and the narrator uses this weakness to his advantage. During the carnival season, the narrator encounters Fortunato, who is heavily intoxicated. The narrator tells Fortunato that he has obtained a pipe of Amontillado, a type of wine, but he is unsure if it is genuine. He suggests that they go to Luchesi, another wine connoisseur, to get his opinion. Fortunato, eager to prove his expertise, insists on going to the narrator's vaults to taste the Amontillado.

The narrator leads Fortunato through his empty house, convincing him that they are alone. They descend into the catacombs, and as they go deeper, Fortunato's drunkenness becomes more apparent. The narrator mentions the dampness of the catacombs, but Fortunato dismisses it. The narrator offers him wine to alleviate the cold and dampness.

As they continue their journey, the narrator reveals that he is a member of a secret society, the Masons, and shows Fortunato a trowel as proof. Fortunato, intrigued, follows the narrator to a recessed area in the catacombs. The narrator chains Fortunato to the granite wall and begins to wall up the entrance of the niche, burying Fortunato alive.

Fortunato initially protests and screams, but the narrator continues to build the wall, ignoring his pleas. Eventually, Fortunato falls silent, and the narrator completes the wall. He listens for any signs of life but hears nothing. Satisfied with his revenge, the narrator leaves the catacombs.

The story concludes with the narrator reflecting on his actions, stating that no one has disturbed the tomb for fifty years. He ends by saying, ""In pace requiescat,"" which means ""Rest in peace.""","The narrator has been insulted by a man named Fortunato and vows revenge. He approaches Fortunato during the carnival season and tells him that he has obtained a pipe of Amontillado, a rare and expensive wine, but has doubts about its authenticity. Fortunato, who prides himself on his knowledge of wine, insists on accompanying the narrator to his palazzo to taste the wine. They arrive at the narrator's home, which is empty since the staff has gone to celebrate the carnival. The narrator leads Fortunato through the catacombs beneath the house, using Fortunato's passion for wine as a lure. As they descend further into the catacombs, Fortunato becomes increasingly drunk. The narrator takes advantage of this and chains Fortunato to a wall in a small recess. The narrator proceeds to brick up the entrance of the recess, effectively entombing Fortunato alive. As he finishes the task, Fortunato realizes what is happening and pleads for mercy, but the narrator ignores him. The narrator then leaves, sealing the wall and leaving Fortunato to die in the darkness. The story closes with the narrator reflecting on the fact that no one has disturbed Fortunato's resting place for fifty years, and wishing him ""rest in peace.""",s61
The Christening,Guy de Maupassant,"""Well doctor, a little brandy?""
""With pleasure.""
The old ship's surgeon, holding out his glass, watched it as it slowly filled with the golden liquid. Then, holding it in front of his eyes, he let the light from the lamp stream through it, smelled it, tasted a few drops and smacked his lips with relish. Then he said:
""Ah! the charming poison! Or rather the seductive murderer, the delightful destroyer of peoples!
""You people do not know it the way I do. You may have read that admirable book entitled L'Assommoir, but you have not, as I have, seen alcohol exterminate a whole tribe of savages, a little kingdom of negroes--alcohol calmly unloaded by the barrel by red-bearded English seamen.
""Right near here, in a little village in Brittany near Pont-l'Abbe, I once witnessed a strange and terrible tragedy caused by alcohol. I was spending my vacation in a little country house left me by my father. You know this flat coast where the wind whistles day and night, where one sees, standing or prone, these giant rocks which in the olden times were regarded as guardians, and which still retain something majestic and imposing about them. I always expect to see them come to life and start to walk across the country with the slow and ponderous tread of giants, or to unfold enormous granite wings and fly toward the paradise of the Druids.
""Everywhere is the sea, always ready on the slightest provocation to rise in its anger and shake its foamy mane at those bold enough to brave its wrath.
""And the men who travel on this terrible sea, which, with one motion of its green back, can overturn and swallow up their frail barks--they go out in the little boats, day and night, hardy, weary and drunk. They are often drunk. They have a saying which says: 'When the bottle is full you see the reef, but when it is empty you see it no more.'
""Go into one of their huts; you will never find the father there. If you ask the woman what has become of her husband, she will stretch her arms out over the dark ocean which rumbles and roars along the coast. He remained, there one night, when he had had too much to drink; so did her oldest son. She has four more big, strong, fair-haired boys. Soon it will be their time.
""As I said, I was living in a little house near Pont-l'Abbe. I was there alone with my servant, an old sailor, and with a native family which took care of the grounds in my absence. It consisted of three persons, two sisters and a man, who had married one of them, and who attended to the garden.
""A short time before Christmas my gardener's wife presented him with a boy. The husband asked me to stand as god-father. I could hardly deny the request, and so he borrowed ten francs from me for the cost of the christening, as he said.
""The second day of January was chosen as the date of the ceremony. For a week the earth had been covered by an enormous white carpet of snow, which made this flat, low country seem vast and limitless. The ocean appeared to be black in contrast with this white plain; one could see it rolling, raging and tossing its waves as though wishing to annihilate its pale neighbor, which appeared to be dead, it was so calm, quiet and cold.
""At nine o'clock the father, Kerandec, came to my door with his sister-in-law, the big Kermagan, and the nurse, who carried the infant wrapped up in a blanket. We started for the church. The weather was so cold that it seemed to dry up the skin and crack it open. I was thinking of the poor little creature who was being carried on ahead of us, and I said to myself that this Breton race must surely be of iron, if their children were able, as soon as they were born, to stand such an outing.
""We came to the church, but the door was closed; the priest was late.
""Then the nurse sat down on one of the steps and began to undress the child. At first I thought there must have been some slight accident, but I saw that they were leaving the poor little fellow naked completely naked, in the icy air. Furious at such imprudence, I protested:
""'Why, you are crazy! You will kill the child!'
""The woman answered quietly: 'Oh, no, sir; he must wait naked before the Lord.'
""The father and the aunt looked on undisturbed. It was the custom. If it were not adhered to misfortune was sure to attend the little one.
""I scolded, threatened and pleaded. I used force to try to cover the frail creature. All was in vain. The nurse ran away from me through the snow, and the body of the little one turned purple. I was about to leave these brutes when I saw the priest coming across the country, followed by the sexton and a young boy. I ran towards him and gave vent to my indignation. He showed no surprise nor did he quicken his pace in the least. He answered:
""'What can you expect, sir? It's the custom. They all do it, and it's of no use trying to stop them.'
""'But at least hurry up!' I cried.
""He answered: 'But I can't go any faster.'
""He entered the vestry, while we remained outside on the church steps. I was suffering. But what about the poor little creature who was howling from the effects of the biting cold.
""At last the door opened. He went into the church. But the poor child had to remain naked throughout the ceremony. It was interminable. The priest stammered over the Latin words and mispronounced them horribly. He walked slowly and with a ponderous tread. His white surplice chilled my heart. It seemed as though, in the name of a pitiless and barbarous god, he had wrapped himself in another kind of snow in order to torture this little piece of humanity that suffered so from the cold.
""Finally the christening was finished according to the rites and I saw the nurse once more take the frozen, moaning child and wrap it up in the blanket.
""The priest said to me: 'Do you wish to sign the register?'
""Turning to my gardener, I said: ""Hurry up and get home quickly so that you can warm that child.' I gave him some advice so as to ward off, if not too late, a bad attack of pneumonia. He promised to follow my instructions and left with his sister-in-law and the nurse. I followed the priest into the vestry, and when I had signed he demanded five francs for expenses.
""As I had already given the father ten francs, I refused to pay twice. The priest threatened to destroy the paper and to annul the ceremony. I, in turn, threatened him with the district attorney. The dispute was long, and I finally paid five francs.
""As soon as I reached home I went down to Kerandec's to find out whether everything was all right. Neither father, nor sister-in-law, nor nurse had yet returned. The mother, who had remained alone, was in bed, shivering with cold and starving, for she had had nothing to eat since the day before.
""'Where the deuce can they have gone?' I asked. She answered without surprise or anger, 'They're going to drink something to celebrate: It was the custom. Then I thought, of my ten francs which were to pay the church and would doubtless pay for the alcohol.
""I sent some broth to the mother and ordered a good fire to be built in the room. I was uneasy and furious and promised myself to drive out these brutes, wondering with terror what was going to happen to the poor infant.
""It was already six, and they had not yet returned. I told my servant to wait for them and I went to bed. I soon fell asleep and slept like a top. At daybreak I was awakened by my servant, who was bringing me my hot water.
""As soon as my eyes were open I asked: 'How about Kerandec?'
""The man hesitated and then stammered: 'Oh! he came back, all right, after midnight, and so drunk that he couldn't walk, and so were Kermagan and the nurse. I guess they must have slept in a ditch, for the little one died and they never even noticed it.'
""I jumped up out of bed, crying:
""'What! The child is dead?'
""'Yes, sir. They brought it back to Mother Kerandec. When she saw it she began to cry, and now they are making her drink to console her.'
""'What's that? They are making her drink!'
""'Yes, sir. I only found it out this morning. As Kerandec had no more brandy or money, he took some wood alcohol, which monsieur gave him for the lamp, and all four of them are now drinking that. The mother is feeling pretty sick now.'
""I had hastily put on some clothes, and seizing a stick, with the intention of applying it to the backs of these human beasts, I hastened towards the gardener's house.
""The mother was raving drunk beside the blue body of her dead baby. Kerandec, the nurse, and the Kermagan woman were snoring on the floor. I had to take care of the mother, who died towards noon.""
The old doctor was silent. He took up the brandy-bottle and poured out another glass. He held it up to the lamp, and the light streaming through it imparted to the liquid the amber color of molten topaz. With one gulp he swallowed the treacherous drink.","The story begins with a ship's surgeon and a doctor having a conversation. The ship's surgeon reminisces about witnessing the devastating effects of alcohol on a tribe of savages and a village in Brittany. He describes how alcohol is unloaded by red-bearded English seamen and leads to the destruction of these communities.

The ship's surgeon then recounts a personal experience he had while on vacation in a village near Pont-l'Abbe in Brittany. He was staying in a country house with his servant and a native family consisting of two sisters and a man who took care of the garden. The man's wife gave birth to a baby boy, and the ship's surgeon was asked to be the godfather.

On the day of the christening, the weather was extremely cold with snow covering the ground. The group went to the church, but the priest was late, so they had to wait outside. The ship's surgeon noticed that the nurse began undressing the baby, leaving him completely naked in the freezing air. When he protested, the nurse explained that it was a custom to leave the child naked before the Lord and that it was believed to bring good luck.

The ship's surgeon tried to cover the baby, but the nurse ran away, leaving the child exposed to the cold. Finally, the priest arrived, and the christening ceremony began. However, the ship's surgeon couldn't help but feel that the priest's slow and cold demeanor mirrored the freezing temperature and the suffering of the child.

After the ceremony, the ship's surgeon went home and later visited the family to check on the baby. He discovered that the father, the aunt, and the nurse had not returned and that the mother was starving and freezing in bed. The ship's surgeon sent food and ordered a fire to be built but grew increasingly worried about the baby's well-being.

The ship's surgeon went to bed and was awakened the next morning by his servant, who informed him that the father and the others had returned drunk, and the baby had died without their notice. Shocked and furious, the ship's surgeon rushed to the family's house, where he found the mother drunk beside the lifeless body of her child. The father, the nurse, and the aunt were also passed out on the floor.

Realizing that they were drinking wood alcohol due to their lack of money, the ship's surgeon attempted to care for the mother, but she died later that day.

The story ends with the ship's surgeon pouring himself another glass of brandy and consuming it, reflecting on the destructive power of alcohol.","The story begins with a ship's surgeon and a doctor enjoying brandy together. The ship's surgeon starts talking about the dangers of alcohol. He shares an incident he witnessed in Brittany where alcohol caused a tragedy. He describes the coastal area and the heavy drinking habits of the local fishermen. He mentions that the men often go out to sea drunk and many do not return, leaving behind devastated families.

The ship's surgeon then recounts a specific incident that occurred near Pont-l'Abbe, where he was staying in a country house. He explains that a gardener and his family, who took care of the house, invited him to be the godfather of their newborn child. On the day of the christening, they set out for the church, but found it closed as the priest was late. In the freezing cold weather, the nurse unwrapped the baby, leaving it naked on the steps of the church, claiming it was a custom. The ship's surgeon protests, but the family remains indifferent. When the priest finally arrives, the ceremony is long and cold, causing the baby to cry in distress. After the christening, the ship's surgeon leaves in frustration, while the family stays behind to drink and celebrate. 

Upon returning to the gardener's house, the ship's surgeon finds that the family has not yet returned and the mother is in bed, starving and freezing. The ship's surgeon sends food and a fire for the mother and becomes increasingly worried about the baby's welfare. When the family still doesn't return by morning, the ship's surgeon's servant reports that they came back drunk late at night and didn't even notice when the baby died. The ship's surgeon is enraged and rushes to the gardener's house, only to find the mother drunk beside the lifeless baby. The gardener, the nurse, and the relative are all passed out on the floor. The ship's surgeon tries to take care of the mother, but she eventually dies.

After recounting this tragic story, the ship's surgeon takes another glass of brandy and drinks it in one gulp.",s62
Coco,Guy de Maupassant,"Throughout the whole countryside the Lucas farm, was known as ""the Manor."" No one knew why. The peasants doubtless attached to this word, ""Manor,"" a meaning of wealth and of splendor, for this farm was undoubtedly the largest, richest and the best managed in the whole neighborhood.
The immense court, surrounded by five rows of magnificent trees, which sheltered the delicate apple trees from the harsh wind of the plain, inclosed in its confines long brick buildings used for storing fodder and grain, beautiful stables built of hard stone and made to accommodate thirty horses, and a red brick residence which looked like a little chateau.
Thanks for the good care taken, the manure heaps were as little offensive as such things can be; the watch-dogs lived in kennels, and countless poultry paraded through the tall grass.
Every day, at noon, fifteen persons, masters, farmhands and the women folks, seated themselves around the long kitchen table where the soup was brought in steaming in a large, blue-flowered bowl.
The beasts-horses, cows, pigs and sheep-were fat, well fed and clean. Maitre Lucas, a tall man who was getting stout, would go round three times a day, overseeing everything and thinking of everything.
A very old white horse, which the mistress wished to keep until its natural death, because she had brought it up and had always used it, and also because it recalled many happy memories, was housed, through sheer kindness of heart, at the end of the stable.
A young scamp about fifteen years old, Isidore Duval by name, and called, for convenience, Zidore, took care of this pensioner, gave him his measure of oats and fodder in winter, and in summer was supposed to change his pasturing place four times a day, so that he might have plenty of fresh grass.
The animal, almost crippled, lifted with difficulty his legs, large at the knees and swollen above the hoofs. His coat, which was no longer curried, looked like white hair, and his long eyelashes gave to his eyes a sad expression.
When Zidore took the animal to pasture, he had to pull on the rope with all his might, because it walked so slowly; and the youth, bent over and out of breath, would swear at it, exasperated at having to care for this old nag.
The farmhands, noticing the young rascal's anger against Coco, were amused and would continually talk of the horse to Zidore, in order to exasperate him. His comrades would make sport with him. In the village he was called Coco-Zidore.
The boy would fume, feeling an unholy desire to revenge himself on the horse. He was a thin, long-legged, dirty child, with thick, coarse, bristly red hair. He seemed only half-witted, and stuttered as though ideas were unable to form in his thick, brute-like mind.
For a long time he had been unable to understand why Coco should be kept, indignant at seeing things wasted on this useless beast. Since the horse could no longer work, it seemed to him unjust that he should be fed; he revolted at the idea of wasting oats, oats which were so expensive, on this paralyzed old plug. And often, in spite of the orders of Maitre Lucas, he would economize on the nag's food, only giving him half measure. Hatred grew in his confused, childlike mind, the hatred of a stingy, mean, fierce, brutal and cowardly peasant.
When summer came he had to move the animal about in the pasture. It was some distance away. The rascal, angrier every morning, would start, with his dragging step, across the wheat fields. The men working in the fields would shout to him, jokingly:
""Hey, Zidore, remember me to Coco.""
He would not answer; but on the way he would break off a switch, and, as soon as he had moved the old horse, he would let it begin grazing; then, treacherously sneaking up behind it, he would slash its legs. The animal would try to escape, to kick, to get away from the blows, and run around in a circle about its rope, as though it had been inclosed in a circus ring. And the boy would slash away furiously, running along behind, his teeth clenched in anger.
Then he would go away slowly, without turning round, while the horse watched him disappear, his ribs sticking out, panting as a result of his unusual exertions. Not until the blue blouse of the young peasant was out of sight would he lower his thin white head to the grass.
As the nights were now warm, Coco was allowed to sleep out of doors, in the field behind the little wood. Zidore alone went to see him. The boy threw stones at him to amuse himself. He would sit down on an embankment about ten feet away and would stay there about half an hour, from time to time throwing a sharp stone at the old horse, which remained standing tied before his enemy, watching him continually and not daring to eat before he was gone.
This one thought persisted in the mind of the young scamp: ""Why feed this horse, which is no longer good for anything?"" It seemed to him that this old nag was stealing the food of the others, the goods of man and God, that he was even robbing him, Zidore, who was working.
Then, little by little, each day, the boy began to shorten the length of rope which allowed the horse to graze.
The hungry animal was growing thinner, and starving. Too feeble to break his bonds, he would stretch his head out toward the tall, green, tempting grass, so near that he could smell, and yet so far that he could not touch it.
But one morning Zidore had an idea: it was, not to move Coco any more. He was tired of walking so far for that old skeleton. He came, however, in order to enjoy his vengeance. The beast watched him anxiously. He did not beat him that day. He walked around him with his hands in his pockets. He even pretended to change his place, but he sank the stake in exactly the same hole, and went away overjoyed with his invention.
The horse, seeing him leave, neighed to call him back; but the rascal began to run, leaving him alone, entirely alone in his field, well tied down and without a blade of grass within reach.
Starving, he tried to reach the grass which he could touch with the end of his nose. He got on his knees, stretching out his neck and his long, drooling lips. All in vain. The old animal spent the whole day in useless, terrible efforts. The sight of all that green food, which stretched out on all sides of him, served to increase the gnawing pangs of hunger.
The scamp did not return that day. He wandered through the woods in search of nests.
The next day he appeared upon the scene again. Coco, exhausted, had lain down. When he saw the boy, he got up, expecting at last to have his place changed.
But the little peasant did not even touch the mallet, which was lying on the ground. He came nearer, looked at the animal, threw at his head a clump of earth which flattened out against the white hair, and he started off again, whistling.
The horse remained standing as long as he could see him; then, knowing that his attempts to reach the near-by grass would be hopeless, he once more lay down on his side and closed his eyes.
The following day Zidore did not come.
When he did come at last, he found Coco still stretched out; he saw that he was dead.
Then he remained standing, looking at him, pleased with what he had done, surprised that it should already be all over. He touched him with his foot, lifted one of his legs and then let it drop, sat on him and remained there, his eyes fixed on the grass, thinking of nothing. He returned to the farm, but did not mention the accident, because he wished to wander about at the hours when he used to change the horse's pasture. He went to see him the next day. At his approach some crows flew away. Countless flies were walking over the body and were buzzing around it. When he returned home, he announced the event. The animal was so old that nobody was surprised. The master said to two of the men:
""Take your shovels and dig a hole right where he is.""
The men buried the horse at the place where he had died of hunger. And the grass grew thick, green and vigorous, fed by the poor body.","The story revolves around the Lucas farm, also known as ""the Manor,"" which is the largest and most well-managed farm in the area. The farm is known for its beautiful surroundings, well-fed animals, and meticulous care. One of the animals on the farm is Coco, an old white horse who is no longer able to work. Coco is taken care of by a young boy named Zidore, who resents the horse and feels it is a waste to feed him. Zidore mistreats Coco, slashing his legs and starving him by shortening his grazing rope. Eventually, Coco dies from hunger, and Zidore takes pleasure in his vengeance. The farm workers bury Coco, and the grass grows lush and green where his body is laid to rest.","The Lucas farm, affectionately referred to as ""the Manor"" by the locals, is a prosperous and well-managed estate. It boasts a grand residence, beautiful stables, and well-fed, healthy animals. However, there is one exception - Coco, an old white horse kept by the mistress due to sentimental reasons. The horse is unable to work and is cared for by a young peasant boy named Zidore. Zidore resents Coco, believing it is a waste to feed him, and slowly begins to mistreat the horse by withholding its food and inflicting physical harm. Zidore's cruelty escalates to the point where he ties Coco up without access to grass, starving him. Eventually, Coco dies of hunger, and Zidore takes pleasure in his demise. The horse is buried where it died, and the field flourishes with lush green grass, nourished by Coco's body.",s63
The Coming-Out of Maggie,O. Henry,"Every Saturday night the Clover Leaf Social Club gave a hop in the hall of the Give and Take Athletic Association on the East Side. In order to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the Give and Take--or, if you belong to the division that starts off with the right foot in waltzing, you must work in Rhinegold's paper-box factory. Still, any Clover Leaf was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance. But mostly each Give and Take brought the paper-box girl that he affected; and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops.
Maggie Toole, on account of her dull eyes, broad mouth and left- handed style of footwork in the twostep, went to the dances with Anna McCarty and her ""fellow."" Anna and Maggie worked side by side in the factory, and were the greatest chums ever. So Anna always made Jimmy Burns take her by Maggie's house every Saturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them.
The Give and Take Athletic Association lived up to its name. The hall of the association in Orchard street was fitted out with muscle-making inventions. With the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous combat. Between these more serious occupations the Saturday night hop with the paper-box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen. For sometimes the tip went 'round, and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter-weight affair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes.
On Saturdays Rhinegold's paper-box factory closed at 3 P. M. On one such afternoon Anna and Maggie walked homeward together. At Maggie's door Anna said, as usual: ""Be ready at seven, sharp, Mag; and Jimmy and we'll come by for you.""
But what was this? Instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the non-escorted one there was to be perceived a high- poised head, a prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth, and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye.
""Thanks, Anna,"" said Maggie; ""but you and Jimmy needn't bother to-night. I've a gentleman friend that's coming 'round to escort me to the hop.""
The comely Anna pounced upon her friend, shook her, chided and beseeched her. Maggie Toole catch a fellow! Plain, dear, loyal, unattractive Maggie, so sweet as a chum, so unsought for a two-step or a moonlit bench in the little park. How was it? When did it happen? Who was it?
""You'll see to-night,"" said Maggie, flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had gathered in Cupid's vineyard. ""He's swell all right. He's two inches taller than Jimmy, and an up-to-date dresser. I'll introduce him, Anna, just as soon as we get to the hall.""
Anna and Jimmy were among the first Clover Leafs to arrive that evening. Anna's eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friend's ""catch.""
At 8:30 Miss Toole swept into the hall with her escort. Quickly her triumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful Jimmy.
""Oh, gee!"" cried Anna, ""Mag ain't made a hit--oh, no! Swell fellow? well, I guess! Style? Look at 'um.""
""Go as far as you like,"" said Jimmy, with sandpaper in his voice. ""Cop him out if you want him. These new guys always win out with the push. Don't mind me. He don't squeeze all the limes, I guess. Huh!""
""Shut up, Jimmy. You know what I mean. I'm glad for Mag. First fellow she ever had. Oh, here they come.""
Across the floor Maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser. And truly, her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum. He stood two inches taller than the average Give and Take athlete; his dark hair curled; his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles. The young men of the Clover Leaf Club pinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess, its achievements in hand-to-hand conflicts, and its preservation from the legal duress that constantly menaced it. The member of the association who would bind a paperbox maiden to his conquering chariot scorned to employ Beau Brummel airs. They were not considered honourable methods of warfare. The swelling biceps, the coat straining at its buttons over the chest, the air of conscious conviction of the supereminence of the male in the cosmogony of creation, even a calm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents in the gentle tourneys of Cupid--these were the approved arms and ammunition of the Clover Leaf gallants. They viewed, then, genuflexions and alluring poses of this visitor with their chins at a new angle.
""A friend of mine, Mr. Terry O'Sullivan,"" was Maggie's formula of introduction. She led him around the room, presenting him to each new-arriving Clover Leaf. Almost was she pretty now, with the unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor and a kitten with its first mouse.
""Maggie Toole's got a fellow at last,"" was the word that went round among the paper-box girls. ""Pipe Mag's floor-walker""--thus the Give and Takes expressed their indifferent contempt.
Usually at the weekly hops Maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back. She felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a self- sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished. She had even grown used to noticing Anna joggle the reluctant Jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two-step.
But to-night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six. Terry O'Sullivan was a victorious Prince Charming, and Maggie Toole winged her first butterfly flight. And though our tropes of fairyland be mixed with those of entomology they shall not spill one drop of ambrosia from the rose-crowned melody of Maggie's one perfect night.
The girls besieged her for introductions to her ""fellow."" The Clover Leaf young men, after two years of blindness, suddenly perceived charms in Miss Toole. They flexed their compelling muscles before her and bespoke her for the dance.
Thus she scored; but to Terry O'Sullivan the honours of the evening fell thick and fast. He shook his curls; he smiled and went easily through the seven motions for acquiring grace in your own room before an open window ten minutes each day. He danced like a faun; he introduced manner and style and atmosphere; his words came trippingly upon his tongue, and--he waltzed twice in succession with the paper- box girl that Dempsey Donovan brought.
Dempsey was the leader of the association. He wore a dress suit, and could chin the bar twice with one hand. He was one of ""Big Mike"" O'Sullivan's lieutenants, and was never troubled by trouble. No cop dared to arrest him. Whenever be broke a pushcart man's head or shot a member of the Heinrick B. Sweeney Outing and Literary Association in the kneecap, an officer would drop around and say:
""The Cap'n 'd like to see ye a few minutes round to the office whin ye have time, Dempsey, me boy.""
But there would be sundry gentlemen there with large gold fob chains and black cigars; and somebody would tell a funny story, and then Dempsey would go back and work half an hour with the sixpound dumbbells. So, doing a tight-rope act on a wire stretched across Niagara was a safe terpsichorean performance compared with waltzing twice with Dempsey Donovan's paper-box girl. At 10 o'clock the jolly round face of ""Big Mike"" O'Sullivan shone at the door for five minutes upon the scene. He always looked in for five minutes, smiled at the girls and handed out real perfectos to the delighted boys.
Dempsey Donovan was at his elbow instantly, talking rapidly. ""Big Mike"" looked carefully at the dancers, smiled, shook his head and departed.
The music stopped. The dancers scattered to the chairs along the walls. Terry O'Sullivan, with his entrancing bow, relinquished a pretty girl in blue to her partner and started back to find Maggie. Dempsey intercepted him in the middle of the floor.
Some fine instinct that Rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly every one to turn and look at them--there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena. Two or three Give and Takes with tight coat sleeves drew nearer.
""One moment, Mr. O'Sullivan,"" said Dempsey. ""I hope you're enjoying yourself. Where did you say you live?""
The two gladiators were well matched. Dempsey had, perhaps, ten pounds of weight to give away. The O'Sullivan had breadth with quickness. Dempsey had a glacial eye, a dominating slit of a mouth, an indestructible jaw, a complexion like a belle's and the coolness of a champion. The visitor showed more fire in his contempt and less control over his conspicuous sneer. They were enemies by the law written when the rocks were molten. They were each too splendid, too mighty, too incomparable to divide pre-eminence. One only must survive.
""I live on Grand,"" said O'Sullivan, insolently; ""and no trouble to find me at home. Where do you live?""
Dempsey ignored the question.
""You say your name's O'Sullivan,"" he went on. ""Well, 'Big Mike' says he never saw you before.""
""Lots of things he never saw,"" said the favourite of the hop.
""As a rule,"" went on Dempsey, huskily sweet, ""O'Sullivans in this district know one another. You escorted one of our lady members here, and we want chance to make good. If you've got a family tree let's see a few historical O'Sullivan buds come out on it. Or do you want us to dig it out of you by the roots?""
""Suppose you mind your own business,"" suggested O'Sullivan, blandly.
Dempsey's eye brightened. He held up an inspired forefinger as though a brilliant idea had struck him.
""I've got it now,"" he said cordially. ""It was just a little mistake. You ain't no O'Sullivan. You are a ring-tailed monkey. Excuse us for not recognising you at first.""
O'Sullivan's eye flashed. He made a quick movement, but Andy Geoghan was ready and caught his arm.
Dempsey nodded at Andy and William McMahan, the secretary of the club, and walked rapidly toward a door at the rear of the hall. Two other members of the Give and Take Association swiftly joined the little group. Terry O'Sullivan was now in the hands of the Board of Rules and Social Referees. They spoke to him briefly and softly, and conducted him out through the same door at the rear.
This movement on the part of the Clover Leaf members requires a word of elucidation. Back of the association hall was a smaller room rented by the club. In this room personal difficulties that arose on the ballroom floor were settled, man to man, with the weapons of nature, under the supervision of the board. No lady could say that she had witnessed a fight at a Clover Leaf hop in several years. Its gentlemen members guaranteed that.
So easily and smoothly had Dempsey and the board done their preliminary work that many in the hall had not noticed the checking of the fascinating O'Sullivan's social triumph. Among these was Maggie. She looked about for her escort.
""Smoke up!"" said Rose Cassidy. ""Wasn't you on? Demps Donovan picked a scrap with your Lizzie-boy, and they've waltzed out to the slaughter room with him. How's my hair look done up this way, Mag?""
Maggie laid a hand on the bosom of her cheesecloth waist.
""Gone to fight with Dempsey!"" she said, breathlessly. ""They've got to be stopped. Dempsey Donovan can't fight him. Why, he'll--he'll kill him!""
""Ah, what do you care?"" said Rosa. ""Don't some of 'em fight every hop?""
But Maggie was off, darting her zig-zag way through the maze of dancers. She burst through the rear door into the dark hall and then threw her solid shoulder against the door of the room of single combat. It gave way, and in the instant that she entered her eye caught the scene--the Board standing about with open watches; Dempsey Donovan in his shirt sleeves dancing, light-footed, with the wary grace of the modern pugilist, within easy reach of his adversary; Terry O'Sullivan standing with arms folded and a murderous look in his dark eyes. And without slacking the speed of her entrance she leaped forward with a scream--leaped in time to catch and hang upon the arm of O'Sullivan that was suddenly uplifted, and to whisk from it the long, bright stiletto that he had drawn from his bosom.
The knife fell and rang upon the floor. Cold steel drawn in the rooms of the Give and Take Association! Such a thing had never happened before. Every one stood motionless for a minute. Andy Geoghan kicked the stiletto with the toe of his shoe curiously, like an antiquarian who has come upon some ancient weapon unknown to his learning.
And then O'Sullivan hissed something unintelligible between his teeth. Dempsey and the board exchanged looks. And then Dempsey looked at O'Sullivan without anger, as one looks at a stray dog, and nodded his head in the direction of the door.
""The back stairs, Giuseppi,"" he said, briefly. ""Somebody'll pitch your hat down after you.""
Maggie walked up to Dempsey Donovan. There was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks, down which slow tears were running. But she looked him bravely in the eye.
""I knew it, Dempsey,"" she said, as her eyes grew dull even in their tears. ""I knew he was a Guinea. His name's Tony Spinelli. I hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin'. Them Guineas always carries knives. But you don't understand, Dempsey. I never had a fellow in my life. I got tired of comin' with Anna and Jimmy every night, so I fixed it with him to call himself O'Sullivan, and brought him along. I knew there'd be nothin' doin' for him if he came as a Dago. I guess I'll resign from the club now.""
Dempsey turned to Andy Geoghan.
""Chuck that cheese slicer out of the window,"" he said, ""and tell 'em inside that Mr. O'Sullivan has had a telephone message to go down to Tammany Hall.""
And then he turned back to Maggie.
""Say, Mag,"" he said, ""I'll see you home. And how about next Saturday night? Will you come to the hop with me if I call around for you?""
It was remarkable how quickly Maggie's eyes could change from dull to a shining brown.
""With you, Dempsey?"" she stammered. ""Say--will a duck swim?""","Every Saturday night, the Clover Leaf Social Club holds a dance at the Give and Take Athletic Association.

Panicked, Maggie rushes to the room where the fight is taking place and finds that Terry has drawn a knife. Without hesitation, she intervenes by grabbing Terry's arm and disarming him.

Confessing,Guy de Maupassant,"The noon sun poured fiercely down upon the fields. They stretched in undulating folds between the clumps of trees that marked each farmhouse; the different crops, ripe rye and yellowing wheat, pale-green oats, dark-green clover, spread a vast striped cloak, soft and rippling, over the naked body of the earth.
In the distance, on the crest of a slope, was an endless line of cows, ranked like soldiers, some lying down, others standing, their large eyes blinking in the burning light, chewing the cud and grazing on a field of clover as broad as a lake.
Two women, mother and daughter, were walking with a swinging step, one behind the other, towards this regiment of cattle. Each carried two zinc pails, slung outwards from the body on a hoop from a cask; at each step the metal sent out a dazzling white flash under the sun that struck full upon it.
The women did not speak. They were on their way to milk the cows. When they arrive, they set down one of their pails and approach the first two cows, making them stand up with a kick in the ribs from wooden-shod feet. The beast rises slowly, first on its forelegs, then with more difficulty raises its large hind quarters, which seem to be weighted down by the enormous udder of livid pendulous flesh.
The two Malivoires, mother and daughter, kneeling beneath the animal's belly, tug with a swift movement of their hands at the swollen teat, which at each squeeze sends a slender jet of milk into the pail. The yellowish froth mounts to the brim, and the women go from cow to cow until they reach the end of the long line.
As soon as they finish milking a beast, they change its position, giving it a fresh patch of grass on which to graze.
Then they start on their way home, more slowly now, weighed down by the load of milk, the mother in front, the daughter behind.
Abruptly the latter halts, sets down her burden, Sits down, and begins to cry.
Madame Malivoire, missing the sound of steps behind her, turns round and is quite amazed.
""What's the matter with you?"" she said.
Her daughter Celeste, a tall girl with flaming red hair and flaming cheeks, flecked with freckles as though sparks of fire had fallen upon her face one day as she worked in the sun, murmurs, moaning softly, like a beaten child:
""I can't carry the milk any further.""
Her mother looked at her suspiciously.
""What's the matter with you?"" she repeated.
""It drags too heavy, I can't,"" replied Celeste, who had collapsed and was lying on the ground between the two pails, hiding her eyes in her apron.
""What's the matter with you, then?"" said her mother for the third time. The girl moaned:
""I think there's a baby on the way."" And she broke into sobs.
The old woman now in her turn set down her load, so amazed that she could find nothing to say. At last she stammered:
""You . . . you . . . you're going to have a baby, you clod! How can that be?""
The Malivoires were prosperous farmers, wealthy and of a certain position, widely respected, good business folk, of some importance in the district.
""I think I am, all the same,"" faltered Celeste.
The frightened mother looked at the weeping girl grovelling at her feet. After a few seconds she cried:
""You're going to have a baby! A baby! Where did you get it, you slut?""
Celeste, shaken with emotion, murmured:
""I think it was in Polyte's coach.""
The old woman tried to understand, tried to imagine, to realise who could have brought this misfortune upon her daughter. If the lad was well off and of decent position, an arrangement might be come to. The damage could still be repaired. Celeste was not the first to be in the same way, but it was annoying all the same, seeing their position and the way people talked.
""And who was it, you slut?"" she repeated.
Celeste, resolved to make a clean breast of it, stammered:
""I think it was Polyte.""
At that Madame Malivoire, mad with rage, rushed upon her daughter and began to beat her with such fury that her hat fell off in the effort.
With great blows of the fist she struck her on the head, on the back, all over her body; Celeste, prostrate between the two pails, which afforded her some slight protection, shielded just her face with her hands.
All the cows, disturbed, had stopped grazing and turned round, staring with their great eyes. The last one mooed, stretching out its muzzle towards the women.
After beating her daughter till she was out of breath, Madame Malivoire stopped, exhausted; her spirits reviving a little, she tried to get a thorough understanding of the situation.
""--- Polyte! Lord save us, it's not possible! How could you, with a carrier? You must have lost your wits. He must have played you a trick, the good-for-nothing!""
Celeste, still prostrate, murmured in the dust:
""I didn't pay my fare!""
And the old Norman woman understood.
Every week, on Wednesday and on Saturday, Celeste went to town with the farm produce, poultry, cream, and eggs.
She started at seven with her two huge baskets on her arm, the dairy produce in one, the chickens in the other, and went to the main road to wait for the coach to Yvetot.
She set down her wares and sat in the ditch, while the chickens with their short pointed beaks and the ducks with their broad flat bills thrust their heads between the wicker bars and looked about them with their round, stupid, surprised eyes.
Soon the bus, a sort of yellow box with a black leather cap on the top, came up, jerking and quivering with the trotting of the old white horse.
Polyte the coachman, a big, jolly fellow, stout though still young, and so burnt up by sun and wind, soaked by rain, and coloured with brandy that his face and neck were brick-red, cracked his whip and shouted from the distance:
""Morning, Mam'selle Celeste. In good health, I hope?""
She gave him her baskets, one after the other, which he stowed in the boot; then she got in, lifting her leg high up to reach the step, and exposing a sturdy leg clad in a blue stocking.
Every time Polyte repeated the same joke: ""Well, it's not got any thinner.""
She laughed, thinking this funny.
Then he uttered a ""Gee up, old girl!"" which started off the thin horse. Then Celeste, reaching for her purse in the depths of her pocket, slowly took out fivepence, threepence for herself and twopence for the baskets, and handed them to Polyte over his shoulder.
He took them, saying:
""Aren't we going to have our little bit of sport to-day?""
And he laughed heartily, turning round towards her so as to stare at her at his ease.
She found it a big expense, the half-franc for a journey of two miles. And when she had no coppers she felt it still more keenly; it was hard to make up her mind to part with a silver coin.
One day, as she was paying, she asked:
""From a good customer like me you oughtn't to take more than threepence.""
He burst out laughing.
""Threepence, my beauty; why, you're worth more than that.""
She insisted on the point.
""But you make a good two francs a month out of me.""
He whipped up his horse and exclaimed:
""Look here, I'm an obliging fellow! We'll call it quits for a bit of sport.""
""What do you mean?"" she asked with an air of innocence.
He was so amused that he laughed till he coughed.
""A bit of sport is a bit of sport, damn it; a game for a lad and a lass, a dance for two without music.""
She understood, blushed, and declared:
""I don't care for that sort of game, Monsieur Polyte.""
But he was in no way abashed, and repeated, with growing merriment:
""You'll come to it some day, my beauty, a bit of sport for a lad and a lass!""
And since that day he had taken to asking her, each time that she paid her fare:
""Aren't we going to have our bit of sport to-day?""
She, too, joked about it by this time, and replied:
""Not to-day, Monsieur Polyte, but Saturday, for certain!""
And amid peals of laughter he answered:
""Saturday, then, my beauty.""
But inwardly she calculated that, during the two years the affair had been going on, she had paid Polyte forty-eight whole francs, and in the country forty-eight francs is not a sum which can be picked up on the roadside; she also calculated that in two more years she would have paid nearly a hundred francs.
To such purpose she meditated that, one spring day as they jogged on alone, when he made his customary inquiry: ""Aren't we going to have our bit of sport yet?"" She replied:
""Yes, if you like, Monsieur Polyte.""
He was not at all surprised, and clambered over the back of his seat, murmuring with a complacent air:
""Come along, then. I knew you'd come to it some day.""
The old white horse trotted so gently that she seemed to be dancing upon the same spot, deaf to the voice which cried at intervals, from the depths of the vehicle: ""Gee up, old girl! Gee up, then!""
Three months later Celeste discovered that she was going to have a child.
All this she had told her mother in a tearful voice. Pale with fury, the old woman asked:
""Well, what did it cost?""
""Four months; that makes eight francs, doesn't it?"" replied Celeste.
At that the peasant woman's fury was utterly unleashed, and, falling once more upon her daughter, she beat her a second time until she was out of breath. Then she rose and said:
""Have you told him about the baby?""
""No, of course not.""
""Why haven't you told him?""
""Because very likely he'd have made me pay for all the free rides!""
The old woman pondered awhile, then picked up her milkpails.
""Come on, get up, and try to walk home,"" she said, and, after a pause, continued:
""And don't tell him as long as he doesn't notice anything, and we'll make six or eight months' fares out of him.""
And Celeste, who had risen, still crying, dishevelled and swollen round the eyes, started off again with dragging steps, murmuring:
""Of course I won't say.""","In a rural setting, a mother and daughter, Madame Malivoire and Celeste, work as milkmaids. They walk towards a line of cows to milk them. Celeste suddenly stops and reveals that she is pregnant. Madame Malivoire is shocked and angry, and she beats Celeste. Celeste explains that she became pregnant after having a sexual encounter with Polyte, the coachman she pays to take her to town. Madame Malivoire suggests that they keep the pregnancy a secret from Polyte until they can extract more money from him. Celeste agrees, and they continue their journey home.","In the story, a mother and daughter, Madame Malivoire and Celeste, work together as milkmaids on a farm. One day, while they are milking the cows, Celeste suddenly breaks down in tears and confesses to her mother that she is pregnant.

Madame Malivoire is shocked and angry, but also realizes that they can use this situation to their advantage. She tells Celeste not to tell Polyte about the baby and they decide to continue taking free rides with him for as long as possible, in order to save money.

Lamb to the Slaughter,Roald Dahl,"The room was warm and clean, the curtains drawn, the two table lamps alight-hers and the one by the empty chair opposite. On the sideboard behind her, two tall glasses, soda water, whiskey. Fresh ice cubes in the Thermos bucket.
Mary Maloney was waiting for her husband to come home from work.
Now and again she would glance up at the clock, but without anxiety, merely to please herself with the thought that each minute gone by made it nearer the time when he would come. There was a slow smiling air about her, and about everything she did. The drop of a head as she bent over her sewing was curiously tranquil. Her skin--for this was her sixth month with child--had acquired a wonderful translucent quality, the mouth was soft, and the eyes, with their new placid look, seemed larger darker than before. When the clock said ten minutes to five, she began to listen, and a few moments later, punctually as always, she heard the tires on the gravel outside, and the car door slamming, the footsteps passing the window, the key turning in the lock. She laid aside her sewing, stood up, and went forward to kiss him as he came in.
""Hullo darling,"" she said.
""Hullo darling,"" he answered.
She took his coat and hung it in the closet. Then she walked over and made the drinks, a strongish one for him, a weak one for herself; and soon she was back again in her chair with the sewing, and he in the other, opposite, holding the tall glass with both hands, rocking it so the ice cubes tinkled against the side.
For her, this was always a blissful time of day. She knew he didn't want to speak much until the first drink was finished, and she, on her side, was content to sit quietly, enjoying his company after the long hours alone in the house. She loved to luxuriate in the presence of this man, and to feel-almost as a sunbather feels the sun-that warm male glow that came out of him to her when they were alone together. She loved him for the way he sat loosely in a chair, for the way he came in a door, or moved slowly across the room with long strides. She loved intent, far look in his eyes when they rested in her, the funny shape of the mouth, and especially the way he remained silent about his tiredness, sitting still with himself until the whiskey had taken some of it away.
""Tired darling?""
""Yes,"" he said. ""I'm tired,"" And as he spoke, he did an unusual thing. He lifted his glass and drained it in one swallow although there was still half of it, at least half of it left.. She wasn't really watching him, but she knew what he had done because she heard the ice cubes falling back against the bottom of the empty glass when he lowered his arm. He paused a moment, leaning forward in the chair, then he got up and went slowly over to fetch himself another.
""I'll get it!"" she cried, jumping up.
""Sit down,"" he said.
When he came back, she noticed that the new drink was dark amber with the quantity of whiskey in it.
""Darling, shall I get your slippers?""
""No.""
She watched him as he began to sip the dark yellow drink, and she could see little oily swirls in the liquid because it was so strong.
""I think it's a shame,"" she said, ""that when a policeman gets to be as senior as you, they keep him walking about on his feet all day long.""
He didn't answer, so she bent her head again and went on with her sewing; but each time he lifted the drink to his lips, she heard the ice cubes clinking against the side of the glass.
""Darling,"" she said. ""Would you like me to get you some cheese? I haven't made any supper because it's Thursday.""
""No,"" he said.
""If you're too tired to eat out,"" she went on, ""it's still not too late. There's plenty of meat and stuff in the freezer, and you can have it right here and not even move out of the chair.""
Her eyes waited on him for an answer, a smile, a little nod, but he made no sign.
""Anyway,"" she went on, ""I'll get you some cheese and crackers first.""
""I don't want it,"" he said.
She moved uneasily in her chair, the large eyes still watching his face. ""But you must eat! I'll fix it anyway, and then you can have it or not, as you like.""
She stood up and placed her sewing on the table by the lamp.
""Sit down,"" he said. ""Just for a minute, sit down.""
It wasn't till then that she began to get frightened.
""Go on,"" he said. ""Sit down.""
She lowered herself back slowly into the chair, watching him all the time with those large, bewildered eyes. He had finished the second drink and was staring down into the glass, frowning.
""Listen,"" he said. ""I've got something to tell you.""
""What is it, darling? What's the matter?""
He had now become absolutely motionless, and he kept his head down so that the light from the lamp beside him fell across the upper part of his face, leaving the chin and mouth in shadow. She noticed there was a little muscle moving near the corner of his left eye.
""This is going to be a bit of a shock to you, I'm afraid,"" he said. ""But I've thought about it a good deal and I've decided the only thing to do is tell you right away. I hope you won't blame me too much.""
And he told her. It didn't take long, four or five minutes at most, and she say very still through it all, watching him with a kind of dazed horror as he went further and further away from her with each word.
""So there it is,"" he added. ""And I know it's kind of a bad time to be telling you, bet there simply wasn't any other way. Of course I'll give you money and see you're looked after. But there needn't really be any fuss. I hope not anyway. It wouldn't be very good for my job.""
Her first instinct was not to believe any of it, to reject it all. It occurred to her that perhaps he hadn't even spoken, that she herself had imagined the whole thing. Maybe, if she went about her business and acted as though she hadn't been listening, then later, when she sort of woke up again, she might find none of it had ever happened.
""I'll get the supper,"" she managed to whisper, and this time he didn't stop her.
When she walked across the room she couldn't feel her feet touching the floor. She couldn't feel anything at all- except a slight nausea and a desire to vomit. Everything was automatic now-down the steps to the cellar, the light switch, the deep freeze, the hand inside the cabinet taking hold of the first object it met. She lifted it out, and looked at it. It was wrapped in paper, so she took off the paper and looked at it again.
A leg of lamb.
All right then, they would have lamb for supper. She carried it upstairs, holding the thin bone-end of it with both her hands, and as she went through the living-room, she saw him standing over by the window with his back to her, and she stopped.
""For God's sake,"" he said, hearing her, but not turning round. ""Don't make supper for me. I'm going out.""
At that point, Mary Maloney simply walked up behind him and without any pause she swung the big frozen leg of lamb high in the air and brought it down as hard as she could on the back of his head.
She might just as well have hit him with a steel club.
She stepped back a pace, waiting, and the funny thing was that he remained standing there for at least four or five seconds, gently swaying. Then he crashed to the carpet.
The violence of the crash, the noise, the small table overturning, helped bring her out of he shock. She came out slowly, feeling cold and surprised, and she stood for a while blinking at the body, still holding the ridiculous piece of meat tight with both hands.
All right, she told herself. So I've killed him.
It was extraordinary, now, how clear her mind became all of a sudden. She began thinking very fast. As the wife of a detective, she knew quite well what the penalty would be. That was fine. It made no difference to her. In fact, it would be a relief. On the other hand, what about the child? What were the laws about murderers with unborn children? Did they kill then both-mother and child? Or did they wait until the tenth month? What did they do?
Mary Maloney didn't know. And she certainly wasn't prepared to take a chance.
She carried the meat into the kitchen, placed it in a pan, turned the oven on high, and shoved t inside. Then she washed her hands and ran upstairs to the bedroom. She sat down before the mirror, tidied her hair, touched up her lops and face. She tried a smile. It came out rather peculiar. She tried again.
""Hullo Sam,"" she said brightly, aloud.
The voice sounded peculiar too.
""I want some potatoes please, Sam. Yes, and I think a can of peas.""
That was better. Both the smile and the voice were coming out better now. She rehearsed it several times more. Then she ran downstairs, took her coat, went out the back door, down the garden, into the street.
It wasn't six o'clock yet and the lights were still on in the grocery shop.
""Hullo Sam,"" she said brightly, smiling at the man behind the counter.
""Why, good evening, Mrs. Maloney. How're you?""
""I want some potatoes please, Sam. Yes, and I think a can of peas.""
The man turned and reached up behind him on the shelf for the peas.
""Patrick's decided he's tired and doesn't want to eat out tonight,"" she told him. ""We usually go out Thursdays, you know, and now he's caught me without any vegetables in the house.""
""Then how about meat, Mrs. Maloney?""
""No, I've got meat, thanks. I got a nice leg of lamb from the freezer.""
""Oh.""
""I don't know much like cooking it frozen, Sam, but I'm taking a chance on it this time. You think it'll be all right?""
""Personally,"" the grocer said, ""I don't believe it makes any difference. You want these Idaho potatoes?""
""Oh yes, that'll be fine. Two of those.""
""Anything else?"" The grocer cocked his head on one side, looking at her pleasantly. ""How about afterwards? What you going to give him for afterwards?""
""Well-what would you suggest, Sam?""
The man glanced around his shop. ""How about a nice big slice of cheesecake? I know he likes that.""
""Perfect,"" she said. ""He loves it.""
And when it was all wrapped and she had paid, she put on her brightest smile and said, ""Thank you, Sam. Goodnight.""
""Goodnight, Mrs. Maloney. And thank you.""
And now, she told herself as she hurried back, all she was doing now, she was returning home to her husband and he was waiting for his supper; and she must cook it good, and make it as tasty as possible because the poor man was tired; and if, when she entered the house, she happened to find anything unusual, or tragic, or terrible, then naturally it would be a shock and she'd become frantic with grief and horror. Mind you, she wasn't expecting to find anything. She was just going home with the vegetables. Mrs. Patrick Maloney going home with the vegetables on Thursday evening to cook supper for her husband.
That's the way, she told herself. Do everything right and natural. Keep things absolutely natural and there'll be no need for any acting at all.
Therefore, when she entered the kitchen by the back door, she was humming a little tune to herself and smiling.
""Patrick!"" she called. ""How are you, darling?""
She put the parcel down on the table and went through into the living room; and when she saw him lying there on the floor with his legs doubled up and one arm twisted back underneath his body, it really was rather a shock. All the old love and longing for him welled up inside her, and she ran over to him, knelt down beside him, and began to cry her heart out. It was easy. No acting was necessary.
A few minutes later she got up and went to the phone. She know the number of the police station, and when the man at the other end answered, she cried to him, ""Quick! Come quick! Patrick's dead!""
""Who's speaking?""
""Mrs. Maloney. Mrs. Patrick Maloney.""
""You mean Patrick Maloney's dead?""
""I think so,"" she sobbed. ""He's lying on the floor and I think he's dead.""
""Be right over,"" the man said.
The car came very quickly, and when she opened the front door, two policeman walked in. She know them both-she know nearly all the man at that precinct-and she fell right into a chair, then went over to join the other one, who was called O'Malley, kneeling by the body.
""Is he dead?"" she cried.
""I'm afraid he is. What happened?""
Briefly, she told her story about going out to the grocer and coming back to find him on the floor. While she was talking, crying and talking, Noonan discovered a small patch of congealed blood on the dead man's head. He showed it to O'Malley who got up at once and hurried to the phone.
Soon, other men began to come into the house. First a doctor, then two detectives, one of whom she know by name. Later, a police photographer arrived and took pictures, and a man who know about fingerprints. There was a great deal of whispering and muttering beside the corpse, and the detectives kept asking her a lot of questions. But they always treated her kindly. She told her story again, this time right from the beginning, when Patrick had come in, and she was sewing, and he was tired, so tired he hadn't wanted to go out for supper. She told how she'd put the meat in the oven-""it's there now, cooking""- and how she'd slopped out to the grocer for vegetables, and come back to find him lying on the floor.
Which grocer?"" one of the detectives asked.
She told him, and he turned and whispered something to the other detective who immediately went outside into the street.
In fifteen minutes he was back with a page of notes, and there was more whispering, and through her sobbing she heard a few of the whispered phrases-""...acted quite normal...very cheerful...wanted to give him a good supper...peas...cheesecake...impossible that she...""
After a while, the photographer and the doctor departed and two other men came in and took the corpse away on a stretcher. Then the fingerprint man went away. The two detectives remained, and so did the two policeman. They were exceptionally nice to her, and Jack Noonan asked if she wouldn't rather go somewhere else, to her sister's house perhaps, or to his own wife who would take care of her and put her up for the night.
No, she said. She didn't feel she could move even a yard at the moment. Would they mind awfully of she stayed just where she was until she felt better. She didn't feel too good at the moment, she really didn't.
Then hadn't she better lie down on the bed? Jack Noonan asked.
No, she said. She'd like to stay right where she was, in this chair. A little later, perhaps, when she felt better, she would move.
So they left her there while they went about their business, searching the house. Occasionally on of the detectives asked her another question. Sometimes Jack Noonan spoke at her gently as he passed by. Her husband, he told her, had been killed by a blow on the back of the head administered with a heavy blunt instrument, almost certainly a large piece of metal. They were looking for the weapon. The murderer may have taken it with him, but on the other hand he may have thrown it away or hidden it somewhere on the premises.
""It's the old story,"" he said. ""Get the weapon, and you've got the man.""
Later, one of the detectives came up and sat beside her. Did she know, he asked, of anything in the house that could've been used as the weapon? Would she mind having a look around to see if anything was missing-a very big spanner, for example, or a heavy metal vase.
They didn't have any heavy metal vases, she said.
""Or a big spanner?""
She didn't think they had a big spanner. But there might be some things like that in the garage.
The search went on. She knew that there were other policemen in the garden all around the house. She could hear their footsteps on the gravel outside, and sometimes she saw a flash of a torch through a chink in the curtains. It began to get late, nearly nine she noticed by the clock on the mantle. The four men searching the rooms seemed to be growing weary, a trifle exasperated.
""Jack,"" she said, the next tome Sergeant Noonan went by. ""Would you mind giving me a drink?""
""Sure I'll give you a drink. You mean this whiskey?""
""Yes please. But just a small one. It might make me feel better.""
He handed her the glass.
""Why don't you have one yourself,"" she said. ""You must be awfully tired. Please do. You've been very good to me.""
""Well,"" he answered. ""It's not strictly allowed, but I might take just a drop to keep me going.""
One by one the others came in and were persuaded to take a little nip of whiskey. They stood around rather awkwardly with the drinks in their hands, uncomfortable in her presence, trying to say consoling things to her. Sergeant Noonan wandered into the kitchen, come out quickly and said, ""Look, Mrs. Maloney. You know that oven of yours is still on, and the meat still inside.""
""Oh dear me!"" she cried. ""So it is!""
""I better turn it off for you, hadn't I?""
""Will you do that, Jack. Thank you so much.""
When the sergeant returned the second time, she looked at him with her large, dark tearful eyes. ""Jack Noonan,"" she said.
""Yes?""
""Would you do me a small favor-you and these others?""
""We can try, Mrs. Maloney.""
""Well,"" she said. ""Here you all are, and good friends of dear Patrick's too, and helping to catch the man who killed him. You must be terrible hungry by now because it's long past your suppertime, and I know Patrick would never forgive me, God bless his soul, if I allowed you to remain in his house without offering you decent hospitality. Why don't you eat up that lamb that's in the oven. It'll be cooked just right by now.""
""Wouldn't dream of it,"" Sergeant Noonan said.
""Please,"" she begged. ""Please eat it. Personally I couldn't tough a thing, certainly not what's been in the house when he was here. But it's all right for you. It'd be a favor to me if you'd eat it up. Then you can go on with your work again afterwards.""
There was a good deal of hesitating among the four policemen, but they were clearly hungry, and in the end they were persuaded to go into the kitchen and help themselves. The woman stayed where she was, listening to them speaking among themselves, their voices thick and sloppy because their mouths were full of meat.
""Have some more, Charlie?""
""No. Better not finish it.""
""She wants us to finish it. She said so. Be doing her a favor.""
""Okay then. Give me some more.""
""That's the hell of a big club the gut must've used to hit poor Patrick,"" one of them was saying. ""The doc says his skull was smashed all to pieces just like from a sledgehammer.""
""That's why it ought to be easy to find.""
""Exactly what I say.""
""Whoever done it, they're not going to be carrying a thing like that around with them longer than they need.""
One of them belched.
""Personally, I think it's right here on the premises.""
""Probably right under our very noses. What you think, Jack?""
And in the other room, Mary Maloney began to giggle.","Mary Maloney is eagerly waiting for her husband, Patrick, to come home from work. When he arrives, she greets him lovingly and makes drinks for both of them. They sit together, enjoying each other's company. However, Patrick seems distant and tense.

A Dead Woman's Secret,Guy de Maupassant,"The woman had died without pain, quietly, as a woman should whose life had been blameless. Now she was resting in her bed, lying on her back, her eyes closed, her features calm, her long white hair carefully arranged as though she had done it up ten minutes before dying. The whole pale countenance of the dead woman was so collected, so calm, so resigned that one could feel what a sweet soul had lived in that body, what a quiet existence this old soul had led, how easy and pure the death of this parent had been.
Kneeling beside the bed, her son, a magistrate with inflexible principles, and her daughter, Marguerite, known as Sister Eulalie, were weeping as though their hearts would break. She had, from childhood up, armed them with a strict moral code, teaching them religion, without weakness, and duty, without compromise. He, the man, had become a judge and handled the law as a weapon with which he smote the weak ones without pity. She, the girl, influenced by the virtue which had bathed her in this austere family, had become the bride of the Church through her loathing for man.
They had hardly known their father, knowing only that he had made their mother most unhappy, without being told any other details.
The nun was wildly-kissing the dead woman's hand, an ivory hand as white as the large crucifix lying across the bed. On the other side of the long body the other hand seemed still to be holding the sheet in the death grasp; and the sheet had preserved the little creases as a memory of those last movements which precede eternal immobility.
A few light taps on the door caused the two sobbing heads to look up, and the priest, who had just come from dinner, returned. He was red and out of breath from his interrupted digestion, for he had made himself a strong mixture of coffee and brandy in order to combat the fatigue of the last few nights and of the wake which was beginning.
He looked sad, with that assumed sadness of the priest for whom death is a bread winner. He crossed himself and approaching with his professional gesture: ""Well, my poor children! I have come to help you pass these last sad hours."" But Sister Eulalie suddenly arose. ""Thank you, ""father, but my brother and I prefer to remain alone with her. This is our last chance to see her, and we wish to be together, all three of us, as we--we--used to be when we were small and our poor mo--mother----""
Grief and tears stopped her; she could not continue.
Once more serene, the priest bowed, thinking of his bed. ""As you wish, my children."" He kneeled, crossed himself, prayed, arose and went out quietly, murmuring: ""She was a saint!""
They remained alone, the dead woman and her children. The ticking of the clock, hidden in the shadow, could be heard distinctly, and through the open window drifted in the sweet smell of hay and of woods, together with the soft moonlight. No other noise could be heard over the land except the occasional croaking of the frog or the chirping of some belated insect. An infinite peace, a divine melancholy, a silent serenity surrounded this dead woman, seemed to be breathed out from her and to appease nature itself.
Then the judge, still kneeling, his head buried in the bed clothes, cried in a voice altered by grief and deadened by the sheets and blankets: ""Mamma, mamma, mamma!"" And his sister, frantically striking her forehead against the woodwork, convulsed, twitching and trembling as in an epileptic fit, moaned: ""Jesus, Jesus, mamma, Jesus!"" And both of them, shaken by a storm of grief, gasped and choked.
The crisis slowly calmed down and they began to weep quietly, just as on the sea when a calm follows a squall.
A rather long time passed and they arose and looked at their dead. And the memories, those distant memories, yesterday so dear, to-day so torturing, came to their minds with all the little forgotten details, those little intimate familiar details which bring back to life the one who has left. They recalled to each other circumstances, words, smiles, intonations of the mother who was no longer to speak to them. They saw her again happy and calm. They remembered things which she had said, and a little motion of the hand, like beating time, which she often used when emphasizing something important.
And they loved her as they never had loved her before. They measured the depth of their grief, and thus they discovered how lonely they would find themselves.
It was their prop, their guide, their whole youth, all the best part of their lives which was disappearing. It was their bond with life, their mother, their mamma, the connecting link with their forefathers which they would thenceforth miss. They now became solitary, lonely beings; they could no longer look back.
The nun said to her brother: ""You remember how mamma used always to read her old letters; they are all there in that drawer. Let us, in turn, read them; let us live her whole life through tonight beside her! It would be like a road to the cross, like making the acquaintance of her mother, of our grandparents, whom we never knew, but whose letters are there and of whom she so often spoke, do you remember?""
Out of the drawer they took about ten little packages of yellow paper, tied with care and arranged one beside the other. They threw these relics on the bed and chose one of them on which the word ""Father"" was written. They opened and read it.
It was one of those old-fashioned letters which one finds in old family desk drawers, those epistles which smell of another century. The first one started: ""My dear,"" another one: ""My beautiful little girl,"" others: ""My dear child,"" or: ""My dear daughter."" And suddenly the nun began to read aloud, to read over to the dead woman her whole history, all her tender memories. The judge, resting his elbow on the bed, was listening with his eyes fastened on his mother. The motionless body seemed happy.
Sister Eulalie, interrupting herself, said suddenly:
""These ought to be put in the grave with her; they ought to be used as a shroud and she ought to be buried in it."" She took another package, on which no name was written. She began to read in a firm voice: ""My adored one, I love you wildly. Since yesterday I have been suffering the tortures of the damned, haunted by our memory. I feel your lips against mine, your eyes in mine, your breast against mine. I love you, I love you! You have driven me mad. My arms open, I gasp, moved by a wild desire to hold you again. My whole soul and body cries out for you, wants you. I have kept in my mouth the taste of your kisses--""
The judge had straightened himself up. The nun stopped reading. He snatched the letter from her and looked for the signature. There was none, but only under the words, ""The man who adores you,"" the name ""Henry."" Their father's name was Rene. Therefore this was not from him. The son then quickly rummaged through the package of letters, took one out and read: ""I can no longer live without your caresses."" Standing erect, severe as when sitting on the bench, he looked unmoved at the dead woman. The nun, straight as a statue, tears trembling in the corners of her eyes, was watching her brother, waiting. Then he crossed the room slowly, went to the window and stood there, gazing out into the dark night.
When he turned around again Sister Eulalie, her eyes dry now, was still standing near the bed, her head bent down.
He stepped forward, quickly picked up the letters and threw them pell-mell back into the drawer. Then he closed the curtains of the bed.
When daylight made the candles on the table turn pale the son slowly left his armchair, and without looking again at the mother upon whom he had passed sentence, severing the tie that united her to son and daughter, he said slowly: ""Let us now retire, sister.""","The story begins with the death of a woman who had lived a blameless life. Her son, a magistrate, and her daughter, Sister Eulalie, mourn her loss deeply. They were raised with strict moral values and religion by their mother, who had a troubled relationship with their absent father. The priest arrives to offer his condolences but is asked to leave so that the siblings can have some final moments alone with their mother.

As they grieve, memories of their mother flood their minds, and they realize the depth of their love for her and the emptiness they will feel without her. Sister Eulalie suggests reading their mother's old letters as a way to relive her life and learn about their ancestors. They choose a letter addressed to their father and begin reading it aloud. The judge, their brother, listens intently, observing their mother's peaceful body.

Suddenly, Sister Eulalie comes across a letter that is not from their father. It is a passionate and explicit love letter signed by someone named Henry. Confused and disturbed, the judge looks for more letters and finds another one expressing the same intense desire. Realizing that their mother had a secret lover, the judge remains composed while the nun, with tears in her eyes, watches his reaction.

The plot of the story revolves around the death of a woman and the discovery of her secret love letters by her children. It explores their grief, the revelation of their mother's hidden life, and the emotional impact it has on them. The character development focuses on the strict upbringing of the children, their deep love for their mother, and their individual reactions to the discovery of her secret.","The story begins with the peaceful death of a woman. Her son, a magistrate, and her daughter, Sister Eulalie, mourn by her bedside. Their mother had raised them with strict moral values and religious devotion. They had little knowledge of their father, except that he had made their mother unhappy.
As the priest enters the room to offer his condolences, Sister Eulalie politely declines his company, wishing to spend this final time alone with her mother and her brother. After the priest leaves, they remain in the room, grieving for their lost mother.
As time passes, they reminisce about their mother and the memories they shared with her. They realize that with her passing, they have lost not only their mother but also their connection to their past and their ancestors.
Sister Eulalie suggests reading their mother's old letters as a way to relive her life and understand their family history. They choose a letter addressed to their father and begin to read it aloud. The judge pays close attention to his mother's expression as his sister reads.
Suddenly, Sister Eulalie comes across a letter without a name or signature, expressing passionate love and desire. The judge realizes that it is not from their father and quickly finds another letter confirming an affair. He remains composed and walks to the window to gather his thoughts.
When he turns back to his sister, she is still standing by the bed, tears no longer in her eyes. The judge collects the letters and throws them back into the drawer, closing the curtains of the bed.
As daylight breaks, the judge decides it is time to leave and suggests that they retire. They silently exit the room, leaving behind their mother, whose ties to her children have now been severed by the judge's revelation.",s67
The Door,E. B. white,"Everything he kept saying is something it isn't. And everybody is always somewhere else. Maybe it was the city, being in the city, that made him feel how queer everything was and that it was something else. Maybe he kept thinking it was the names of the things. The names were tex and frequently koid. Or they were flex and oid or they were duroid sand or flexsan duro, but everything was glass but not quite glass and the thing that you touched the surface, washable, crease-resistant was rubber, only it wasn't quite rubber and you didn't quite touch it but almost. The wall, which was glass but turned out on being approached not to be a wall, it was something else, it was an opening or doorway--and the doorway through which he saw himself approaching turned out to be something else, it was a wall. And what he had eaten not having agreed with him.
He was in a washable house, but he wasn't sure. Now about those rats, he kept saying to himself. He meant the rats that the Professor had driven crazy by forcing them to deal with problems which were beyond the scope of rats, the insoluble problems. He meant the rats that had been trained to jump at the square card with the circle in the middle, and the card because it was something it wasn't would give way and let the rat into a place where the food was, but then one day it would be a trick played on the rat, and the card would be changed, and the rat would jump but the card wouldn't give way, and it was an impossible situation for a rat and the rat would go insane and into its eyes would come the unspeakably bright imploring look of the frustrated, and after the convulsions were over and the frantic racing around, then the passive stage would set in and the willingness to let anything be done to it, even if it was something else.
He didn't know which door or wall or opening in the house to jump at, to get through, because one was an opening that wasn't a door it was a void, or kid and the other was a wall that wasn't an opening, it was a sanitary cupboard of the same color. He caught a glimpse of his eyes staring into his eyes, in the and in them was the expression he had seen in the picture of the rats--weary after convulsions and the frantic racing around, when they were willing and did not mind having anything done to them. More and more he kept saying I am confronted by a problem which is incapable of solution for this time even if he chose the right door, there would be no food behind it and that is what madness is, and things seeming different from what they are. He heard, in the house where he was, in the city to which he had gone as toward a door which might, or might not, give way, a noise--not a loud noise but more of a low prefabricated humming. It came from a place in the base of the wall or stat where the flue carrying the filterable air was, and not far from the Minipiano, which was made of the same material nailbrushes are made of, and which was under the stairs. ""This, too, has been tested,"" she said, pointing, but not at it, ""and found viable."" It wasn't a loud noise, he kept thinking, sorry that he had seen his eyes, even though it was through his own eyes that he had seen them.
First will come the convulsions he said, then the exhaustion, then the willingness to let anything be done. ""And you better believe it will be.""
All his life he had been confronted by situations which were incapable of being solved, and there was a deliberateness behind all this, behind this changing of the card or door, because they would always wait until you had learned to jump at the certain card or door--the one with the circle--and then they would change it on you. There have been so many doors changed on me, he said, in the last twenty years, but it is now becoming clear that it is an impossible situation, and the question is whether to jump again, even though they ruffle you in the rump with a blast of air--to make you jump. He wished he wasn't standing by the Minipiano. First they would teach you the prayers and the Psalms, and that would be the right doorthe one with the circle and the long sweet words with the holy sound, and that would be the one to jump at to get where the food was. Then one day you jumped and it didn't give way, so that all you got was the bump on the nose, and the first bewilderment, the first young bewilderment.
I don't know whether to tell her about the door they substituted or not, he said, the one with the equation on it and the picture of the amoeba reproducing itself by division. Or the one with the photostatic copy of the check for thirty-two dollars and fifty cents. But the jumping was so long ago, although the bump is . . . how those old wounds hurt! Being crazy this way wouldn't be so bad if only, if only. If only when you put your foot forward to take a step, the ground wouldn't come up to meet your foot the way it does. And the same way in the street only I may never get back to the street unless I jump at the right door, the curb coming up to meet your foot, anticipating ever so delicately the weight of the body, which is somewhere else. ""We could take your name,"" she said, ""and send it to you."" And it wouldn't be so bad if only you could read a sentence all the way through without jumping your eye to something else on the same page; and then he kept thinking there was that man out in Jersey, the one who started to chop his trees down, one by one, the man who began talking about how he would take his house to pieces, brick by brick, because he faced a problem incapable of solution, probably, so he began to hack at the trees in the yard, began to pluck with trembling fingers at the bricks in the house. Even if a house is not washable, it is worth taking down. It is not till later that the exhaustion sets in.
But it is inevitable that they will keep changing the doors on you, he said, because that is what they are for; and the thing is to get used to it and not let it unsettle the mind. But that would mean not jumping, and you can't. Nobody can not jump. There will be no not-jumping. Among rats, perhaps, but among people never. Everybody has to keep jumping at a door the one with the circle on it because that is the way everybody is, especially some people. You wouldn't want me, standing here, to tell you, would you, about my friend the poet deceased who said, ""My heart has followed all my days something I cannot name""? It had the circle on it. And like many poets, although few so beloved, he is gone. It killed him, the jumping. First, of course, there were the preliminary bouts, the convulsions, and the calm and the willingness.
I remember the door with the picture of the girl on it only it was spring, her arms outstretched in loveliness, her dress it was the one with the circle on it uncaught, beginning the slow, clear, blinding cascade-and I guess we would all like to try that door again, for it seemed like the way and for a while it was the way, the door would open and you would go through winged and exalted like any rat and the food would be there, the way the Professor had it arranged, everything O.K., and you had chosen the right door for the world was young. The time they changed that door on me, my nose bled for a hundred hours--how do you like that, Madam? Or would you prefer to show me further through this so strange house, or you could take my name and send it to me, for although my heart has followed all my days something I cannot name, I am tired of the jumping and I do not know which way to go, Madam, and I am not even sure that I am not tired beyond the endurance of man rat, if you will and have taken leave of sanity. What are you following these days, old friend, after your recovery from the last bump? What is the name, or is it something you cannot name? The rats have a name for it by this time, perhaps, but I don't know what they call it. I call it and it comes in sheets, something like insulating board, unattainable and ugli-proof.
And there was the man out in Jersey, because I keep thinking about his terrible necessity and the passion and trouble he had gone to all those years in the indescribable abundance of a householder's detail, building the estate and the planting of the trees and in spring the lawn-dressing and in fall the bulbs for the spring burgeoning, and the watering of the grass on the long light evenings in summer and the gravel for the driveway all had to be thought out, planned and the decorative borders, probably, the perennials and the bug spray, and the building of the house from plans of the architect, first the sills, then the studs, then the full corn in the ear, the floors laid on the floor timbers, smoothed, and then the carpets upon the smooth floors and the curtains and the rods therefor. And then, almost without warning, he would be jumping at the same old door and it wouldn't give: they had changed it on him, making life no longer supportable under the elms in the elm shade, under the maples in the maple shade.
""Here you have the maximum of openness in a small room.""
It was impossible to say maybe it was the city what made him feel the way he did, and I am not the only one either, he kept thinking--ask any doctor if I am. The doctors, they know how many there are, they even know where the trouble is only they don't like to tell you about the prefrontal lobe because that means making a hole in your skull and removing the work of centuries. It took so long coming, this lobe, so many, many years. Is it something you read in the paper, perhaps? And now, the strain being so great, the door having been changed by the Professor once too often . . . but it only means a whiff of ether, a few deft strokes, and the higher animal becomes a little easier in his mind and more like the lower one. From now on, you see, that's the way it will be, the ones with the small prefrontal lobes will win because the other ones are hurt too much by this incessant bumping. They can stand just so much, em, Doctor? And what is that, pray, that you have in your hand? Still, you never can tell, em, Madam?
He crossed carefully the room, the thick carpet under him softly, and went toward the door carefully, which was glass and he could see himself in it, and which, at his approach, opened to allow him to pass through; and beyond he half expected to find one of the old doors that he had known, perhaps the one with the circle, the one with the girl her arms outstretched in loveliness and beauty before him. But he saw instead a moving stairway, and descended in light he kept thinking to the street below and to the other people. As he stepped off, the ground came up slightly, to meet his foot.","The story revolves around a protagonist who is constantly confused and disoriented by his surroundings. He is in a city that seems strange and unfamiliar to him, and he attributes this feeling to the names of things, which are frequently changing and inconsistent. The protagonist recalls the rats that were trained to jump at a card with a circle on it, which would sometimes give way and lead to food, but other times would not, causing the rats to go insane. He sees a parallel between himself and the rats, as he feels trapped and unable to find a solution to his own problems.

The protagonist is in a washable house, but he is unsure of its true nature. He is haunted by memories of doors and walls that would change on him, making it difficult for him to find the right path or access what he needs. He reflects on the exhaustion and willingness to accept anything that comes after experiencing convulsions and frantic racing.

The protagonist's mind is filled with thoughts of doors, equations, pictures, and memories of past experiences. He contemplates whether to share his struggles with someone else, but ultimately decides against it. He feels trapped and uncertain, unable to read a sentence without distraction and constantly jumping from one thought to another.

The protagonist mentions a man in Jersey who faced a problem he couldn't solve, leading him to destroy his own property in frustration. He ponders the inevitability of doors being changed and the need to adapt to these changes, even though it is unsettling. He believes that everyone is constantly jumping at doors, searching for solutions, and that not jumping is impossible.

The protagonist recalls a door with a picture of a girl on it, symbolizing hope and possibility. However, even that door eventually changed, leaving him with a sense of loss and bewilderment. He contemplates sharing his experiences with someone, but is unsure if he can articulate what he is going through.

The protagonist thinks about the man in Jersey again, admiring his dedication and effort in building a life, only to have it all crumble when faced with an unsolvable problem. He questions if the city is the cause of his confusion and wonders if doctors are aware of the number of people experiencing similar issues. He mentions the prefrontal lobe as a potential source of the problem but dismisses the idea of surgery to fix it.

In the end, the protagonist walks towards a glass door, seeing his reflection in it. As he passes through the door, he expects to find familiar surroundings but instead encounters a moving stairway. He descends and steps onto the street, feeling the ground meet his foot, symbolizing his return to reality and connection with other people.","The story revolves around a protagonist who is constantly confused and disoriented by his surroundings. He is in the city, where everything seems strange and different from what it should be. He finds it difficult to identify objects, as their names are constantly changing. For example, glass is referred to as tex or frequently koid, or as flex and oid, or duroid sand or flexsan duro. Similarly, he encounters walls that turn out to be doorways and vice versa.

The protagonist is also haunted by the memory of rats that were driven insane by being forced to solve impossible problems. He sees a parallel between his own confusion and the rats' frustration. He feels trapped in a washable house, unsure of which door or wall to jump at to find food. He is exhausted from constantly being tricked and deceived.

The protagonist recalls a friend who was a poet and eventually succumbed to the madness caused by the constant jumping. He himself is tired of the jumping and unsure of which way to go. He contemplates sharing his experiences with a woman he encounters, who offers to send him his name. He is disillusioned with the world and feels that his sanity is slipping away.

As the story progresses, the protagonist thinks about a man in New Jersey who faced a similar problem and started dismantling his house and chopping down his trees. He marvels at the man's dedication to destroying everything he had built. The protagonist contemplates the possibility of getting treatment for his condition but wonders if it is worth the risk.

The story ends with the protagonist leaving the washable house and descending a moving stairway to the street below. He feels the ground meet his foot and anticipates joining the other people in the city.",s68
The Dowry,Guy de Maupassant,"The marriage of Maitre Simon Lebrument with Mademoiselle Jeanne Cordier was a surprise to no one. Maitre Lebrument had bought out the practice of Maitre Papillon; naturally, he had to have money to pay for it; and Mademoiselle Jeanne Cordier had three hundred thousand francs clear in currency, and in bonds payable to bearer.
Maitre Lebrument was a handsome man. He was stylish, although in a provincial way; but, nevertheless, he was stylish--a rare thing at Boutigny-le-Rebours.
Mademoiselle Cordier was graceful and fresh-looking, although a trifle awkward; nevertheless, she was a handsome girl, and one to be desired.
The marriage ceremony turned all Boutigny topsy-turvy. Everybody admired the young couple, who quickly returned home to domestic felicity, having decided simply to take a short trip to Paris, after a few days of retirement.
This tete-a-tete was delightful, Maitre Lebrument having shown just the proper amount of delicacy. He had taken as his motto: ""Everything comes to him who waits."" He knew how to be at the same time patient and energetic. His success was rapid and complete.
After four days, Madame Lebrument adored her husband. She could not get along without him. She would sit on his knees, and taking him by the ears she would say: ""Open your mouth and shut your eyes."" He would open his mouth wide and partly close his eyes, and he would try to nip her fingers as she slipped some dainty between his teeth. Then she would give him a kiss, sweet and long, which would make chills run up and down his spine. And then, in his turn, he would not have enough caresses to please his wife from morning to night and from night to morning.
When the first week was over, he said to his young companion:
""If you wish, we will leave for Paris next Tuesday. We will be like two lovers, we will go to the restaurants, the theatres, the concert halls, everywhere, everywhere!""
She was ready to dance for joy.
""Oh! yes, yes. Let us go as soon as possible.""
He continued:
""And then, as we must forget nothing, ask your father to have your dowry ready; I shall pay Maitre Papillon on this trip.""
She answered:
""All right: I will tell him to-morrow morning.""
And he took her in his arms once more, to renew those sweet games of love which she had so enjoyed for the past week.
The following Tuesday, father-in-law and mother-in-law went to the station with their daughter and their son-in-law who were leaving for the capital.
The father-in-law said:
""I tell you it is very imprudent to carry so much money about in a pocketbook."" And the young lawyer smiled.
""Don't worry; I am accustomed to such things. You understand that, in my profession, I sometimes have as much as a million about me. In this manner, at least we avoid a great amount of red tape and delay. You needn't worry.""
The conductor was crying:
""All aboard for Paris!""
They scrambled into a car, where two old ladies were already seated.
Lebrument whispered into his wife's ear:
""What a bother! I won't be able to smoke.""
She answered in a low voice:
""It annoys me too, but not an account of your cigar.""
The whistle blew and the train started. The trip lasted about an hour, during which time they did not say very much to each other, as the two old ladies did not go to sleep.
As soon as they were in front of the Saint-Lazare Station, Maitre Lebrument said to his wife:
""Dearie, let us first go over to the Boulevard and get something to eat; then we can quietly return and get our trunk and bring it to the hotel.""
She immediately assented.
""Oh! yes. Let's eat at the restaurant. Is it far?""
He answered:
""Yes, it's quite a distance, but we will take the omnibus.""
She was surprised:
""Why don't we take a cab?""
He began to scold her smilingly:
""Is that the way you save money? A cab for a five minutes' ride at six cents a minute! You would deprive yourself of nothing.""
""That's so,"" she said, a little embarrassed.
A big omnibus was passing by, drawn by three big horses, which were trotting along. Lebrument called out:
""Conductor! Conductor!""
The heavy carriage stopped. And the young lawyer, pushing his wife, said to her quickly:
""Go inside; I'm going up on top, so that I may smoke at least one cigarette before lunch.""
She had no time to answer. The conductor, who had seized her by the arm to help her up the step, pushed her inside, and she fell into a seat, bewildered, looking through the back window at the feet of her husband as he climbed up to the top of the vehicle.
And she sat there motionless, between a fat man who smelled of cheap tobacco and an old woman who smelled of garlic.
All the other passengers were lined up in silence--a grocer's boy, a young girl, a soldier, a gentleman with gold-rimmed spectacles and a big silk hat, two ladies with a self-satisfied and crabbed look, which seemed to say: ""We are riding in this thing, but we don't have to,"" two sisters of charity and an undertaker. They looked like a collection of caricatures.
The jolting of the wagon made them wag their heads and the shaking of the wheels seemed to stupefy them--they all looked as though they were asleep.
The young woman remained motionless.
""Why didn't he come inside with me?"" she was saying to herself. An unaccountable sadness seemed to be hanging over her. He really need not have acted so.
The sisters motioned to the conductor to stop, and they got off one after the other, leaving in their wake the pungent smell of camphor. The bus started tip and soon stopped again. And in got a cook, red-faced and out of breath. She sat down and placed her basket of provisions on her knees. A strong odor of dish-water filled the vehicle.
""It's further than I imagined,"" thought Jeanne.
The undertaker went out, and was replaced by a coachman who seemed to bring the atmosphere of the stable with him. The young girl had as a successor a messenger, the odor of whose feet showed that he was continually walking.
The lawyer's wife began to feel ill at ease, nauseated, ready to cry without knowing why.
Other persons left and others entered. The stage went on through interminable streets, stopping at stations and starting again.
""How far it is!"" thought Jeanne. ""I hope he hasn't gone to sleep! He has been so tired the last few days.""
Little by little all the passengers left. She was left alone, all alone. The conductor cried:
""Vaugirard!""
Seeing that she did not move, he repeated:
""Vaugirard!""
She looked at him, understanding that he was speaking to her, as there was no one else there. For the third time the man said:
""Vaugirard!""
Then she asked:
""Where are we?""
He answered gruffly:
""We're at Vaugirard, of course! I have been yelling it for the last half hour!""
""Is it far from the Boulevard?"" she said.
""Which boulevard?""
""The Boulevard des Italiens.""
""We passed that a long time ago!""
""Would you mind telling my husband?""
""Your husband! Where is he?""
""On the top of the bus.""
""On the top! There hasn't been anybody there for a long time.""
She started, terrified.
""What? That's impossible! He got on with me. Look well! He must be there.""
The conductor was becoming uncivil:
""Come on, little one, you've talked enough! You can find ten men for every one that you lose. Now run along. You'll find another one somewhere.""
Tears were coming to her eyes. She insisted:
""But, monsieur, you are mistaken; I assure you that you must be mistaken. He had a big portfolio under his arm.""
The man began to laugh:
""A big portfolio! Oh, yes! He got off at the Madeleine. He got rid of you, all right! Ha! ha! ha!""
The stage had stopped. She got out and, in spite of herself, she looked up instinctively to the roof of the bus. It was absolutely deserted.
Then she began to cry, and, without thinking that anybody was listening or watching her, she said out loud:
""What is going to become of me?""
An inspector approached:
""What's the matter?""
The conductor answered, in a bantering tone of voice:
""It's a lady who got left by her husband during the trip.""
The other continued:
""Oh! that's nothing. You go about your business.""
Then he turned on his heels and walked away.
She began to walk straight ahead, too bewildered, too crazed even to understand what had happened to her. Where was she to go? What could she do? What could have happened to him? How could he have made such a mistake? How could he have been so forgetful?
She had two francs in her pocket. To whom could she go? Suddenly she remembered her cousin Barral, one of the assistants in the offices of the Ministry of the Navy.
She had just enough to pay for a cab. She drove to his house. He met her just as he was leaving for his office. He was carrying a large portfolio under his arm, just like Lebrument.
She jumped out of the carriage.
""Henry!"" she cried.
He stopped, astonished:
""Jeanne! Here--all alone! What are you doing? Where have you come from?""
Her eyes full of tears, she stammered:
""My husband has just got lost!""
""Lost! Where?""
""On an omnibus.""
""On an omnibus?""
Weeping, she told him her whole adventure.
He listened, thought, and then asked:
""Was his mind clear this morning?""
""Yes.""
""Good. Did he have much money with him?""
""Yes, he was carrying my dowry.""
""Your dowry! The whole of it?""
""The whole of it--in order to pay for the practice which he bought.""
""Well, my dear cousin, by this time your husband must be well on his way to Belgium.""
She could not understand. She kept repeating:
""My husband--you say--""
""I say that he has disappeared with your--your capital--that's all!""
She stood there, a prey to conflicting emotions, sobbing.
""Then he is--he is--he is a villain!""
And, faint from excitement, she leaned her head on her cousin's shoulder and wept.
As people were stopping to look at them, he pushed her gently into the vestibule of his house, and, supporting her with his arm around her waist, he led her up the stairs, and as his astonished servant opened the door, he ordered:
""Sophie, run to the restaurant and get a luncheon for two. I am not going to the office to-day.""","Maitre Simon Lebrument and Mademoiselle Jeanne Cordier get married in Boutigny-le-Rebours.

The Drunkard,Guy de Maupassant,"The north wind was blowing a hurricane, driving through the sky big, black, heavy clouds from which the rain poured down on the earth with terrific violence.
A high sea was raging and dashing its huge, slow, foamy waves along the coast with the rumbling sound of thunder. The waves followed each other close, rolling in as high as mountains, scattering the foam as they broke.
The storm engulfed itself in the little valley of Yport, whistling and moaning, tearing the shingles from the roofs, smashing the shutters, knocking down the chimneys, rushing through the narrow streets in such gusts that one could walk only by holding on to the walls, and children would have been lifted up like leaves and carried over the houses into the fields.
The fishing smacks had been hauled high up on land, because at high tide the sea would sweep the beach. Several sailors, sheltered behind the curved bottoms of their boats, were watching this battle of the sky and the sea.
Then, one by one, they went away, for night was falling on the storm, wrapping in shadows the raging ocean and all the battling elements.
Just two men remained, their hands plunged deep into their pockets, bending their backs beneath the squall, their woolen caps pulled down over their ears; two big Normandy fishermen, bearded, their skin tanned through exposure, with the piercing black eyes of the sailor who looks over the horizon like a bird of prey.
One of them was saying:
""Come on, Jeremie, let's go play dominoes. It's my treat.""
The other hesitated a while, tempted on one hand by the game and the thought of brandy, knowing well that, if he went to Paumelle's, he would return home drunk; held back, on the other hand, by the idea of his wife remaining alone in the house.
He asked:
""Any one might think that you had made a bet to get me drunk every night. Say, what good is it doing you, since it's always you that's treating?""
Nevertheless he was smiling at the idea of all this brandy drunk at the expense of another. He was smiling the contented smirk of an avaricious Norman.
Mathurin, his friend, kept pulling him by the sleeve.
""Come on, Jeremie. This isn't the kind of a night to go home without anything to warm you up. What are you afraid of? Isn't your wife going to warm your bed for you?""
Jeremie answered:
""The other night I couldn't find the door--I had to be fished out of the ditch in front of the house!""
He was still laughing at this drunkard's recollection, and he was unconsciously going toward Paumelle's Café, where a light was shining in the window; he was going, pulled by Mathurin and pushed by the wind, unable to resist these combined forces.
The low room was full of sailors, smoke and noise. All these men, clad in woolens, their elbows on the tables, were shouting to make themselves heard. The more people came in, the more one had to shout in order to overcome the noise of voices and the rattling of dominoes on the marble tables.
Jeremie and Mathurin sat down in a corner and began a game, and the glasses were emptied in rapid succession into their thirsty throats.
Then they played more games and drank more glasses. Mathurin kept pouring and winking to the saloon keeper, a big, red-faced man, who chuckled as though at the thought of some fine joke; and Jeremie kept absorbing alcohol and wagging his head, giving vent to a roar of laughter and looking at his comrade with a stupid and contented expression.
All the customers were going away. Every time that one of them would open the door to leave a gust of wind would blow into the café, making the tobacco smoke swirl around, swinging the lamps at the end of their chains and making their flames flicker, and suddenly one could hear the deep booming of a breaking wave and the moaning of the wind.
Jeremie, his collar unbuttoned, was taking drunkard's poses, one leg outstretched, one arm hanging down and in the other hand holding a domino.
They were alone now with the owner, who had come up to them, interested.
He asked:
""Well, Jeremie, how goes it inside? Feel less thirsty after wetting your throat?""
Jeremie muttered:
""The more I wet it, the drier it gets inside.""
The innkeeper cast a sly glance at Mathurin. He said:
""And your brother, Mathurin, where's he now?""
The sailor laughed silently:
""Don't worry; he's warm, all right.""
And both of them looked toward Jeremie, who was triumphantly putting down the double six and announcing:
""Game!""
Then the owner declared:
""Well, boys, I'm goin' to bed. I will leave you the lamp and the bottle; there's twenty cents' worth in it. Lock the door when you go, Mathurin, and slip the key under the mat the way you did the other night.""
Mathurin answered:
""Don't worry; it'll be all right.""
Paumelle shook hands with his two customers and slowly went up the wooden stairs. For several minutes his heavy step echoed through the little house. Then a loud creaking announced that he had got into bed.
The two men continued to play. From time to time a more violent gust of wind would shake the whole house, and the two drinkers would look up, as though some one were about to enter. Then Mathurin would take the bottle and fill Jeremie's glass. But suddenly the clock over the bar struck twelve. Its hoarse clang sounded like the rattling of saucepans. Then Mathurin got up like a sailor whose watch is over.
""Come on, Jeremie, we've got to get out.""
The other man rose to his feet with difficulty, got his balance by leaning on the table, reached the door and opened it while his companion was putting out the light.
As soon as they were in the street Mathurin locked the door and then said:
""Well, so long. See you to-morrow night!""
And he disappeared in the darkness.
Jeremie took a few steps, staggered, stretched out his hands, met a wall which supported him and began to stumble along. From time to time a gust of wind would sweep through the street, pushing him forward, making him run for a few steps; then, when the wind would die down, he would stop short, having lost his impetus, and once more he would begin to stagger on his unsteady drunkard's legs.
He went instinctively toward his home, just as birds go to their nests. Finally he recognized his door, and began to feel about for the keyhole and tried to put the key in it. Not finding the hole, he began to swear. Then he began to beat on the door with his fists, calling for his wife to come and help him:
""Melina! Oh, Melina!""
As he leaned against the door for support, it gave way and opened, and Jeremie, losing his prop, fell inside, rolling on his face into the middle of his room, and he felt something heavy pass over him and escape in the night.
He was no longer moving, dazed by fright, bewildered, fearing the devil, ghosts, all the mysterious beings of darkness, and he waited a long time without daring to move. But when he found out that nothing else was moving, a little reason returned to him, the reason of a drunkard.
Gently he sat up. Again he waited a long time, and at last, growing bolder, he called:
""Melina!""
His wife did not answer.
Then, suddenly, a suspicion crossed his darkened mind, an indistinct, vague suspicion. He was not moving; he was sitting there in the dark, trying to gather together his scattered wits, his mind stumbling over incomplete ideas, just as his feet stumbled along.
Once more he asked:
""Who was it, Melina? Tell me who it was. I won't hurt you!""
He waited, no voice was raised in the darkness. He was now reasoning with himself out loud.
""I'm drunk, all right! I'm drunk! And he filled me up, the dog; he did it, to stop my goin' home. I'm drunk!""
And he would continue:
""Tell me who it was, Melina, or somethin'll happen to you.""
After having waited again, he went on with the slow and obstinate logic of a drunkard:
""He's been keeping me at that loafer Paumelle's place every night, so as to stop my going home. It's some trick. Oh, you damned carrion!""
Slowly he got on his knees. A blind fury was gaining possession of him, mingling with the fumes of alcohol.
He continued:
""Tell me who it was, Melina, or you'll get a licking--I warn you!""
He was now standing, trembling with a wild fury, as though the alcohol had set his blood on fire. He took a step, knocked against a chair, seized it, went on, reached the bed, ran his hands over it and felt the warm body of his wife.
Then, maddened, he roared:
""So! You were there, you piece of dirt, and you wouldn't answer!""
And, lifting the chair, which he was holding in his strong sailor's grip, he swung it down before him with an exasperated fury. A cry burst from the bed, an agonizing, piercing cry. Then he began to thrash around like a thresher in a barn. And soon nothing more moved. The chair was broken to pieces, but he still held one leg and beat away with it, panting.
At last he stopped to ask:
""Well, are you ready to tell me who it was?""
Melina did not answer.
Then tired out, stupefied from his exertion, he stretched himself out on the ground and slept.
When day came a neighbor, seeing the door open, entered. He saw Jeremie snoring on the floor, amid the broken pieces of a chair, and on the bed a pulp of flesh and blood.","In a small coastal village, a violent storm rages, causing havoc and destruction. Two fishermen, Jeremie and Mathurin, seek refuge in a local cafe. Mathurin tempts Jeremie to stay and play dominoes, offering to pay for the drinks. Jeremie is hesitant, knowing that he will return home drunk and leave his wife alone. However, he eventually gives in to the temptation and they spend the night drinking and playing games. The owner of the cafe eventually retires to bed, leaving Jeremie and Mathurin alone with the bottle of alcohol. When the clock strikes midnight, Mathurin insists they leave, and they part ways outside. Jeremie stumbles towards his home, inebriated and struggling against the strong winds. He eventually reaches his front door and tries to unlock it, but fails. Frustrated, he calls out for his wife to help him. As he leans against the door, it suddenly opens, and Jeremie falls inside. In the darkness, he senses something heavy passing over him and escaping into the night. Fearful and bewildered, Jeremie remains still for a while before mustering the courage to call out for his wife. When she doesn't respond, a suspicion grows in his mind. He becomes enraged and threatens his wife, demanding to know who was with her. As he grows more agitated, he discovers his wife's lifeless body on the bed. Consumed by fury, Jeremie beats her with a chair until she no longer moves. Exhausted, he falls asleep on the floor. The next morning, a neighbor discovers the gruesome scene.","In a small fishing village, a violent storm rages. The wind is howling, rain is pouring, and the sea is churning with massive waves. As the storm intensifies, two rugged fishermen, Jeremie and Mathurin, take refuge in a local café. Mathurin convinces Jeremie to join him in playing dominoes and drinking brandy. They continue to drink and play as the storm rages outside, oblivious to the customers leaving and the innkeeper retiring for the night.

After hours of drinking, Mathurin decides it's time to leave. Jeremie struggles to stand and walk, but Mathurin locks the café door and disappears into the darkness. Jeremie stumbles his way home, calling for his wife, Melina, to help him open the door. When the door finally gives way, Jeremie falls inside, and upon regaining his senses, realizes that someone has been in his home.

In a drunken rage, Jeremie demands to know who was in his house and begins searching for his wife. When he finds her lying motionless on the bed, he becomes even angrier and violently attacks her, using a chair as a weapon. After the brutal assault, Jeremie falls asleep on the floor.

The next morning, a neighbor discovers the scene and sees Jeremie asleep on the floor surrounded by broken furniture. Melina's lifeless body lies on the bed, beaten beyond recognition.",s70
A Family,Guy de Maupassant,"I was to see my old friend, Simon Radevin, of whom I had lost sight for fifteen years. At one time he was my most intimate friend, the friend who knows one's thoughts, with whom one passes long, quiet, happy evenings, to whom one tells one's secret love affairs, and who seems to draw out those rare, ingenious, delicate thoughts born of that sympathy that gives a sense of repose.
For years we had scarcely been separated; we had lived, travelled, thought and dreamed together; had liked the same things, had admired the same books, understood the same authors, trembled with the same sensations, and very often laughed at the same individuals, whom we understood completely by merely exchanging a glance.
Then he married. He married, quite suddenly, a little girl from the provinces, who had come to Paris in search of a husband. How in the world could that little thin, insipidly fair girl, with her weak hands, her light, vacant eyes, and her clear, silly voice, who was exactly like a hundred thousand marriageable dolls, have picked up that intelligent, clever young fellow? Can any one understand these things? No doubt he had hoped for happiness, simple, quiet and long-enduring happiness, in the arms of a good, tender and faithful woman; he had seen all that in the transparent looks of that schoolgirl with light hair.
He had not dreamed of the fact that an active, living and vibrating man grows weary of everything as soon as he understands the stupid reality, unless, indeed, he becomes so brutalized that he understands nothing whatever.
What would he be like when I met him again? Still lively, witty, light- hearted and enthusiastic, or in a state of mental torpor induced by provincial life? A man may change greatly in the course of fifteen years!
The train stopped at a small station, and as I got out of the carriage, a stout, a very stout man with red cheeks and a big stomach rushed up to me with open arms, exclaiming: ""George!"" I embraced him, but I had not recognized him, and then I said, in astonishment: ""By Jove! You have not grown thin!"" And he replied with a laugh:
""What did you expect? Good living, a good table and good nights! Eating and sleeping, that is my existence!""
I looked at him closely, trying to discover in that broad face the features I held so dear. His eyes alone had not changed, but I no longer saw the same expression in them, and I said to myself: ""If the expression be the reflection of the mind, the thoughts in that head are not what they used to be formerly; those thoughts which I knew so well.""
Yet his eyes were bright, full of happiness and friendship, but they had not that clear, intelligent expression which shows as much as words the brightness of the intellect. Suddenly he said:
""Here are my two eldest children."" A girl of fourteen, who was almost a woman, and a boy of thirteen, in the dress of a boy from a Lycee, came forward in a hesitating and awkward manner, and I said in a low voice: ""Are they yours?"" ""Of course they are,"" he replied, laughing. ""How many have you?"" ""Five! There are three more at home.""
He said this in a proud, self-satisfied, almost triumphant manner, and I felt profound pity, mingled with a feeling of vague contempt, for this vainglorious and simple reproducer of his species.
I got into a carriage which he drove himself, and we set off through the town, a dull, sleepy, gloomy town where nothing was moving in the streets except a few dogs and two or three maidservants. Here and there a shopkeeper, standing at his door, took off his hat, and Simon returned his salute and told me the man's name; no doubt to show me that he knew all the inhabitants personally, and the thought struck me that he was thinking of becoming a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies, that dream of all those who bury themselves in the provinces.
We were soon out of the town, and the carriage turned into a garden that was an imitation of a park, and stopped in front of a turreted house, which tried to look like a chateau.
""That is my den,"" said Simon, so that I might compliment him on it. ""It is charming,"" I replied.
A lady appeared on the steps, dressed for company, and with company phrases all ready prepared. She was no longer the light-haired, insipid girl I had seen in church fifteen years previously, but a stout lady in curls and flounces, one of those ladies of uncertain age, without intellect, without any of those things that go to make a woman. In short, she was a mother, a stout, commonplace mother, a human breeding machine which procreates without any other preoccupation but her children and her cook-book.
She welcomed me, and I went into the hall, where three children, ranged according to their height, seemed set out for review, like firemen before a mayor, and I said: ""Ah! ah! so there are the others?"" Simon, radiant with pleasure, introduced them: ""Jean, Sophie and Gontran.""
The door of the drawing-room was open. I went in, and in the depths of an easy-chair, I saw something trembling, a man, an old, paralyzed man. Madame Radevin came forward and said: ""This is my grandfather, monsieur; he is eighty-seven."" And then she shouted into the shaking old man's ears: ""This is a friend of Simon's, papa."" The old gentleman tried to say ""good-day"" to me, and he muttered: ""Oua, oua, oua,"" and waved his hand, and I took a seat saying: ""You are very kind, monsieur.""
Simon had just come in, and he said with a laugh: ""So! You have made grandpapa's acquaintance. He is a treasure, that old man; he is the delight of the children. But he is so greedy that he almost kills himself at every meal; you have no idea what he would eat if he were allowed to do as he pleased. But you will see, you will see. He looks at all the sweets as if they were so many girls. You never saw anything so funny; you will see presently.""
I was then shown to my room, to change my dress for dinner, and hearing a great clatter behind me on the stairs, I turned round and saw that all the children were following me behind their father; to do me honor, no doubt.
My windows looked out across a dreary, interminable plain, an ocean of grass, of wheat and of oats, without a clump of trees or any rising ground, a striking and melancholy picture of the life which they must be leading in that house.
A bell rang; it was for dinner, and I went downstairs. Madame Radevin took my arm in a ceremonious manner, and we passed into the dining-room. A footman wheeled in the old man in his armchair. He gave a greedy and curious look at the dessert, as he turned his shaking head with difficulty from one dish to the other.
Simon rubbed his hands: ""You will be amused,"" he said; and all the children understanding that I was going to be indulged with the sight of their greedy grandfather, began to laugh, while their mother merely smiled and shrugged her shoulders, and Simon, making a speaking trumpet of his hands, shouted at the old man: ""This evening there is sweet creamed rice!"" The wrinkled face of the grandfather brightened, and he trembled more violently, from head to foot, showing that he had understood and was very pleased. The dinner began.
""Just look!"" Simon whispered. The old man did not like the soup, and refused to eat it; but he was obliged to do it for the good of his health, and the footman forced the spoon into his mouth, while the old man blew so energetically, so as not to swallow the soup, that it was scattered like a spray all over the table and over his neighbors. The children writhed with laughter at the spectacle, while their father, who was also amused, said: ""Is not the old man comical?""
During the whole meal they were taken up solely with him. He devoured the dishes on the table with his eyes, and tried to seize them and pull them over to him with his trembling hands. They put them almost within his reach, to see his useless efforts, his trembling clutches at them, the piteous appeal of his whole nature, of his eyes, of his mouth and of his nose as he smelt them, and he slobbered on his table napkin with eagerness, while uttering inarticulate grunts. And the whole family was highly amused at this horrible and grotesque scene.
Then they put a tiny morsel on his plate, and he ate with feverish gluttony, in order to get something more as soon as possible, and when the sweetened rice was brought in, he nearly had a fit, and groaned with greediness, and Gontran called out to him:
""You have eaten too much already; you can have no more."" And they pretended not to give him any. Then he began to cry; he cried and trembled more violently than ever, while all the children laughed. At last, however, they gave him his helping, a very small piece; and as he ate the first mouthful, he made a comical noise in his throat, and a movement with his neck as ducks do when they swallow too large a morsel, and when he had swallowed it, he began to stamp his feet, so as to get more.
I was seized with pity for this saddening and ridiculous Tantalus, and interposed on his behalf:
""Come, give him a little more rice!"" But Simon replied: ""Oh! no, my dear fellow, if he were to eat too much, it would harm him, at his age.""
I held my tongue, and thought over those words. Oh, ethics! Oh, logic! Oh, wisdom! At his age! So they deprived him of his only remaining pleasure out of regard for his health! His health! What would he do with it, inert and trembling wreck that he was? They were taking care of his life, so they said. His life? How many days? Ten, twenty, fifty, or a hundred? Why? For his own sake? Or to preserve for some time longer the spectacle of his impotent greediness in the family.
There was nothing left for him to do in this life, nothing whatever. He had one single wish left, one sole pleasure; why not grant him that last solace until he died?
After we had played cards for a long time, I went up to my room and to bed; I was low-spirited and sad, sad, sad! and I sat at my window. Not a sound could be heard outside but the beautiful warbling of a bird in a tree, somewhere in the distance. No doubt the bird was singing in a low voice during the night, to lull his mate, who was asleep on her eggs. And I thought of my poor friend's five children, and pictured him to myself, snoring by the side of his ugly wife.","The narrator goes to visit his old friend, Simon Radevin, whom he hasn't seen in fifteen years. They used to be close friends, but Simon got married and moved to the provinces. The narrator wonders how Simon has changed and what his life is like now.

When the narrator arrives, he is surprised to see that Simon has become very overweight and seems content with a life focused on eating and sleeping. Simon introduces his wife, who has become a typical, dull mother, and their five children. The family lives in a dull and gloomy town, and their house tries to imitate a grand chateau.

Simon's children follow the narrator around, as if to honor him. The narrator's room overlooks a plain, symbolizing the monotonous life in the house. During dinner, the family focuses on Simon's elderly, paralyzed grandfather, who is greedy and unable to eat properly. They find entertainment in watching him struggle to eat and deny him more food for the sake of his health.

The narrator feels pity for the grandfather and questions the family's logic in depriving him of his only pleasure in life. He reflects on the meaninglessness of preserving his life when he has no enjoyment left. The narrator ends the day feeling sad and imagines Simon snoring next to his unattractive wife.","The protagonist of the story is visiting his old friend, Simon Radevin, whom he hasn't seen in fifteen years.

Farewell,Guy de Maupassant,"The two friends were getting near the end of their dinner. Through the café windows they could see the Boulevard, crowded with people. They could feel the gentle breezes which are wafted over Paris on warm summer evenings and make you feel like going out somewhere, you care not where, under the trees, and make you dream of moonlit rivers, of fireflies and of larks.
One of the two, Henri Simon, heaved a deep sigh and said:
""Ah! I am growing old. It's sad. Formerly, on evenings like this, I felt full of life. Now, I only feel regrets. Life is short!""
He was perhaps forty-five years old, very bald and already growing stout.
The other, Pierre Carnier, a trifle older, but thin and lively, answered:
""Well, my boy, I have grown old without noticing it in the least. I have always been merry, healthy, vigorous and all the rest. As one sees oneself in the mirror every day, one does not realize the work of age, for it is slow, regular, and it modifies the countenance so gently that the changes are unnoticeable. It is for this reason alone that we do not die of sorrow after two or three years of excitement. For we cannot understand the alterations which time produces. In order to appreciate them one would have to remain six months without seeing one's own face-- then, oh, what a shock!
""And the women, my friend, how I pity the poor beings! All their joy, all their power, all their life, lies in their beauty, which lasts ten years.
""As I said, I aged without noticing it; I thought myself practically a youth, when I was almost fifty years old. Not feeling the slightest infirmity, I went about, happy and peaceful.
""The revelation of my decline came to me in a simple and terrible manner, which overwhelmed me for almost six months--then I became resigned.
""Like all men, I have often been in love, but most especially once.
""I met her at the seashore, at Etretat, about twelve years ago, shortly after the war. There is nothing prettier than this beach during the morning bathing hour. It is small, shaped like a horseshoe, framed by high while cliffs, which are pierced by strange holes called the 'Portes,' one stretching out into the ocean like the leg of a giant, the other short and dumpy. The women gather on the narrow strip of sand in this frame of high rocks, which they make into a gorgeous garden of beautiful gowns. The sun beats down on the shores, on the multicolored parasols, on the blue-green sea; and all is gay, delightful, smiling. You sit down at the edge of the water and you watch the bathers. The women come down, wrapped in long bath robes, which they throw off daintily when they reach the foamy edge of the rippling waves; and they run into the water with a rapid little step, stopping from time to time for a delightful little thrill from the cold water, a short gasp.
""Very few stand the test of the bath. It is there that they can be judged, from the ankle to the throat. Especially on leaving the water are the defects revealed, although water is a powerful aid to flabby skin.
""The first time that I saw this young woman in the water, I was delighted, entranced. She stood the test well. There are faces whose charms appeal to you at first glance and delight you instantly. You seem to have found the woman whom you were born to love. I had that feeling and that shock.
""I was introduced, and was soon smitten worse than I had ever been before. My heart longed for her. It is a terrible yet delightful thing thus to be dominated by a young woman. It is almost torture, and yet infinite delight. Her look, her smile, her hair fluttering in the wind, the little lines of her face, the slightest movement of her features, delighted me, upset me, entranced me. She had captured me, body and soul, by her gestures, her manners, even by her clothes, which seemed to take on a peculiar charm as soon as she wore them. I grew tender at the sight of her veil on some piece of furniture, her gloves thrown on a chair. Her gowns seemed to me inimitable. Nobody had hats like hers.
""She was married, but her husband came only on Saturday, and left on Monday. I didn't concern myself about him, anyhow. I wasn't jealous of him, I don't know why; never did a creature seem to me to be of less importance in life, to attract my attention less than this man.
""But she! how I loved her! How beautiful, graceful and young she was! She was youth, elegance, freshness itself! Never before had I felt so strongly what a pretty, distinguished, delicate, charming, graceful being woman is. Never before had I appreciated the seductive beauty to be found in the curve of a cheek, the movement of a lip, the pinkness of an ear, the shape of that foolish organ called the nose.
""This lasted three months; then I left for America, overwhelmed with sadness. But her memory remained in me, persistent, triumphant. From far away I was as much hers as I had been when she was near me. Years passed by, and I did not forget her. The charming image of her person was ever before my eyes and in my heart. And my love remained true to her, a quiet tenderness now, something like the beloved memory of the most beautiful and the most enchanting thing I had ever met in my life.
""Twelve years are not much in a lifetime! One does not feel them slip by. The years follow each other gently and quickly, slowly yet rapidly, each one is long and yet so soon over! They add up so rapidly, they leave so few traces behind them, they disappear so completely, that, when one turns round to look back over bygone years, one sees nothing and yet one does not understand how one happens to be so old. It seemed to me, really, that hardly a few months separated me from that charming season on the sands of Etretat.
""Last spring I went to dine with some friends at Maisons-Laffitte.
""Just as the train was leaving, a big, fat lady, escorted by four little girls, got into my car. I hardly looked at this mother hen, very big, very round, with a face as full as the moon framed in an enormous, beribboned hat.
""She was puffing, out of breath from having been forced to walk quickly. The children began to chatter. I unfolded my paper and began to read.
""We had just passed Asnieres, when my neighbor suddenly turned to me and said:
""'Excuse me, sir, but are you not Monsieur Garnier?'
""'Yes, madame.'
""Then she began to laugh, the pleased laugh of a good woman; and yet it was sad.
""'You do not seem to recognize me.'
""I hesitated. It seemed to me that I had seen that face somewhere; but where? when? I answered:
""'Yes--and no. I certainly know you, and yet I cannot recall your name.'
""She blushed a little:
""'Madame Julie Lefevre.'
""Never had I received such a shock. In a second it seemed to me as though it were all over with me! I felt that a veil had been torn from my eyes and that I was going to make a horrible and heartrending discovery.
""So that was she! That big, fat, common woman, she! She had become the mother of these four girls since I had last seen her. And these little beings surprised me as much as their mother. They were part of her; they were big girls, and already had a place in life. Whereas she no longer counted, she, that marvel of dainty and charming gracefulness. It seemed to me that I had seen her but yesterday, and this is how I found her again! Was it possible? A poignant grief seized my heart; and also a revolt against nature herself, an unreasoning indignation against this brutal, injurious act of destruction.
""I looked at her, bewildered. Then I took her hand in mine, and tears came to my eyes. I wept for her lost youth. For I did not know this fat lady.
""She was also excited, and stammered:
""'I am greatly changed, am I not? What can you expect--everything has its time! You see, I have become a mother, nothing but a good mother. Farewell to the rest, that is over. Oh! I never expected you to recognize me if we met. You, too, have changed. It took me quite a while to be sure that I was not mistaken. Your hair is all white. Just think! Twelve years ago! Twelve years! My oldest girl is already ten.'
""I looked at the child. And I recognized in her something of her mother's old charm, but something as yet unformed, something which promised for the future. And life seemed to me as swift as a passing train.
""We had reached Maisons-Laffitte. I kissed my old friend's hand. I had found nothing to utter but the most commonplace remarks. I was too much upset to talk.
""At night, alone, at home, I stood in front of the mirror for a long time, a very long time. And I finally remembered what I had been, finally saw in my mind's eye my brown mustache, my black hair and the youthful expression of my face. Now I was old.

The gift of the magi,O. Henry,"One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.

There was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.

While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.

In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name “Mr. James Dillingham Young.”

The “Dillingham” had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called “Jim” and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.

Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn’t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling—something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.

There was a pier glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.

Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.

Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim’s gold watch that had been his father’s and his grandfather’s. The other was Della’s hair. Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty’s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.

So now Della’s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.

On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.

Where she stopped the sign read: “Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds.” One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the “Sofronie.”

“Will you buy my hair?” asked Della.

“I buy hair,” said Madame. “Take yer hat off and let’s have a sight at the looks of it.”

Down rippled the brown cascade.

“Twenty dollars,” said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.

“Give it to me quick,” said Della.

Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim’s present.

She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation—as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim’s. It was like him. Quietness and value—the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.

When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends—a mammoth task.

Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.

“If Jim doesn’t kill me,” she said to herself, “before he takes a second look at me, he’ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do—oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?”

At 7 o’clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.

Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: “Please God, make him think I am still pretty.”

The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two—and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.

Jim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.

Della wriggled off the table and went for him.

“Jim, darling,” she cried, “don’t look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold because I couldn’t have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It’ll grow out again—you won’t mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say ‘Merry Christmas!’ Jim, and let’s be happy. You don’t know what a nice—what a beautiful, nice gift I’ve got for you.”

“You’ve cut off your hair?” asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.

“Cut it off and sold it,” said Della. “Don’t you like me just as well, anyhow? I’m me without my hair, ain’t I?”

Jim looked about the room curiously.

“You say your hair is gone?” he said, with an air almost of idiocy.

“You needn’t look for it,” said Della. “It’s sold, I tell you—sold and gone, too. It’s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,” she went on with sudden serious sweetness, “but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?”

Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year—what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.

Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.

“Don’t make any mistake, Dell,” he said, “about me. I don’t think there’s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you’ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first.”

White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.

For there lay The Combs—the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rims—just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.

But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: “My hair grows so fast, Jim!”

And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, “Oh, oh!”

Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.

“Isn’t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You’ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it.”

Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.

“Dell,” said he, “let’s put our Christmas presents away and keep ’em a while. They’re too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.”

The magi, as you know, were wise men—wonderfully wise men—who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.","The story begins with Della, who has saved up one dollar and eighty-seven cents, with the intention of buying a Christmas present for her husband, Jim. She is disappointed by the small amount of money she has, as she had been hoping to buy something special for Jim. Della and Jim live in a small, modest apartment and are facing financial difficulties.

Della decides to sell her most prized possession, her long, beautiful hair, in order to buy a gift for Jim. She goes to a hair salon and sells her hair for twenty dollars. With the money, she finds the perfect gift for Jim - a platinum fob chain for his watch. The chain is expensive, costing twenty-one dollars, leaving Della with only eighty-seven cents.

Della rushes back home and prepares for Jim's arrival. When he comes home, she reveals her new haircut to him, explaining that she sold her hair to buy him a gift. Jim, however, surprises Della by showing her the gift he bought for her - a set of combs for her now-short hair. Della is initially devastated that she no longer has her long hair to wear the combs with, but quickly realizes that her hair will grow back.

Jim confesses that he sold his watch to buy the combs, and suggests that they put their gifts away for now and enjoy a simple meal together. The story concludes by comparing Della and Jim to the wise men, or magi, from the biblical story of the birth of Jesus, implying that their sacrificial love for each other makes them truly wise.","Della and her husband, Jim, are a young couple living in a small, shabby apartment.

A Haunted House,Virginia Woolf,"Whatever hour you woke there was a door shutting. From room to room they went, hand in hand, lifting here, opening there, making sure--a ghostly couple.
""Here we left it,"" she said. And he added, ""Oh, but here tool"" ""It's upstairs,"" she murmured. ""And in the garden,"" he whispered. ""Quietly,"" they said, ""or we shall wake them.""
But it wasn't that you woke us. Oh, no. ""They're looking for it; they're drawing the curtain,"" one might say, and so read on a page or two. ""Now they've found it,' one would be certain, stopping the pencil on the margin. And then, tired of reading, one might rise and see for oneself, the house all empty, the doors standing open, only the wood pigeons bubbling with content and the hum of the threshing machine sounding from the farm. ""What did I come in here for? What did I want to find?"" My hands were empty. ""Perhaps its upstairs then?"" The apples were in the loft. And so down again, the garden still as ever, only the book had slipped into the grass.
But they had found it in the drawing room. Not that one could ever see them. The windowpanes reflected apples, reflected roses; all the leaves were green in the glass. If they moved in the drawing room, the apple only turned its yellow side. Yet, the moment after, if the door was opened, spread about the floor, hung upon the walls, pendant from the ceiling--what? My hands were empty. The shadow of a thrush crossed the carpet; from the deepest wells of silence the wood pigeon drew its bubble of sound. ""Safe, safe, safe"" the pulse of the house beat softly. ""The treasure buried; the room . . ."" the pulse stopped short. Oh, was that the buried treasure?
A moment later the light had faded. Out in the garden then? But the trees spun darkness for a wandering beam of sun. So fine, so rare, coolly sunk beneath the surface the beam I sought always burned behind the glass. Death was the glass; death was between us, coming to the woman first, hundreds of years ago, leaving the house, sealing all the windows; the rooms were darkened. He left it, left her, went North, went East, saw the stars turned in the Southern sky; sought the house, found it dropped beneath the Downs. ""Safe, safe, safe,"" the pulse of the house beat gladly. 'The Treasure yours.""
The wind roars up the avenue. Trees stoop and bend this way and that. Moonbeams splash and spill wildly in the rain. But the beam of the lamp falls straight from the window. The candle burns stiff and still. Wandering through the house, opening the windows, whispering not to wake us, the ghostly couple seek their joy.
""Here we slept,"" she says. And he adds, ""Kisses without number."" ""Waking in the morning--"" ""Silver between the trees--"" ""Upstairs--"" 'In the garden--"" ""When summer came--"" 'In winter snowtime--"" ""The doors go shutting far in the distance, gently knocking like the pulse of a heart.
Nearer they come, cease at the doorway. The wind falls, the rain slides silver down the glass. Our eyes darken, we hear no steps beside us; we see no lady spread her ghostly cloak. His hands shield the lantern. ""Look,"" he breathes. ""Sound asleep. Love upon their lips.""
Stooping, holding their silver lamp above us, long they look and deeply. Long they pause. The wind drives straightly; the flame stoops slightly. Wild beams of moonlight cross both floor and wall, and, meeting, stain the faces bent; the faces pondering; the faces that search the sleepers and seek their hidden joy.
""Safe, safe, safe,"" the heart of the house beats proudly. ""Long years--"" he sighs. ""Again you found me."" ""Here,"" she murmurs, ""sleeping; in the garden reading; laughing, rolling apples in the loft. Here we left our treasure--"" Stooping, their light lifts the lids upon my eyes. ""Safe! safe! safe!"" the pulse of the house beats wildly. Waking, I cry ""Oh, is this your buried treasure? The light in the heart.""","The story begins with a ghostly couple moving from room to room in a house, searching for something. They communicate in whispers and are cautious not to wake anyone. However, the narrator explains that it is not their presence that wakes them, but rather the couple's actions that draw attention.

The couple is searching for an elusive object, and the narrator imagines what they might be thinking as they search. The narrator muses about the possibility of the object being upstairs or in the garden, but eventually realizes that the couple has found it in the drawing room. The couple remains unseen, but their presence is felt through the reflections in the windowpanes and the movement of objects in the room.

As the narrator continues to search for the object, they feel a sense of darkness and death that separates them from the couple. The narrator reflects on the history of the house, where the woman was left behind while the man ventured out and eventually returned to find her. The pulse of the house assures them that the treasure is safe.

The scene shifts to the garden, where the wind and rain create a chaotic atmosphere. However, the beam of light from a window remains steady, and the couple wanders through the house without disturbing anyone. They reminisce about their time together, recalling moments of joy and love.

As the couple approaches the narrator, the atmosphere becomes still and quiet. The wind and rain subside, and the couple shines a light on the sleeping narrator. They observe the sleepers, searching for their hidden joy. The heart of the house beats proudly, assuring that everything is safe.

Finally, the narrator wakes up and questions whether the couple's buried treasure is the light in their heart.

The Lottery Ticket,Anton Pavlovich Chekhov,"Ivan Dmitritch, a middle-class man who lived with his family on an income of twelve hundred a year and was very well satisfied with his lot, sat down on the sofa after supper and began reading the newspaper.
""I forgot to look at the newspaper today,"" his wife said to him as she cleared the table. ""Look and see whether the list of drawings is there.""
""Yes, it is,"" said Ivan Dmitritch; ""but hasn't your ticket lapsed?""
""No; I took the interest on Tuesday.""
""What is the number?""
""Series 9,499, number 26.""
""All right . . . we will look . . . 9,499 and 26.""
Ivan Dmitritch had no faith in lottery luck, and would not, as a rule, have consented to look at the lists of winning numbers, but now, as he had nothing else to do and as the newspaper was before his eyes, he passed his finger downwards along the column of numbers. And immediately, as though in mockery of his scepticism, no further than the second line from the top, his eye was caught by the figure 9,499! Unable to believe his eyes, he hurriedly dropped the paper on his knees without looking to see the number of the ticket, and, just as though some one had given him a douche of cold water, he felt an agreeable chill in the pit of the stomach; tingling and terrible and sweet!
""Masha, 9,499 is there!"" he said in a hollow voice.
His wife looked at his astonished and panicstricken face, and realized that he was not joking.
""9,499?"" she asked, turning pale and dropping the folded tablecloth on the table.
""Yes, yes . . . it really is there!""
""And the number of the ticket?""
""Oh yes! There's the number of the ticket too. But stay . . . wait! No, I say! Anyway, the number of our series is there! Anyway, you understand....""
Looking at his wife, Ivan Dmitritch gave a broad, senseless smile, like a baby when a bright object is shown it. His wife smiled too; it was as pleasant to her as to him that he only mentioned the series, and did not try to find out the number of the winning ticket. To torment and tantalize oneself with hopes of possible fortune is so sweet, so thrilling!
""It is our series,"" said Ivan Dmitritch, after a long silence. ""So there is a probability that we have won. It's only a probability, but there it is!""
""Well, now look!""
""Wait a little. We have plenty of time to be disappointed. It's on the second line from the top, so the prize is seventy-five thousand. That's not money, but power, capital! And in a minute I shall look at the list, and there--26! Eh? I say, what if we really have won?""
The husband and wife began laughing and staring at one another in silence. The possibility of winning bewildered them; they could not have said, could not have dreamed, what they both needed that seventy-five thousand for, what they would buy, where they would go. They thought only of the figures 9,499 and 75,000 and pictured them in their imagination, while somehow they could not think of the happiness itself which was so possible.
Ivan Dmitritch, holding the paper in his hand, walked several times from corner to corner, and only when he had recovered from the first impression began dreaming a little.
""And if we have won,"" he said--""why, it will be a new life, it will be a transformation! The ticket is yours, but if it were mine I should, first of all, of course, spend twenty-five thousand on real property in the shape of an estate; ten thousand on immediate expenses, new furnishing . . . travelling . . . paying debts, and so on. . . . The other forty thousand I would put in the bank and get interest on it.""
""Yes, an estate, that would be nice,"" said his wife, sitting down and dropping her hands in her lap.
""Somewhere in the Tula or Oryol provinces. . . . In the first place we shouldn't need a summer villa, and besides, it would always bring in an income.""
And pictures came crowding on his imagination, each more gracious and poetical than the last. And in all these pictures he saw himself well-fed, serene, healthy, felt warm, even hot! Here, after eating a summer soup, cold as ice, he lay on his back on the burning sand close to a stream or in the garden under a lime-tree. . . . It is hot. . . . His little boy and girl are crawling about near him, digging in the sand or catching ladybirds in the grass. He dozes sweetly, thinking of nothing, and feeling all over that he need not go to the office today, tomorrow, or the day after. Or, tired of lying still, he goes to the hayfield, or to the forest for mushrooms, or watches the peasants catching fish with a net. When the sun sets he takes a towel and soap and saunters to the bathing shed, where he undresses at his leisure, slowly rubs his bare chest with his hands, and goes into the water. And in the water, near the opaque soapy circles, little fish flit to and fro and green water-weeds nod their heads. After bathing there is tea with cream and milk rolls. . . . In the evening a walk or vint with the neighbors.
""Yes, it would be nice to buy an estate,"" said his wife, also dreaming, and from her face it was evident that she was enchanted by her thoughts.
Ivan Dmitritch pictured to himself autumn with its rains, its cold evenings, and its St. Martin's summer. At that season he would have to take longer walks about the garden and beside the river, so as to get thoroughly chilled, and then drink a big glass of vodka and eat a salted mushroom or a soused cucumber, and then--drink another. . . . The children would come running from the kitchen-garden, bringing a carrot and a radish smelling of fresh earth. . . . And then, he would lie stretched full length on the sofa, and in leisurely fashion turn over the pages of some illustrated magazine, or, covering his face with it and unbuttoning his waistcoat, give himself up to slumber.
The St. Martin's summer is followed by cloudy, gloomy weather. It rains day and night, the bare trees weep, the wind is damp and cold. The dogs, the horses, the fowls--all are wet, depressed, downcast. There is nowhere to walk; one can't go out for days together; one has to pace up and down the room, looking despondently at the grey window. It is dreary!
Ivan Dmitritch stopped and looked at his wife.
""I should go abroad, you know, Masha,"" he said.
And he began thinking how nice it would be in late autumn to go abroad somewhere to the South of France ... to Italy ... to India!
""I should certainly go abroad too,"" his wife said. ""But look at the number of the ticket!""
""Wait, wait! ...""
He walked about the room and went on thinking. It occurred to him: what if his wife really did go abroad? It is pleasant to travel alone, or in the society of light, careless women who live in the present, and not such as think and talk all the journey about nothing but their children, sigh, and tremble with dismay over every farthing. Ivan Dmitritch imagined his wife in the train with a multitude of parcels, baskets, and bags; she would be sighing over something, complaining that the train made her head ache, that she had spent so much money.... At the stations he would continually be having to run for boiling water, bread and butter. ...She wouldn't have dinner because of its being too dear....
""She would begrudge me every farthing,"" he thought, with a glance at his wife. ""The lottery ticket is hers, not mine! Besides, what is the use of her going abroad? What does she want there? She would shut herself up in the hotel, and not let me out of her sight.... I know!""
And for the first time in his life his mind dwelt on the fact that his wife had grown elderly and plain, and that she was saturated through and through with the smell of cooking, while he was still young, fresh, and healthy, and might well have got married again.
""Of course, all that is silly nonsense,"" he thought; ""but...why should she go abroad? What would she make of it? And yet she would go, of course.... I can fancy.... In reality it is all one to her, whether it is Naples or Klin. She would only be in my way. I should be dependent upon her. I can fancy how, like a regular woman, she will lock the money up as soon as she gets it.... She will look after her relations and grudge me every farthing.""
Ivan Dmitritch thought of her relations. All those wretched brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles would come crawling about as soon as they heard of the winning ticket, would begin whining like beggars, and fawning upon them with oily, hypocritical smiles. Wretched, detestable people! If they were given anything, they would ask for more; while if they were refused, they would swear at them, slander them, and wish them every kind of misfortune.
Ivan Dmitritch remembered his own relations, and their faces, at which he had looked impartially in the past, struck him now as repulsive and hateful.
""They are such reptiles!"" he thought.
And his wife's face, too, struck him as repulsive and hateful. Anger surged up in his heart against her, and he thought malignantly:
""She knows nothing about money, and so she is stingy. If she won it she would give me a hundred roubles, and put the rest away under lock and key.""
And he looked at his wife, not with a smile now, but with hatred. She glanced at him too, and also with hatred and anger. She had her own daydreams, her own plans, her own reflections; she understood perfectly well what her husband's dreams were. She knew who would be the first to try to grab her winnings.
""It's very nice making daydreams at other people's expense!"" is what her eyes expressed. ""No, don't you dare!""
Her husband understood her look; hatred began stirring again in his breast, and in order to annoy his wife he glanced quickly, to spite her at the fourth page on the newspaper and read out triumphantly:
""Series 9,499, number 46! Not 26!""
Hatred and hope both disappeared at once, and it began immediately to seem to Ivan Dmitritch and his wife that their rooms were dark and small and low-pitched, that the supper they had been eating was not doing them good, but Lying heavy on their stomachs, that the evenings were long and wearisome. . . .
""What the devil's the meaning of it?"" said Ivan Dmitritch, beginning to be ill-humored. 'Wherever one steps there are bits of paper under one's feet, crumbs, husks. The rooms are never swept! One is simply forced to go out. Damnation take my soul entirely! I shall go and hang myself on the first aspen-tree!""","Ivan Dmitritch, a content middle-class man, is reading the newspaper when his wife asks him to check if their lottery ticket number is a winner. Ivan, who doesn't believe in lottery luck, reluctantly looks at the list and is shocked to find their series number, 9,499. Excited about the possibility of winning, Ivan and his wife imagine the life they would have with the prize money of seventy-five thousand. They dream of buying an estate, traveling, and enjoying a life of leisure. However, as Ivan starts thinking about the implications of winning, he begins to resent his wife. He imagines her controlling the money, taking care of her relatives, and begrudging him every penny. This leads to a growing hatred between them.

Luck,Mark Twain,"It was at a banquet in London in honor of one of the two or three conspicuously illustrious English military names of this generation. For reasons which will presently appear, I will withhold his real name and titles, and call him Lieutenant General Lord Arthur Scoresby, V.C., K.C.B., etc., etc., etc. What a fascination there is in a renowned name! There sat the man, in actual flesh, whom I had heard of so many thousands of times since that day, thirty years before, when his name shot suddenly to the zenith from a Crimean battlefield, to remain forever celebrated. It was food and drink to me to look, and look, and look at that demigod; scanning, searching, noting: the quietness, the reserve, the noble gravity of his countenance; the simple honesty that expressed itself all over him; the sweet unconsciousness of his greatness—unconsciousness of the hundreds of admiring eyes fastened upon him, unconsciousness of the deep, loving, sincere worship welling out of the breasts of those people and flowing toward him.
The clergyman at my left was an old acquaintance of mine—clergyman now, but had spent the first half of his life in the camp and field, and as an instructor in the military school at Woolwich. Just at the moment I have been talking about, a veiled and singular light glimmered in his eyes, and he leaned down and muttered confidentially to me—indicating the hero of the banquet with a gesture:
""Privately—he's an absolute fool.""
This verdict was a great surprise to me. If its subject had been Napoleon, or Socrates, or Solomon, my astonishment could not have been greater. Two things I was well aware of: that the Reverend was a man of strict veracity, and that his judgement of men was good. Therefore I knew, beyond doubt or question, that the world was mistaken about this hero: he was a fool. So I meant to find out, at a convenient moment, how the Reverend, all solitary and alone, had discovered the secret.
Some days later the opportunity came, and this is what the Reverend told me.
About forty years ago I was an instructor in the military academy at Woolwich. I was present in one of the sections when young Scoresby underwent his preliminary examination. I was touched to the quick with pity; for the rest of the class answered up brightly and handsomely, while he—why, dear me, he didn't know anything, so to speak. He was evidently good, and sweet, and lovable, and guileless; and so it was exceedingly painful to see him stand there, as serene as a graven image, and deliver himself of answers which were veritably miraculous for stupidity and ignorance. All the compassion in me was aroused in his behalf. I said to myself, when he comes to be examined again, he will be flung over, of course; so it will be simply a harmless act of charity to ease his fall as much as I can. I took him aside, and found that he knew a little of Cæsar's history; and as he didn't know anything else, I went to work and drilled him like a galley slave on a certain line of stock questions concerning Cæsar which I knew would be used. If you'll believe me, he went through with flying colors on examination day! He went through on that purely superficial ""cram,"" and got compliments too, while others, who knew a thousand times more than he, got plucked. By some strangely lucky accident—an accident not likely to happen twice in a century—he was asked no question outside of the narrow limits of his drill.
It was stupefying. Well, all through his course I stood by him, with something of the sentiment which a mother feels for a crippled child; and he always saved himself—just by miracle, apparently.
Now of course the thing that would expose him and kill him at last was mathematics. I resolved to make his death as easy as I could; so I drilled him and crammed him, and crammed him and drilled him, just on the line of questions which the examiners would be most likely to use, and then launching him on his fate. Well, sir, try to conceive of the result: to my consternation, he took the first prize! And with it he got a perfect ovation in the way of compliments.
Sleep? There was no more sleep for me for a week. My conscience tortured me day and night. What I had done I had done purely through charity, and only to ease the poor youth's fall—I never had dreamed of any such preposterous result as the thing that had happened. I felt as guilty and miserable as the creator of Frankenstein. Here was a woodenhead whom I had put in the way of glittering promotions and prodigious responsibilities, and but one thing could happen: he and his responsibilities would all go to ruin together at the first opportunity.
The Crimean war had just broken out. Of course there had to be a war, I said to myself: we couldn't have peace and give this donkey a chance to die before he is found out. I waited for the earthquake. It came. And it made me reel when it did come. He was actually gazetted to a captaincy in a marching regiment! Better men grow old and gray in the service before they climb to a sublimity like that. And who could ever have foreseen that they would go and put such a load of responsibility on such green and inadequate shoulders? I could just barely have stood it if they had made him a cornet; but a captain—think of it! I thought my hair would turn white.
Consider what I did—I who so loved repose and inaction. I said to myself, I am responsible to the country for this, and I must go along with him and protect the country against him as far as I can. So I took my poor little capital that I had saved up through years of work and grinding economy, and went with a sigh and bought a cornetcy in his regiment, and away we went to the field.
And there—oh dear, it was awful. Blunders? Why, he never did anything but blunder. But, you see, nobody was in the fellow's secret—everybody had him focused wrong, and necessarily misinterpreted his performance every time—consequently they took his idiotic blunders for inspirations of genius; they did, honestly! His mildest blunders were enough to make a man in his right mind cry; and they did make me cry—and rage and rave too, privately. And the thing that kept me always in a sweat of apprehension was the fact that every fresh blunder he made increased the luster of his reputation! I kept saying to myself, he'll get so high, that when discovery does finally come, it will be like the sun falling out of the sky.
He went right along up, from grade to grade, over the dead bodies of his superiors, until at last, in the hottest moment of the battle of ------- down went our colonel, and my heart jumped into my mouth, for Scoresby was next in rank! Now for it, said I; we'll all land in Sheol in ten minutes, sure.
The battle was awfully hot; the allies were steadily giving way all over the field. Our regiment occupied a position that was vital; a blunder now must be destruction. At this crucial moment, what does this immortal fool do but detach the regiment from its place and order a charge over a neighboring hill where there wasn't a suggestion of an enemy! ""There you go!"" I said to myself; ""this is the end at last.""
And away we did go, and were over the shoulder of the hill before the insane movement could be discovered and stopped. And what did we find? An entire and unsuspected Russian army in reserve! And what happened? We were eaten up? That is necessarily what would have happened in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. But no, those Russians argued that no single regiment would come browsing around there at such a time. It must be the entire English army, and that the sly Russian game was detected and blocked; so they turned tail, and away they went, pell-mell, over the hill and down into the field, in wild confusion, and we after them; they themselves broke the solid Russian center in the field, and tore through, and in no time there was the most tremendous rout you ever saw, and the defeat of the allies was turned into a sweeping and splendid victory! Marshal Canrobert looked on, dizzy with astonishment, admiration,and delight; and sent right off for Scoresby, and hugged him, and decorated him on the field, in presence of all the armies!
And what was Scoresby's blunder that time? Merely the mistaking his right hand for his left—that was all. An order had come to him to fall back and support our right; and instead, he fell forward and went over the hill to the left. But the name he won that day as a marvelous military genius filled the world with his glory, and that glory will never fade while history books last.
He is just as good and sweet and lovable and unpretending as a man can be, but he doesn't know enough to come in when it rains. Now that is absolutely true. He is the supremest ass in the universe; and until half an hour ago nobody knew it but himself and me. He has been pursued, day by day and year by year, by a most phenomenal and astonishing luckiness. He has been a shining soldier in all our wars for a generation; he has littered his whole military life with blunders, and yet has never committed one that didn't make him a knight or a baronet or a lord or something. Look at his breast; why, he is just clothed in domestic and foreign decorations. Well, sir, every one of them is the record of some shouting stupidity or other; and taken together, they are proof that the very best thing in all this world that can befall a man is to be born lucky. I say again, as I said at the banquet, Scoresby's an absolute fool.","The story begins at a banquet in London in honor of Lieutenant General Lord Arthur Scoresby, a renowned military figure. The narrator, sitting next to a clergyman who was previously an instructor at the military academy where Scoresby was a student, is surprised when the clergyman confidentially tells him that Scoresby is an absolute fool. Intrigued, the narrator seeks to understand how the clergyman came to this conclusion.

The clergyman explains that when Scoresby was a student, he appeared to be ignorant and unintelligent during his preliminary examination. Feeling pity for him, the clergyman decided to help Scoresby by drilling him on a specific set of questions about Julius Caesar that he knew would be asked in the next examination. To the clergyman's astonishment, Scoresby not only passed the examination but also received compliments for his performance. This pattern continued throughout Scoresby's education, with the clergyman helping him prepare for each exam.

When the Crimean War broke out, the clergyman, feeling responsible for Scoresby's success, bought a position as a cornet in his regiment to protect the country from the potential consequences of Scoresby's incompetence. However, to the clergyman's dismay, Scoresby continued to make blunders that were mistaken for acts of genius by others. Despite his lack of military knowledge and experience, Scoresby was promoted to captain just before a crucial battle.

During the battle, Scoresby made a disastrous decision to lead his regiment on a charge toward a hill where there was no enemy presence. To everyone's surprise, including the narrator's, they discovered an entire Russian army waiting for them on the other side of the hill. However, due to a lucky misunderstanding, the Russians retreated, and the allies achieved a resounding victory. Scoresby was hailed as a military genius, and his blunder was seen as a stroke of brilliance.

The clergyman explains that Scoresby's luck and ability to turn his blunders into triumphs have continued throughout his military career. He has received numerous honors and decorations for his supposed brilliance, but in reality, each one represents a mistake or act of stupidity. The clergyman concludes that despite being a good and kind-hearted person, Scoresby is an absolute fool.","The story is set at a banquet in London honoring Lieutenant General Lord Arthur Scoresby, a renowned military figure. The protagonist, a clergyman, confides to the narrator that Scoresby is actually an ""absolute fool."" Intrigued by this revelation, the narrator later approaches the clergyman for more details.

The clergyman explains that many years ago, he was an instructor at the military academy in Woolwich when Scoresby was a student. During his preliminary examination, Scoresby appeared ignorant and unintelligent compared to his classmates. Feeling sorry for him, the clergyman privately tutored Scoresby on a specific topic that he knew would be covered in the upcoming exam. To everyone's surprise, Scoresby excelled and received compliments.

Throughout his studies, Scoresby continued to struggle academically, but he managed to pass thanks to the clergyman's assistance. Worried about the consequences of Scoresby's lack of knowledge, the clergyman decided to ensure his success one last time by helping him prepare for the mathematics examination. However, Scoresby not only passed but received the highest score and praise.

Feeling guilty and anxious about the consequences, the clergyman decided to accompany Scoresby to the Crimean War, where they both served in the military. Despite Scoresby's continual blunders and mistakes, which the clergyman attributes to his lack of intelligence, he is consistently praised and promoted. The clergyman worries that when Scoresby's incompetence is eventually exposed, it will lead to disastrous consequences.

During a crucial battle, Scoresby orders a charge in the wrong direction, leading his regiment to unexpectedly encounter and defeat an entire Russian army. This victory is attributed to Scoresby's supposed strategic genius, further solidifying his reputation as a remarkable military leader.

The clergyman reveals that Scoresby's success is merely a result of blind luck and exceptional circumstances. Scoresby's blunders are mistakenly interpreted as innovative tactics, resulting in his continuous promotion and accumulation of honors. Despite his incompetence, Scoresby remains a kind, lovable, and unassuming man. However, the clergyman asserts that he is undeniably a fool.",s76
My Cheesecake-Shaped Poverty,Haruki Murakami,"The Triangle Zone was our name for the place. I couldn’t think of any better name for it. I mean, the area was a perfect triangle, as if someone had drawn it out. And she and I lived there, on that land. This was back in 1973 or ’74.

When I say “Triangle Zone,” don’t go picturing a kind of delta. The Triangle Zone we lived in was much narrower, more like a wedge. Imagine, say, a round, full-sized cheesecake. Cut it into twelve equal pieces with a knife so it’s like the face of a clock. What you’d end up with, of course, are twelve slices of thirty degrees each at the tip. Place one of these on a plate and, as you sip your tea, take a good hard look at it. That tapered end of the thin slice of cake? That’s exactly the shape of the Triangle Zone I’m talking about.

O.K., so how did such a weirdly shaped plot of land come about? Well you might ask. Or maybe not. Either way’s fine with me, since I don’t know the answer. I asked some of the neighbors about it, but all I found out was that it had been shaped like a triangle long, long ago, was a triangle now, and would probably—far, far into the future—remain a triangle. People there didn’t seem to want to talk about this Triangle Zone, or even think about it. For them, it was like talking about a wart behind your ear. Better left undiscussed. Probably because of its weird shape.

Railroad lines ran along either side of the Triangle Zone, one a national railway line, the other a private line. The two lines ran parallel for a while, then at the very tip of the wedge formed a junction where it was as if they were ripped apart, branching off at strange angles, one north and one south. It was quite a sight to see. Whenever I gazed at the trains whizzing by at the tip of the Triangle Zone, I felt as if I were standing on the bridge of a destroyer slicing its way through the ocean waves.

In terms of livability, the Triangle Zone was appalling. First of all, there was the obvious noise level. But what do you expect? How could it not be earsplitting to live hemmed in between two railroad lines? Open the front door and there was a train roaring by; open a window at the back of the house and yet another train would thunder by, right before your eyes. And when I say “right before your eyes,” I’m not exaggerating. The trains were so close that I could look the passengers in the eye and nod a greeting. Really something, now that I think about it.

You’d assume that it would be quiet after the last train of the night had passed by, right? I thought so, too, before I moved there. Problem was, there was no such thing as a last train. The last passenger train was just before 1 A.M., but then came the late-night freight trains. And, once they’d finished rolling by, at dawn, the next day’s passenger trains would start up again. It was an endless repeat of this, day after day.

Talk about crazy.

We picked this place to live in for one simple reason: it was dirt cheap. It was a detached house with three rooms, its own bath, and even a small garden, all for about the same price as renting a studio apartment. Since it was a stand-alone house, we could bring our cat along, too. It was as if the place had been specially made, just for us. We’d only recently got married, and, not to brag or anything, but we could very well have been featured in the Guinness Book of Records under “World’s Poorest Couple.” We saw the house listed in the window of a real-estate agent’s office near the station. At least as far as the rent and the layout of the rooms were concerned, this was a lucky find. Astonishing, even.

“Yeah, cheap it is. For sure,” the bald real-estate agent said. “But I have to warn you—it’s really noisy. As long as you can stand that, you could call it a lucky find.”

“Would you mind showing it to us?” I asked.

“Sure. But can’t the two of you just go? I get a headache every time I go to that place.”

He handed me the keys and drew a map. What an easygoing agent.

On the map, the Triangle Zone didn’t look far from the station, but, when we actually walked to it, it took forever. We had to detour around the railroad tracks, cross an overpass, and trudge up and down a somewhat filthy hill before we finally arrived at the rear of the Triangle Zone. There wasn’t a store in sight. A totally seedy neighborhood.

My wife and I went into the house at the very tip of the Triangle Zone and stayed for about an hour, just hanging out. During this time, trains kept on rumbling past. Whenever an express train roared by, the windows would rattle. We couldn’t hear each other while a train was passing. We’d be talking and then would have to stop until it was gone. We’d resume talking when it got quiet, only to be interrupted a moment later by yet another train. Choppy, interrupted communication à la Jean-Luc Godard.

Aside from the noise, the house wasn’t so bad. The structure itself was old-fashioned and in need of some serious repair, but on the plus side it had a tokonoma recessed alcove and a small outside sitting area attached to the house, and had a nice feel to it. Spring light shining in through the windows formed little sunny squares on the tatami. It was a lot like the house I’d lived in, years ago, when I was little. “Let’s take it,” I said. “I know it’s noisy, but we’ll get used to it.”

“If that’s what you think, I’m O.K. with it,” she said.

“Sitting here together like this, it feels like we’re married, our own family.”

“Well, we are married.”

“Well, yeah. True enough,” I said.

We went back to the real-estate agency and told the bald agent that we’d take it.

“Isn’t it too noisy?” he asked.

“Yes, it is, but we’ll get used to it,” I said.

The agent took off his glasses, wiped them with a tissue, took a sip of tea from his teacup, put his glasses back on, and looked at me.

“Well, ’cause you’re young,” he said.

“Right,” I replied.

And we filled out the rental agreement.

A friend’s little minivan was more than enough for our move. Futons, clothes, a lamp, a few books, and a cat—that was the extent of our belongings. Nothing else. No radio or TV. No washer or dining table or gas stove or telephone or kettle or vacuum cleaner. That was how poor we were. So our move, such as it was, took only half an hour. Life can be simpler if you don’t have much money.

When the friend who helped us move took one look at our new dwelling, hemmed in by railroad lines, he was aghast. After we’d unloaded everything, he turned to me and said something, but a passing express train drowned out his words.

“Did you say something?” I asked.

“People really live in a place like this, huh?” he commented, impressed.

We ended up living in that house for two years.

It was a poorly built house in a way, since wind blew in through cracks and gaps all over the place. Pleasant enough in the summer, but, come winter, it was hell. With no money to buy a space heater, my wife and I and the cat would crawl under the futons once the sun set, literally clinging to each other to keep warm. Many a time we’d wake up to find the water in the kitchen faucet frozen solid.

Once winter passed, the spring would come. And spring was a lovely season. She and I and the cat would breathe a sigh of relief. In April, the railroads went on strike for a few days, and we were ecstatic. Not a single train came rumbling by all day. We carried the cat down to the railroad tracks and sat there sunning ourselves. It was so quiet it was as if we were sitting at the bottom of a lake. We were young, just married, and the sunshine was free!

Even now, when I hear the word “poor,” I remember that thin, triangular sliver of land. And I wonder, Who could be living there now?","The narrator and his wife live in a small, triangular plot of land called the Triangle Zone. The area is hemmed in by two railroad lines, making it extremely noisy. However, they chose to live there because it was cheap and allowed them to bring their cat. The house itself is old and in need of repairs, but it has a nice feel to it. Despite the noise and the poor living conditions, they decide to stay and get used to it.

Over the course of two years, the couple endures the noise and the harsh winters. They have very few belongings and live a simple life. In the spring, they enjoy the relief from the noise and the warmth of the sun. The narrator reflects on their time in the Triangle Zone and wonders who could be living there now.

Moonlight,Guy de Maupassant,"Madame Julie Roubere was expecting her elder sister, Madame Henriette Letore, who had just returned from a trip to Switzerland.
The Letore household had left nearly five weeks before. Madame Henriette had allowed her husband to return alone to their estate in Calvados, where some business required his attention, and had come to spend a few days in Paris with her sister. Night came on. In the quiet parlor Madame Roubere was reading in the twilight in an absent-minded way, raising her eyes whenever she heard a sound.
At last, she heard a ring at the door, and her sister appeared, wrapped in a travelling cloak. And without any formal greeting, they clasped each other in an affectionate embrace, only desisting for a moment to give each other another hug. Then they talked about their health, about their respective families, and a thousand other things, gossiping, jerking out hurried, broken sentences as they followed each other about, while Madame Henriette was removing her hat and veil.
It was now quite dark. Madame Roubere rang for a lamp, and as soon as it was brought in, she scanned her sister's face, and was on the point of embracing her once more. But she held back, scared and astonished at the other's appearance.
On her temples Madame Letore had two large locks of white hair. All the rest of her hair was of a glossy, raven-black hue; but there alone, at each side of her head, ran, as it were, two silvery streams which were immediately lost in the black mass surrounding them. She was, nevertheless, only twenty-four years old, and this change had come on suddenly since her departure for Switzerland.
Without moving, Madame Roubere gazed at her in amazement, tears rising to her eyes, as she thought that some mysterious and terrible calamity must have befallen her sister. She asked:
""What is the matter with you, Henriette?""
Smiling with a sad face, the smile of one who is heartsick, the other replied:
""Why, nothing, I assure you. Were you noticing my white hair?""
But Madame Roubere impetuously seized her by the shoulders, and with a searching glance at her, repeated:
""What is the matter with you? Tell me what is the matter with you. And if you tell me a falsehood, I'll soon find it out.""
They remained face to face, and Madame Henriette, who looked as if she were about to faint, had two pearly tears in the corners of her drooping eyes.
Her sister continued:
""What has happened to you? What is the matter with you? Answer me!""
Then, in a subdued voice, the other murmured:
""I have--I have a lover.""
And, hiding her forehead on the shoulder of her younger sister, she sobbed.
Then, when she had grown a little calmer, when the heaving of her breast had subsided, she commenced to unbosom herself, as if to cast forth this secret from herself, to empty this sorrow of hers into a sympathetic heart.
Thereupon, holding each other's hands tightly clasped, the two women went over to a sofa in a dark corner of the room, into which they sank, and the younger sister, passing her arm over the elder one's neck, and drawing her close to her heart, listened.
""Oh! I know that there was no excuse for me; I do not understand myself, and since that day I feel as if I were mad. Be careful, my child, about yourself--be careful! If you only knew how weak we are, how quickly we yield, and fall. It takes so little, so little, so little, a moment of tenderness, one of those sudden fits of melancholy which come over you, one of those longings to open, your arms, to love, to cherish something, which we all have at certain moments.
""You know my husband, and you know how fond I am of him; but he is mature and sensible, and cannot even comprehend the tender vibrations of a woman's heart. He is always the same, always good, always smiling, always kind, always perfect. Oh! how I sometimes have wished that he would clasp me roughly in his arms, that he would embrace me with those slow, sweet kisses which make two beings intermingle, which are like mute confidences! How I have wished that he were foolish, even weak, so that he should have need of me, of my caresses, of my tears!
""This all seems very silly; but we women are made like that. How can we help it?
""And yet the thought of deceiving him never entered my mind. Now it has happened, without love, without reason, without anything, simply because the moon shone one night on the Lake of Lucerne.
""During the month when we were travelling together, my husband, with his calm indifference, paralyzed my enthusiasm, extinguished my poetic ardor. When we were descending the mountain paths at sunrise, when as the four horses galloped along with the diligence, we saw, in the transparent morning haze, valleys, woods, streams, and villages, I clasped my hands with delight, and said to him: 'How beautiful it is, dear! Give me a kiss! Kiss me now!' He only answered, with a smile of chilling kindliness: 'There is no reason why we should kiss each other because you like the landscape.'
""And his words froze me to the heart. It seems to me that when people love each other, they ought to feel more moved by love than ever, in the presence of beautiful scenes.
""In fact, I was brimming over with poetry which he kept me from expressing. I was almost like a boiler filled with steam and hermetically sealed.
""One evening (we had for four days been staying in a hotel at Fluelen) Robert, having one of his sick headaches, went to bed immediately after dinner, and I went to take a walk all alone along the edge of the lake.
""It was a night such as one reads of in fairy tales. The full moon showed itself in the middle of the sky; the tall mountains, with their snowy crests, seemed to wear silver crowns; the waters of the lake glittered with tiny shining ripples. The air was mild, with that kind of penetrating warmth which enervates us till we are ready to faint, to be deeply affected without any apparent cause. But how sensitive, how vibrating the heart is at such moments! how quickly it beats, and how intense is its emotion!
""I sat down on the grass, and gazed at that vast, melancholy, and fascinating lake, and a strange feeling arose in me; I was seized with an insatiable need of love, a revolt against the gloomy dullness of my life. What! would it never be my fate to wander, arm in arm, with a man I loved, along a moon-kissed bank like this? Was I never to feel on my lips those kisses so deep, delicious, and intoxicating which lovers exchange on nights that seem to have been made by God for tenderness? Was I never to know ardent, feverish love in the moonlit shadows of a summer's night?
""And I burst out weeping like a crazy woman. I heard something stirring behind me. A man stood there, gazing at me. When I turned my head round, he recognized me, and, advancing, said:
""'You are weeping, madame?'
""It was a young barrister who was travelling with his mother, and whom we had often met. His eyes had frequently followed me.
""I was so confused that I did not know what answer to give or what to think of the situation. I told him I felt ill.
""He walked on by my side in a natural and respectful manner, and began talking to me about what we had seen during our trip. All that I had felt he translated into words; everything that made me thrill he understood perfectly, better than I did myself. And all of a sudden he repeated some verses of Alfred de Musset. I felt myself choking, seized with indescribable emotion. It seemed to me that the mountains themselves, the lake, the moonlight, were singing to me about things ineffably sweet.
""And it happened, I don't know how, I don't know why, in a sort of hallucination.
""As for him, I did not see him again till the morning of his departure.
""He gave me his card!""
And, sinking into her sister's arms, Madame Letore broke into groans-- almost into shrieks.
Then, Madame Roubere, with a self-contained and serious air, said very gently:
""You see, sister, very often it is not a man that we love, but love itself. And your real lover that night was the moonlight.""","Madame Julie Roubere eagerly awaits the return of her sister, Madame Henriette Letore, who had been away on a trip to Switzerland.

The Mouse,H. H. Munro,"Theodoric Voler had been brought up, from infancy to the confines of middle age, by a fond mother whose chief solicitude had been to keep him screened from what she called the coarser realities of life. When she died she left Theodoric alone in a world that was as real as ever, and a good deal coarser than he considered it had any need to be. To a man of his temperament and upbringing even a simple railway journey was crammed with petty annoyances and minor discords, and as he settled himself down in a second-class compartment one September morning he was conscious of ruffled feelings and general mental discomposure. He had been staying at a country vicarage, the inmates of which had been certainly neither brutal nor bacchanalian, but their supervision of the domestic establishment had been of that lax order which invites disaster. The pony carriage that was to take him to the station had never been properly ordered, and when the moment for his departure drew near, the handyman who should have produced the required article was nowhere to be found. In this emergency Theodoric, to his mute but very intense disgust, found himself obliged to collaborate with the vicar's daughter in the task of harnessing the pony, which necessitated groping about in an ill-lighted outbuilding called a stable, and melling very like one--except in patches where it smelled of mice. Without being actually afraid of mice, Theodoric classed them among the coarser incidents of life, and considered that Providence, with a little exercise of moral courage, might long ago have recognized that they were not indispensable, and have withdrawn them from circulation. As the train glided out of the station Theodoric's nervous imagination accused himself of exhaling a weak odor of stable yard, and possibly of displaying a moldy straw or two on his unusually well-brushed garments. Fortunately the only other occupation of the compartment, a lady of about the same age as himself, seemed inclined for slumber rather than scrutiny; the train was not due to stop till the terminus was reached, in about an hour's time, and the carriage was of the oId-fashioned sort that held no communication with a corridor, therefore no further traveling companions were likely to intrude on Theodoric's semiprivacy. And yet the train had scarcely attained its normal speed before he became reluctantly but vividly aware that he was not alone with the slumbering lady; he was not even alone in his own clothes. A warm, creeping movement over his flesh betrayed the unwelcome and highly resented presence, unseen but poignant, of a strayed mouse, that had evidently dashed into its present retreat during the episode of the pony harnessing. Furtive stamps and shakes and wildly directed pinches failed to dislodge the intruder, whose motto, indeed, seemed to be Excelsior; and the lawful occupant of the clothes lay back against the cushions and endeavored rapidly to evolve some means for putting an end to the dual ownership. It was unthinkable that he should continue for the space of a whole hour in the horrible position of a Rowton House for vagrant mice already his imagination had at least doubled the numbers of the alien invasion. On the other hand, nothing less drastic than partial disrobing would ease him of his tormentor, and to undress in the presence of a lady, even for so laudable a purpose, was an idea that made his ear tips tingle in a blush of abject shame. He had never heen able to bring himself even to the mild exposure of openwork socks in the presence of the fair sex. And yet--the lady in this case was to all appearances soundly and securely asleep; the mouse, on the other hand, seemed to be trying to crowd a wanderjahr into a few strenuous minutes. If there is any truth in the theory of transmigration, this particular mouse must certainly have been in a former state a member of the Alpine Club. Sometimes in its eagerness it lost its footing and slipped for half an inch or so; and then, in fright, or more probably temper, it bit. Theodoric was goaded into the most audacious undertaking of his life. Crimsoning to the hue of a beetroot and keeping an agonized watch on his slumbering fellow traveler, he swiftly and noiselessly secured the ends of his railway rug to the racks on either side of the carriage, so that a substantial curtain hung athwart the compartment. In the narrow dressing room that he had thus improvised he proceeded with violent haste to extricate himself partially and the mouse entirely from the surrounding casings of tweed and half-wool. As the unraveled mouse gave a wild leap to the floor, the rug, slipping its fastening at either end, also came down with a heart-curdling flop, and almost simultaneously the awakened sleeper opened her eyes. With a movement almost quicker than the mouse's, Theodoric pounced on the rug and hauled its ample folds chin-high over his dismantled person as he collapsed into the farther corner of the carriage. The blood raced and beat in the veins of his neck and forehead, while he waited dumbly for the communication cord to be pulled. The lady, however, contented herself with a silent stare at her strangely muffled companion. How much had she seen, Theodoric queried to himself; and in any case what on earth must she think of his present posture?
""I think I have caught a chill,"" he ventured desperately.
""Really, I'm sorry,"" she replied. ""I was just going to ask you if you would open this window.""
""I fancy it's malaria,"" he added, his teeth chattering slightly, as much from fright as from a desire to support his theory.
""I've got some brandy in my holdall, if you'll kindly reach it down for me,"" said his companion.
""Not for worlds--I mean, I never take anything for it,"" he assured her earnestly.
""I suppose you caught it in the tropics?""
Theodoric, whose acquaintance with the tropics was limited to an annual present of a chest of tea from an uncle in Ceylon, felt that even the malaria was slipping from him. Would it be possible, he wondered to disclose the real state of affairs to her in small installments?
""Are you afraid of mice?"" he ventured, growing, if possible, more scarlet in the face.
""Not unless they came in quantities. Why do you ask?""
""I had one crawling inside my clothes just now,"" said Theodoric in a voice that hardly seemed his own. ""It was a most awkward situation.""
""It must have been, if you wear your clothes at all tight,"" she observed. ""But mice have strange ideas of comfort.""
""I had to get rid of it while you were asleep,"" he continued. Then, with a gulp, he added, ""It was getting rid of it that brought me to-to this.""
""Surely leaving off one small mouse wouldn't bring on a chill,"" she exclaimed, with a levity that Theodoric accounted abominable.
Evidently she had detected something of his predicament, and was enjoying his confusion. All the blood in his body seemed to have mobilized in one concentrated blush, and an agony of abasement, worse than a myriad mice, crept up and down over his soul. And then, as reflection began to assert itself, sheer terror took the place of humiliation. With every minute that passed the train was rushing nearer to the crowded and bustling terminus, where dozens of prying eyes would be exchanged for the one paralyzing pair that watched him from the farther corner of the carriage. There was one slender, despairing chance, which the next few minutes must decide. His fellow traveler might relapse into a blessed slumber. But as the minutes throbbed by that chance ebbed away. The furtive glance which Theodoric stole at her from time to time disclosed only an unwinking wakefulness.
""I think we must be getting near now,"" she presently observed.
Theodoric had already noted with growing terror the recurring stacks of small, ugly dwellings that heralded the journey's end. The words acted as a signal. Like a hunted beast breaking cover and dashing madly toward some other haven of momentary safety he threw aside his rug, and struggled frantically into his disheveled garments. He was conscious of dull suburban stations racing past the window, of a choking, hammering sensation in his throat and heart, and of an icy silence in that corner toward which he dared not look. Then as he sank back in his seat, clothed and almost delirious, the train slowed down to a final crawl, and the woman spoke.
""Would you be so kind,"" she asked, ""as to get me a porter to put me into a cab? It's a shame to trouble you when you're feeling unwell, but being blind makes one so helpless at a railway station.""","Theodoric Voler, a man who has been sheltered from the harsh realities of life, embarks on a train journey that quickly becomes a series of annoyances. He is forced to help harness a pony for his transportation to the station, which results in him having a mouse trapped in his clothes. Desperate to get rid of the mouse without undressing in front of a lady in the compartment, Theodoric creates a makeshift curtain using his rug and manages to free the mouse. However, the lady wakes up and Theodoric awkwardly tries to explain his situation, only to be met with amusement from her. As the train approaches the crowded terminus, Theodoric desperately hopes the lady will fall back asleep, but she remains awake. Eventually, she reveals that she is blind and asks for Theodoric's help in finding a porter to assist her.","Theodoric Voler, a man who had been sheltered from the realities of life, finds himself on a train journey with a mouse that has crawled into his clothes.

When she awakens, Theodoric pretends to have caught a chill and malaria to explain his strange behavior. As they converse, Theodoric finally reveals the truth about the mouse. The lady, not understanding the severity of the situation, teases him. Theodoric becomes increasingly humiliated and terrified as the train approaches the crowded terminus. He dresses quickly as they near the end of the journey, and when the lady requests assistance from a porter due to her blindness, Theodoric is relieved by an opportunity to escape the situation.",s79
Mrs. Packletide's Tiger,H. H. Munro,"It was Mrs. Packletide's pleasure and intention that she should shoot a tiger. Not that the lust to kill had suddenly descended on her, or that she felt that she would leave India safer and more wholesome than she had found it, with one fraction less of wild beast per million of inhabitants. The compelling motive for her sudden deviation towards the footsteps of Nimrod was the fact that Loona Bimberton had recently been carried eleven miles in an aeroplane by an Algerian aviator, and talked of nothing else; only a personally procured tiger-skin and a heavy harvest of Press photographs could successfully counter that sort of thing. Mrs. Packletide had already arranged in her mind the lunch she would give at her house in Curzon Street, ostensibly in Loona Bimberton's honour, with a tiger-skin rug occupying most of the foreground and all of the conversation. She had also already designed in her mind the tiger-claw broach that she was going to give Loona Bimberton on her next birthday. In a world that is supposed to be chiefly swayed by hunger and by love Mrs. Packletide was an exception; her movements and motives were largely governed by dislike of Loona Bimberton.
Circumstances proved propitious. Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without over-much risk or exertion, and it so happened that a neighbouring village could boast of being the favoured rendezvous of an animal of respectable antecedents, which had been driven by the increasing infirmities of age to abandon game-killing and confine its appetite to the smaller domestic animals. The prospect of earning the thousand rupees had stimulated the sporting and commercial instinct of the villagers; children were posted night and day on the outskirts of the local jungle to head the tiger back in the unlikely event of his attempting to roam away to fresh hunting-grounds, and the cheaper kinds of goats were left about with elaborate carelessness to keep him satisfied with his present quarters. The one great anxiety was lest he should die of old age before the date appointed for the memsahib's shoot. Mothers carrying their babies home through the jungle after the day's work in the fields hushed their singing lest they might curtail the restful sleep of the venerable herd-robber.
The great night duly arrived, moonlit and cloudless. A platform had been constructed in a comfortable and conveniently placed tree, and thereon crouched Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin. A goat, gifted with a particularly persistent bleat, such as even a partially deaf tiger might be reasonably expected to hear on a still night, was tethered at the correct distance. With an accurately sighted rifle and a thumb-nail pack of patience cards the sportswoman awaited the coming of the quarry.
""I suppose we are in some danger?"" said Miss Mebbin.
She was not actually nervous about the wild beast, but she had a morbid dread of performing an atom more service than she had been paid for.
""Nonsense,"" said Mrs. Packletide; ""it's a very old tiger. It couldn't spring up here even if it wanted to.""
""If it's an old tiger I think you ought to get it cheaper. A thousand rupees is a lot of money.""
Louisa Mebbin adopted a protective elder-sister attitude towards money in general, irrespective of nationality or denomination. Her energetic intervention had saved many a rouble from dissipating itself in tips in some Moscow hotel, and francs and centimes clung to her instinctively under circumstances which would have driven them headlong from less sympathetic hands. Her speculations as to the market depreciation of tiger remnants were cut short by the appearance on the scene of the animal itself. As soon as it caught sight of the tethered goat it lay flat on the earth, seemingly less from a desire to take advantage of all available cover than for the purpose of snatching a short rest before commencing the grand attack.
""I believe it's ill,"" said Louisa Mebbin, loudly in Hindustani, for the benefit of the village headman, who was in ambush in a neighbouring tree.
""Hush!"" said Mrs. Packletide, and at that moment the tiger commenced ambling towards his victim.
""Now, now!"" urged Miss Mebbin with some excitement; ""if he doesn't touch the goat we needn't pay for it."" (The bait was an extra.)
The rifle flashed out with a loud report, and the great tawny beast sprang to one side and then rolled over in the stillness of death. In a moment a crowd of excited natives had swarmed on to the scene, and their shouting speedily carried the glad news to the village, where a thumping of tom-toms took up the chorus of triumph. And their triumph and rejoicing found a ready echo in the heart of Mrs. Packletide; already that luncheon-party in Curzon Street seemed immeasurably nearer.
It was Louisa Mebbin who drew attention to the fact that the goat was in death-throes from a mortal bullet-wound, while no trace of the rifle's deadly work could be found on the tiger. Evidently the wrong animal had been hit, and the beast of prey had succumbed to heart-failure, caused by the sudden report of the rifle, accelerated by senile decay. Mrs. Packletide was pardonably annoyed at the discovery; but, at any rate, she was the possessor of a dead tiger, and the villagers, anxious for their thousand rupees, gladly connived at the fiction that she had shot the beast. And Miss Mebbin was a paid companion. Therefore did Mrs. Packletide face the cameras with a light heart, and her pictured fame reached from the pages of the Texas Weekly Snapshot to the illustrated Monday supplement of the Novoe Vremya. As for Loona Bimberton, she refused to look at an illustrated paper for weeks, and her letter of thanks for the gift of a tiger-claw brooch was a model of repressed emotions. The luncheon-party she declined; there are limits beyond which repressed emotions become dangerous.
From Curzon Street the tiger-skin rug travelled down to the Manor House, and was duly inspected and admired by the county, and it seemed a fitting and appropriate thing when Mrs. Packletide went to the County Costume Ball in the character of Diana. She refused to fall in, however, with Clovis's tempting suggestion of a primeval dance party, at which every one should wear the skins of beasts they had recently slain. ""I should be in rather a Baby Bunting condition,"" confessed Clovis, ""with a miserable rabbit-skin or two to wrap up in, but then,"" he added, with a rather malicious glance at Diana's proportions, ""my figure is quite as good as that Russian dancing boy's.""
""How amused every one would be if they knew what really happened,"" said Louisa Mebbin a few days after the ball.
""What do you mean?"" asked Mrs. Packletide quickly.
""How you shot the goat and frightened the tiger to death,"" said Miss Mebbin, with her disagreeably pleasant laugh.
""No one would believe it,"" said Mrs. Packletide, her face changing colour as rapidly as though it were going through a book of patterns before post-time.
""Loona Bimberton would,"" said Miss Mebbin. Mrs. Packletide's face settled on an unbecoming shade of greenish white.
""You surely wouldn't give me away?"" she asked.
""I've seen a week-end cottage near Darking that I should rather like to buy,"" said Miss Mebbin with seeming irrelevance. ""Six hundred and eighty, freehold. Quite a bargain, only I don't happen to have the money.""
*
Louisa Mebbin's pretty week-end cottage, christened by her ""Les Fauves,"" and gay in summer-time with its garden borders of tiger-lilies, is the wonder and admiration of her friends.
""It is a marvel how Louisa manages to do it,"" is the general verdict.
Mrs. Packletide indulges in no more big-game shooting.
""The incidental expenses are so heavy,"" she confides to inquiring friends.","Mrs. Packletide, motivated by jealousy of Loona Bimberton's recent fame, decides to shoot a tiger and have a lunch party with a tiger-skin rug as the centerpiece. She offers a thousand rupees for the opportunity to shoot a tiger, and a nearby village arranges for an old tiger to be driven towards her. Mrs. Packletide and her companion, Miss Mebbin, wait in a tree for the tiger to approach a tethered goat. Mrs. Packletide shoots, but it turns out that she hit the goat and frightened the tiger to death. The villagers pretend that she shot the tiger, and Mrs. Packletide becomes famous for her ""achievement."" However, Miss Mebbin threatens to expose the truth unless Mrs. Packletide buys her a cottage. Mrs. Packletide complies, and Miss Mebbin lives in her cottage, ""Les Fauves,"" which is decorated with tiger-lilies. Mrs. Packletide gives up big-game hunting due to the expenses involved.","Mrs. Packletide is determined to shoot a tiger to outdo Loona Bimberton, who has recently had an exciting experience in an aeroplane. Mrs. Packletide plans to display a tiger-skin rug at a lunch party in her honor. She finds a village with an old tiger and offers a reward for shooting it. The villagers ensure that the tiger stays in the area by leaving goats for him to eat. On the night of the hunt, Mrs. Packletide and her companion, Miss Mebbin, wait in a tree for the tiger to approach the tethered goat. Mrs. Packletide shoots, but it turns out that the tiger dies from the shock of the gunshot, not from being hit. The villagers pretend that Mrs. Packletide shot the tiger to collect their reward. Mrs. Packletide is happy with her newfound fame and the tiger-skin rug, while Loona Bimberton is upset by the news. Mrs. Packletide attends a costume ball as Diana and later discovers that Miss Mebbin knows the truth about the hunt. Mrs. Packletide fears that Miss Mebbin will expose her, but Miss Mebbin only reveals her knowledge when she wants to buy a cottage and needs money. Mrs. Packletide agrees to keep quiet and Miss Mebbin uses the money she receives to buy the cottage, which she names ""Les Fauves."" Mrs. Packletide no longer goes big-game hunting.",s80
One of These Days,Gabriel Garcia Marquez,"Monday dawned warm and rainless. Aurelio Escovar, a dentist without a degree, and a very early riser, opened his office at six. He took some false teeth, still mounted in their plaster mold, out of the glass case and put on the table a fistful of instruments which he arranged in size order, as if they were on display. He wore a collarless striped shirt, closed at the neck with a golden stud, and pants held up by suspenders He was erect and skinny, with a look that rarely corresponded to the situation, the way deaf people have of looking.
When he had things arranged on the table, he pulled the drill toward the dental chair and sat down to polish the false teeth. He seemed not to be thinking about what he was doing, but worked steadily, pumping the drill with his feet, even when he didn't need it.
After eight he stopped for a while to look at the sky through the window, and he saw two pensive buzzards who were drying themselves in the sun on the ridgepole of the house next door. He went on working with the idea that before lunch it would rain again. The shrill voice of his elevenyear-old son interrupted his concentration.
""Papa.""
""What?""
""The Mayor wants to know if you'll pull his tooth.""
""Tell him I'm not here.""
He was polishing a gold tooth. He held it at arm's length, and examined it with his eyes half closed. His son shouted again from the little waiting room.
""He says you are, too, because he can hear you.""
The dentist kept examining the tooth. Only when he had put it on the table with the finished work did he say:
""So much the better.""
He operated the drill again. He took several pieces of a bridge out of a cardboard box where he kept the things he still had to do and began to polish the gold.
""Papa.""
""What?""
He still hadn't changed his expression.
""He says if you don't take out his tooth, he'll shoot you.""
Without hurrying, with an extremely tranquil movement, he stopped pedaling the drill, pushed it away from the chair, and pulled the lower drawer of the table all the way out. There was a revolver. ""O.K.,"" he said. ""Tell him to come and shoot me.""
He rolled the chair over opposite the door, his hand resting on the edge of the drawer. The Mayor appeared at the door. He had shaved the left side of his face, but the other side, swollen and in pain, had a five-day-old beard. The dentist saw many nights of desperation in his dull eyes. He closed the drawer with his fingertips and said softly:
""Sit down.""
""Good morning,"" said the Mayor.
""Morning,"" said the dentist.
While the instruments were boiling, the Mayor leaned his skull on the headrest of the chair and felt better. His breath was icy. It was a poor office: an old wooden chair, the pedal drill, a glass case with ceramic bottles. Opposite the chair was a window with a shoulder-high cloth curtain. When he felt the dentist approach, the Mayor braced his heels and opened his mouth.
Aurelio Escovar turned his head toward the light. After inspecting the infected tooth, he closed the Mayor's jaw with a cautious pressure of his fingers.
""It has to be without anesthesia,"" he said.
""Why?""
""Because you have an abscess.""
The Mayor looked him in the eye. ""All right,"" he said, and tried to smile. The dentist did not return the smile. He brought the basin of sterilized instruments to the worktable and took them out of the water with a pair of cold tweezers, still without hurrying. Then he pushed the spittoon with the tip of his shoe, and went to wash his hands in the washbasin. He did all this without looking at the Mayor. But the Mayor didn't take his eyes off him.
It was a lower wisdom tooth. The dentist spread his feet and grasped the tooth with the hot forceps. The Mayor seized the arms of the chair, braced his feet with all his strength, and felt an icy void in his kidneys, but didn't make a sound. The dentist moved only his wrist. Without rancor, rather with a bitter tenderness, he said:
""Now you'll pay for our twenty dead men.""
The Mayor felt the crunch of bones in his jaw, and his eyes filled with tears. But he didn't breathe until he felt the tooth come out. Then he saw it through his tears. It seemed so foreign to his pain that he failed to understand his torture of the five previous nights.
Bent over the spittoon, sweating, panting, he unbuttoned his tunic and reached for the handkerchief in his pants pocket. The dentist gave him a clean cloth.
""Dry your tears,"" he said.
The Mayor did. He was trembling. While the dentist washed his hands, he saw the crumbling ceiling and a dusty spider web with spider's eggs and dead insects. The dentist returned, drying his hands. ""Go to bed,"" he said, ""and gargle with salt water."" The Mayor stood up, said goodbye with a casual military salute, and walked toward the door, stretching his legs, without buttoning up his tunic.
""Send the bill,"" he said.
""To you or the town?""
The Mayor didn't look at him. He closed the door and said through the screen:
""It's the same damn thing.""","Aurelio Escovar, a dentist without a degree, opens his office early in the morning. He polishes false teeth and arranges his instruments on the table. He is interrupted by his son, who tells him that the Mayor wants him to pull his tooth. Aurelio tells his son to say that he is not there, but the Mayor insists that he can hear Aurelio. Unfazed, Aurelio continues his work. When his son tells him that the Mayor threatens to shoot him if he doesn't pull his tooth, Aurelio calmly retrieves a revolver from his drawer and tells his son to tell the Mayor to come and shoot him.

The Mayor, with a swollen face and in pain, arrives at the office. Aurelio examines the Mayor's infected tooth and informs him that it has to be extracted without anesthesia due to an abscess. The Mayor agrees, and despite the pain, he braces himself and doesn't make a sound as Aurelio extracts the tooth. During the procedure, Aurelio tells the Mayor that he will pay for the deaths of twenty men.

After the tooth is extracted, the Mayor cries and the dentist offers him a clean cloth to dry his tears. The Mayor, trembling, unbuttons his tunic and takes a moment to compose himself. Aurelio advises the Mayor to gargle with salt water and go to bed. The Mayor leaves without buttoning up his tunic and tells Aurelio to send the bill, to which Aurelio asks if it should be sent to the Mayor or the town. The Mayor responds that it's the same thing and leaves.","Aurelio Escovar, a dentist with no formal education, opened his office early in the morning.

The Mayor consented, and despite the excruciating pain, he remained silent throughout the procedure. During the extraction, Aurelio made a cryptic remark about the Mayor paying for the deaths of twenty men. The Mayor didn't understand the meaning until he saw the extracted tooth, which seemed foreign to his pain. The Mayor dried his tears, thanked Aurelio, and left.

A RETRIEVED REFORMATION,O. Henry,"A guard came to the prison shoe-shop, where Jimmy Valentine was assiduously stitching uppers, and escorted him to the front office. There the warden handed Jimmy his pardon, which had been signed that morning by the governor. Jimmy took it in a tired kind of way. He had served nearly ten months of a four year sentence. He had expected to stay only about three months, at the longest. When a man with as many friends on the outside as Jimmy Valentine had is received in the ""stir"" it is hardly worth while to cut his hair.

""Now, Valentine,"" said the warden, ""you'll go out in the morning. Brace up, and make a man of yourself. You're not a bad fellow at heart. Stop cracking safes, and live straight.""

""Me?"" said Jimmy, in surprise. ""Why, I never cracked a safe in my life.""

""Oh, no,"" laughed the warden. ""Of course not. Let's see, now. How was it you happened to get sent up on that Springfield job? Was it because you wouldn't prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high-toned society? Or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you? It's always one or the other with you innocent victims.""

""Me?"" said Jimmy, still blankly virtuous. ""Why, warden, I never was in Springfield in my life!""

""Take him back, Cronin!"" said the warden, ""and fix him up with outgoing clothes. Unlock him at seven in the morning, and let him come to the bull-pen. Better think over my advice, Valentine.""

At a quarter past seven on the next morning Jimmy stood in the warden's outer office. He had on a suit of the villainously fitting, ready-made clothes and a pair of the stiff, squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests.

The clerk handed him a railroad ticket and the five-dollar bill with which the law expected him to rehabilitate himself into good citizenship and prosperity. The warden gave him a cigar, and shook hands. Valentine, 9762, was chronicled on the books, ""Pardoned by Governor,"" and Mr. James Valentine walked out into the sunshine.

Disregarding the song of the birds, the waving green trees, and the smell of the flowers, Jimmy headed straight for a restaurant. There he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine—followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him. From there he proceeded leisurely to the depot. He tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door, and boarded his train. Three hours set him down in a little town near the state line. He went to the café of one Mike Dolan and shook hands with Mike, who was alone behind the bar.

""Sorry we couldn't make it sooner, Jimmy, me boy,"" said Mike. ""But we had that protest from Springfield to buck against, and the governor nearly balked. Feeling all right?""

""Fine,"" said Jimmy. ""Got my key?""

He got his key and went upstairs, unlocking the door of a room at the rear. Everything was just as he had left it. There on the floor was still Ben Price's collar-button that had been torn from that eminent detective's shirt-band when they had overpowered Jimmy to arrest him.

Pulling out from the wall a folding-bed, Jimmy slid back a panel in the wall and dragged out a dust-covered suit-case. He opened this and gazed fondly at the finest set of burglar's tools in the East. It was a complete set, made of specially tempered steel, the latest designs in drills, punches, braces and bits, jimmies, clamps, and augers, with two or three novelties, invented by Jimmy himself, in which he took pride. Over nine hundred dollars they had cost him to have made at ----, a place where they make such things for the profession.

In half an hour Jimmy went down stairs and through the café. He was now dressed in tasteful and well-fitting clothes, and carried his dusted and cleaned suit-case in his hand.

""Got anything on?"" asked Mike Dolan, genially.

""Me?"" said Jimmy, in a puzzled tone. ""I don't understand. I'm representing the New York Amalgamated Short Snap Biscuit Cracker and Frazzled Wheat Company.""

This statement delighted Mike to such an extent that Jimmy had to take a seltzer-and-milk on the spot. He never touched ""hard"" drinks.

A week after the release of Valentine, 9762, there was a neat job of safe-burglary done in Richmond, Indiana, with no clue to the author. A scant eight hundred dollars was all that was secured. Two weeks after that a patented, improved, burglar-proof safe in Logansport was opened like a cheese to the tune of fifteen hundred dollars, currency; securities and silver untouched. That began to interest the rogue-catchers. Then an old-fashioned bank-safe in Jefferson City became active and threw out of its crater an eruption of bank-notes amounting to five thousand dollars. The losses were now high enough to bring the matter up into Ben Price's class of work. By comparing notes, a remarkable similarity in the methods of the burglaries was noticed. Ben Price investigated the scenes of the robberies, and was heard to remark:

""That's Dandy Jim Valentine's autograph. He's resumed business. Look at that combination knob—jerked out as easy as pulling up a radish in wet weather. He's got the only clamps that can do it. And look how clean those tumblers were punched out! Jimmy never has to drill but one hole. Yes, I guess I want Mr. Valentine. He'll do his bit next time without any short-time or clemency foolishness.""

Ben Price knew Jimmy's habits. He had learned them while working up the Springfield case. Long jumps, quick get-aways, no confederates, and a taste for good society—these ways had helped Mr. Valentine to become noted as a successful dodger of retribution. It was given out that Ben Price had taken up the trail of the elusive cracksman, and other people with burglar-proof safes felt more at ease.

One afternoon Jimmy Valentine and his suit-case climbed out of the mail-hack in Elmore, a little town five miles off the railroad down in the black-jack country of Arkansas. Jimmy, looking like an athletic young senior just home from college, went down the board side-walk toward the hotel.

A young lady crossed the street, passed him at the corner and entered a door over which was the sign, ""The Elmore Bank."" Jimmy Valentine looked into her eyes, forgot what he was, and became another man. She lowered her eyes and coloured slightly. Young men of Jimmy's style and looks were scarce in Elmore.

Jimmy collared a boy that was loafing on the steps of the bank as if he were one of the stockholders, and began to ask him questions about the town, feeding him dimes at intervals. By and by the young lady came out, looking royally unconscious of the young man with the suit-case, and went her way.

""Isn't that young lady Polly Simpson?"" asked Jimmy, with specious guile.

""Naw,"" said the boy. ""She's Annabel Adams. Her pa owns this bank. What'd you come to Elmore for? Is that a gold watch-chain? I'm going to get a bulldog. Got any more dimes?""

Jimmy went to the Planters' Hotel, registered as Ralph D. Spencer, and engaged a room. He leaned on the desk and declared his platform to the clerk. He said he had come to Elmore to look for a location to go into business. How was the shoe business, now, in the town? He had thought of the shoe business. Was there an opening?

The clerk was impressed by the clothes and manner of Jimmy. He, himself, was something of a pattern of fashion to the thinly gilded youth of Elmore, but he now perceived his shortcomings. While trying to figure out Jimmy's manner of tying his four-in-hand he cordially gave information.

Yes, there ought to be a good opening in the shoe line. There wasn't an exclusive shoe-store in the place. The dry-goods and general stores handled them. Business in all lines was fairly good. Hoped Mr. Spencer would decide to locate in Elmore. He would find it a pleasant town to live in, and the people very sociable.

Mr. Spencer thought he would stop over in the town a few days and look over the situation. No, the clerk needn't call the boy. He would carry up his suit-case, himself; it was rather heavy.

Mr. Ralph Spencer, the phœnix that arose from Jimmy Valentine's ashes—ashes left by the flame of a sudden and alterative attack of love—remained in Elmore, and prospered. He opened a shoe-store and secured a good run of trade.

Socially he was also a success, and made many friends. And he accomplished the wish of his heart. He met Miss Annabel Adams, and became more and more captivated by her charms.

At the end of a year the situation of Mr. Ralph Spencer was this: he had won the respect of the community, his shoe-store was flourishing, and he and Annabel were engaged to be married in two weeks. Mr. Adams, the typical, plodding, country banker, approved of Spencer. Annabel's pride in him almost equalled her affection. He was as much at home in the family of Mr. Adams and that of Annabel's married sister as if he were already a member.

One day Jimmy sat down in his room and wrote this letter, which he mailed to the safe address of one of his old friends in St. Louis:
 

        Dear Old Pal:

        I want you to be at Sullivan's place, in Little Rock, next Wednesday night, at nine o'clock. I want you to wind up some little matters for me. And, also, I want to make you a present of my kit of tools. I know you'll be glad to get them—you couldn't duplicate the lot for a thousand dollars. Say, Billy, I've quit the old business—a year ago. I've got a nice store. I'm making an honest living, and I'm going to marry the finest girl on earth two weeks from now. It's the only life, Billy—the straight one. I wouldn't touch a dollar of another man's money now for a million. After I get married I'm going to sell out and go West, where there won't be so much danger of having old scores brought up against me. I tell you, Billy, she's an angel. She believes in me; and I wouldn't do another crooked thing for the whole world. Be sure to be at Sully's, for I must see you. I'll bring along the tools with me.

        Your old friend,

        Jimmy.
         

On the Monday night after Jimmy wrote this letter, Ben Price jogged unobtrusively into Elmore in a livery buggy. He lounged about town in his quiet way until he found out what he wanted to know. From the drug-store across the street from Spencer's shoe-store he got a good look at Ralph D. Spencer.

""Going to marry the banker's daughter are you, Jimmy?"" said Ben to himself, softly. ""Well, I don't know!""

The next morning Jimmy took breakfast at the Adamses. He was going to Little Rock that day to order his wedding-suit and buy something nice for Annabel. That would be the first time he had left town since he came to Elmore. It had been more than a year now since those last professional ""jobs,"" and he thought he could safely venture out.

After breakfast quite a family party went downtown together—Mr. Adams, Annabel, Jimmy, and Annabel's married sister with her two little girls, aged five and nine. They came by the hotel where Jimmy still boarded, and he ran up to his room and brought along his suit-case. Then they went on to the bank. There stood Jimmy's horse and buggy and Dolph Gibson, who was going to drive him over to the railroad station.

All went inside the high, carved oak railings into the banking-room—Jimmy included, for Mr. Adams's future son-in-law was welcome anywhere. The clerks were pleased to be greeted by the good-looking, agreeable young man who was going to marry Miss Annabel. Jimmy set his suit-case down. Annabel, whose heart was bubbling with happiness and lively youth, put on Jimmy's hat, and picked up the suit-case. ""Wouldn't I make a nice drummer?"" said Annabel. ""My! Ralph, how heavy it is? Feels like it was full of gold bricks.""

""Lot of nickel-plated shoe-horns in there,"" said Jimmy, coolly, ""that I'm going to return. Thought I'd save express charges by taking them up. I'm getting awfully economical.""

The Elmore Bank had just put in a new safe and vault. Mr. Adams was very proud of it, and insisted on an inspection by every one. The vault was a small one, but it had a new, patented door. It fastened with three solid steel bolts thrown simultaneously with a single handle, and had a time-lock. Mr. Adams beamingly explained its workings to Mr. Spencer, who showed a courteous but not too intelligent interest. The two children, May and Agatha, were delighted by the shining metal and funny clock and knobs.

While they were thus engaged Ben Price sauntered in and leaned on his elbow, looking casually inside between the railings. He told the teller that he didn't want anything; he was just waiting for a man he knew.

Suddenly there was a scream or two from the women, and a commotion. Unperceived by the elders, May, the nine-year-old girl, in a spirit of play, had shut Agatha in the vault. She had then shot the bolts and turned the knob of the combination as she had seen Mr. Adams do.

The old banker sprang to the handle and tugged at it for a moment. ""The door can't be opened,"" he groaned. ""The clock hasn't been wound nor the combination set.""

Agatha's mother screamed again, hysterically.

""Hush!"" said Mr. Adams, raising his trembling hand. ""All be quite for a moment. Agatha!"" he called as loudly as he could. ""Listen to me."" During the following silence they could just hear the faint sound of the child wildly shrieking in the dark vault in a panic of terror.

""My precious darling!"" wailed the mother. ""She will die of fright! Open the door! Oh, break it open! Can't you men do something?""

""There isn't a man nearer than Little Rock who can open that door,"" said Mr. Adams, in a shaky voice. ""My God! Spencer, what shall we do? That child—she can't stand it long in there. There isn't enough air, and, besides, she'll go into convulsions from fright.""

Agatha's mother, frantic now, beat the door of the vault with her hands. Somebody wildly suggested dynamite. Annabel turned to Jimmy, her large eyes full of anguish, but not yet despairing. To a woman nothing seems quite impossible to the powers of the man she worships.

""Can't you do something, Ralph — try, won't you?""

He looked at her with a queer, soft smile on his lips and in his keen eyes.

""Annabel,"" he said, ""give me that rose you are wearing, will you?""

Hardly believing that she heard him aright, she unpinned the bud from the bosom of her dress, and placed it in his hand. Jimmy stuffed it into his vest-pocket, threw off his coat and pulled up his shirt-sleeves. With that act Ralph D. Spencer passed away and Jimmy Valentine took his place.

""Get away from the door, all of you,"" he commanded, shortly.

He set his suit-case on the table, and opened it out flat. From that time on he seemed to be unconscious of the presence of any one else. He laid out the shining, queer implements swiftly and orderly, whistling softly to himself as he always did when at work. In a deep silence and immovable, the others watched him as if under a spell.

In a minute Jimmy's pet drill was biting smoothly into the steel door. In ten minutes—breaking his own burglarious record—he threw back the bolts and opened the door.

Agatha, almost collapsed, but safe, was gathered into her mother's arms.

Jimmy Valentine put on his coat, and walked outside the railings towards the front door. As he went he thought he heard a far-away voice that he once knew call ""Ralph!"" But he never hesitated.

At the door a big man stood somewhat in his way.

""Hello, Ben!"" said Jimmy, still with his strange smile. ""Got around at last, have you? Well, let's go. I don't know that it makes much difference, now.""

And then Ben Price acted rather strangely.

""Guess you're mistaken, Mr. Spencer,"" he said. ""Don't believe I recognize you. Your buggy's waiting for you, ain't it?""

And Ben Price turned and strolled down the street.","Jimmy Valentine, a skilled safecracker, is released from prison after serving nearly ten months of a four-year sentence. The warden advises him to stop cracking safes and live a straight life, but Jimmy claims he has never cracked a safe in his life. He is given a train ticket and some money and is sent on his way.

Jimmy goes to a small town near the state line and meets up with his old friend, Mike Dolan. He retrieves his burglar's tools and decides to go straight. He changes his name to Ralph D. Spencer and opens a shoe store in Elmore.

Ralph becomes successful in both his business and social life. He falls in love with Annabel Adams, the daughter of a banker. They become engaged, and Ralph writes a letter to his old friend, Billy, telling him about his new life and how he has quit his old criminal ways.

Meanwhile, a series of safe burglaries occur in nearby towns, and the method used resembles Jimmy Valentine's signature techniques. Ben Price, a detective who has been after Jimmy for years, becomes suspicious and starts investigating the burglaries.

One day, Ralph and Annabel, along with Annabel's family, visit the bank where her father works. While they are inside, May, Annabel's sister, accidentally locks Agatha, her other sister, in the bank's vault. Panic ensues as they realize that the door cannot be opened without the combination, which was not set.

Ralph reveals his true identity as Jimmy Valentine and offers to open the vault. He successfully breaks into the vault using his burglar's tools and saves Agatha. Ben Price witnesses the entire incident and confronts Jimmy, but surprisingly, he lets Jimmy walk away without arresting him.

Jimmy leaves Elmore, believing that Ben Price recognized him but chose not to arrest him out of gratitude for saving Agatha. He walks away, never looking back.","Jimmy Valentine, a skilled safecracker, is released from prison on a pardon and advised by the warden to live a straight life. Jimmy, who claims to be innocent, is given new clothes, a train ticket, and a small amount of money. He heads to a small town where he plans to go back to his criminal ways. However, he is captivated by Annabel Adams, the daughter of a wealthy banker, and decides to change his ways and live an honest life. Jimmy opens a shoe store in the town and gains the respect of the community. He and Annabel become engaged to be married. One day, Ben Price, a detective who had been tracking Jimmy, arrives in town. Jimmy's identity remains intact, and he is able to save a young girl trapped in a bank vault, revealing his true skills as a safecracker. Ben Price, however, leaves without recognizing him. Jimmy continues to live an honest life and plans to move out west after he is married.",s82
The Hostage,Amelia Gray,"Nobody knew what to do at first. Deposit slips fluttered to the floor. A man touched the rim of his baseball cap to make sure it was still there.

The bank robber seemed just as shocked. There were too many people. He realized that, despite all his preparation, he hadn’t considered the afternoon rush.

“Put your hands up,” he said, and people more or less did that. “You’re all hostages now.”

“We don’t want to be hostages,” someone said.

“That’s not how this works,” the bank robber said. “I come in, you all become hostages, I get some money and leave, and then you’re free again.”

“We’re afraid,” someone else said.

The bank robber got it—he was also afraid.

A bank teller waved her hand, which was still raised above her head. “I’ll be the hostage,” she said.

“You are already one of many hostages,” the bank robber said.

“Then everyone can go and sit in the old vault,” she said. “There’s no way to call for help in there, and it has a heavy iron door. That means fewer people to mess things up. And I can access everything up front.”

It was a good plan and made the bank robber feel less like he had screwed up by coming in during the rush. “You’re sure there are no alert switches or emergency phones in there?”

“It’s a hundred years old,” she said. “You couldn’t get a call out of there if you tried.”

The hostages all turned to see what he would say. He shifted his gun from one hand to the other.

“Fine,” he said.

They all went to the old vault and the hostages filed in silently. There was plenty of room for them to sit or stand; they would be comfortable there. The teller turned an iron wheel to lock them in. “All right,” she said. “Let’s get to work.”

She opened every teller station using keys on a ring she kept at her waist. He watched her stack the money in a duffelbag, one of two he had brought for the purpose. He was grateful for her knowledge and assistance, if a little unsettled that she was offering it all so freely.

“You’re not putting a dye pack in there, are you?” he asked.

The woman turned to look at him, and he was surprised to see that his question seemed to have wounded her. “I would never,” she said. “What would make you say that?”

“I’m sorry.” He tried to think about what would make him say it; he had seen a dye pack in a movie once and knew that it could explode and make a terrible mess. There was a lot that he didn’t know about robbing banks, and every moment was another opportunity to reveal his ignorance.

She seemed to sense his hesitation and plucked a pen from one of the teller stations, rolling it across the counter toward him. “Why don’t you go sit down over there and draft a taunting letter to the police,” she said. She pointed to the mortgage officers’ desks, which ringed the lobby.

He pulled back the leather chair behind one of the desks and sat. It felt funny to be behind a desk, dressed as he was in black fatigues. The bank robber couldn’t remember the last time he’d sat behind any desk, and he’d certainly never been near one this nice. He stared at the empty page. Writing had never interested him in school; though he knew he had something to say, it gave him an uneasy feeling. He put his gun in the outgoing-mail tray and dumped a box of paper clips onto the desk.

The woman noticed him stringing paper clips together. “You could start with, ‘Fuck you, pigs, dumb motherfuckers,’ ” she said. “Or, if you want it to be more personal, you could try, like, ‘I’m the motherfucking heist king and you know it.’ It depends on the tone you want.”

“Motherfucking heist king,” he repeated, writing it down.

“You’re welcome.”

“Yes,” he said, a little annoyed. “Thank you.”

He printed “Motherfucking Heist King” at the top of the page, then wrote it again and again, trying out different handwriting styles and lining the paper with a chain-link pattern. “Motherfucking Heist King”—it really was a nice phrase. Maybe if he could make a design with it, they would get the point of what he was trying to say. What was he trying to say, anyway? He realized that he hadn’t actually considered writing a letter until it was suggested to him.

After a while, the teller came out from behind the counter to get his other bag. She looked over his shoulder at the page, which by then was covered in designs of his own creation. “Want me to write it?” she asked.

He handed her the paper and stood, surprised to find himself so irritated at someone who seemed only to want to help him. Walking to one of the high windows, he saw that a few police cars had begun to gather. “Maybe I should go,” he said.

She went back behind the counter with a pointed sigh and started to fill the second bag. He watched her poking around the cabinets. Outside, the police were setting up a barricade.

“I’m going as fast as I can,” the teller said. She sounded angry. “I have to write your stupid letter and pack up this cash and get everything organized. I’m only one person.”

“I didn’t say anything.”

“This obviously isn’t about me,” she said. “I’ve seen this a million times before. You come in here for a little quick cash, you want to make a getaway. Am I wrong?”

“You’re the bitch who volunteered.”

“Wow,” she said. “I guess I must have said something to deserve that.”

She sounded exactly like his mother, which the bank robber realized was just typical.

“Maybe you should go and get in the vault now,” he said. “You’ve helped me out. I appreciate you. I can take it from here.”

“Yeah, right,” she said. “You think I’d let you finish this alone? I’ve done too much for you already to just walk away. I’m in it for the long haul.” She threw the last stacks of cash into the duffel so hard that it slid off the counter, sending its contents spilling across the floor.

He turned back to the window. If he just stayed out of her way, it would be over soon enough.

Grumbling, she crouched down to clean it all up. At the very least, she figured, he could have helped when the bag fell. Thinking of others clearly wasn’t in his nature. She was actually getting pretty tired of his attitude: his inability to speak up, his dismal lack of self-confidence, his unwillingness to take a stand with either the hostages or the police. He didn’t have a point of view or an exit strategy, was content to remain in limbo. It was pathetic, really.

When he approached the counter, the blank look on his face sickened her; it was the look of a man completely unable to understand the future or to confront it.

“What?” he asked.

She slid the bag across the counter and spread her arms wide, levelling upon him the full power of her scorn. “You might as well just fucking shoot me,” she said.","In this story, a bank robber attempts to rob a bank during the afternoon rush. However, he quickly realizes that he hadn't considered the number of people in the bank. The bank teller suggests that they all go into the old vault, where there are no alert switches or emergency phones. Reluctantly, the bank robber agrees, and they all move into the vault.

Inside the vault, the bank teller assists the bank robber in collecting the money. She opens every teller station and stacks the money in bags. The bank robber, unsure of what to do, starts stringing paper clips together and is advised by the teller to write a taunting letter to the police. He starts writing ""Motherfucking Heist King"" repeatedly on the paper.

As time goes on, the bank robber becomes irritated and contemplates leaving. The bank teller becomes angry, feeling unappreciated and disrespected. She confronts the bank robber, comparing him to her own mother and expressing her frustration at his lack of determination and confidence.

In response, the bank robber suggests that she goes into the vault and leaves him to finish the robbery alone. However, the bank teller refuses, stating that she has done too much to just walk away. She throws the last stacks of cash into the bag, causing it to spill on the floor.

The bank robber, feeling overwhelmed, turns away and looks out the window. The bank teller continues to clean up the spilled money, growing tired of the bank robber's attitude and lack of initiative. She confronts him, suggesting that he might as well shoot her if he lacks the ability to confront the future or take a stand.

The story highlights the unexpected dynamics and character development between the bank robber and the bank teller during the course of the robbery.","In this story, a bank robber enters a bank during the afternoon rush and realizes that he hadn't considered the number of people inside. He declares everyone as hostages, but one bank teller proposes a plan to lock them all in the old vault to minimize complications.

Inside the vault, the bank teller efficiently gathers the money while the bank robber starts stringing paper clips together. The teller suggests he write a taunting letter to the police, and he begins writing ""Motherfucking Heist King"" repeatedly, inspired by the phrase. However, he soon realizes that he hadn't considered writing a letter before.

The bank teller helps him with the letter, but tensions arise between them. The bank robber suggests that maybe he should leave, but the teller insists on staying to help him. The bank robber becomes irritated, comparing the teller's behavior to that of his mother.
