Grant takes her to Meadowlake, a care facility for the elderly. Fiona befriends a man named Aubrey, who is also staying at Meadowlake. Eventually, Fiona's condition worsens and she forgets Grant, mistaking him for a visitor. Grant tries to reconnect with her, but Fiona is focused on her relationship with Aubrey. Grant visits Aubrey's wife, Marian, and asks if Aubrey can visit Fiona, but Marian refuses. Grant realizes that he may not be able to help Fiona and begins to question their relationship. He receives a call from Marian inviting him to a dance for singles, and he contemplates the possibilities of starting a relationship with her. However, when he returns to Meadowlake, he finds Fiona sitting by the window and they share a tender moment, reminding Grant that he still cares deeply for his wife and vows to stick by her side.\n"
