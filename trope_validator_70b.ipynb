       " 'The cause of all bad happenings in a story. A Big Bad could be a character with Evil Plans or it could be an omnipresent situation, such as a comet heading towards the Earth. In a serial story, the Big Bad exerts an effect across a number of episodes, even an entire season.\\nThis trope is not a catch-all term for the biggest, ugliest villain of any given story. In fact, it doesn\\'t have to be a villain at all, as we just said. If it is a villain, though, it should be identified correctly; the badass leader of the outlaw gang that causes the most personal trouble is not the Big Bad. The railroad tycoon who is using the gang as muscle is the Big Bad. The Man Behind the Man is very common for this trope, leaving the reveal of the big bad as The Chessmaster behind it all and proving themselves far more clever and resourceful than the Villain of the Week. Sometimes the Big Bad is the grand enemy of an entire franchise as an Overarching Villain. At other times, the Big Bad is an Arc Villain who causes trouble for a period of time only to be replaced by another Big Bad.\\nWhen you look at a season-long story or a major Story Arc and you can identify one problem being the cause of everything, that is the Big Bad. In its most general form, a Big Bad will be at the center of the Myth Arc rather than just any Story Arc.\\nThe term \"Big Bad\" was popularized in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It was characteristic of Buffy\\'s Big Bads for their identity or nature, or even the fact that they are the Big Bad at all, to remain unclear for a considerable time. Occasionally, characters would even refer to themselves as \"the Big Bad\". Whether or not they were, though, this is a Big Bad Wannabe. The structure of Buffy placed the Big Bad as being crucial to the Half-Arc Season, half the episodes are filler dealing with unrelated enemies while the other half involved the ongoing Myth Arc with the Big Bad. Each season can easily be defined by who the Big Bad was.\\nIf a show has a series of Big Bad jeopardies, they can function like a series of Monsters of the Week that take more than one week to finish off. If there is a Legion of Doom, you can expect the Big Bad to be involved somehow. They\\'re probably sorted by power, with the strongest for last, following the Sorting Algorithm of Evil.\\nEvil Overlord, Diabolical Mastermind, The Chessmaster, Arch-Enemy, The Man Behind the Man, and often Manipulative Bastard are specific types of villains who are liable to show up as Big Bads. If they\\'re a Magnificent Bastard or Hero Killer, the good guys are in big trouble. The heroic counterpart of this character is the Big Good, who will very often be the focus of this character\\'s attention over The Hero at the beginning of a series. If a work of fiction is conspicuously lacking a Big Bad, it may be a case of No Antagonist.\\nSee also Big Bad Duumvirate for two (or more) Big Bads working together. Sometimes a Big Bad will get their start as a servant to another villain — if that\\'s the case, they\\'re a Dragon Ascendant. If the character who fills the role of Big Bad in most meaningful ways is nominally subordinate to someone else (someone significantly less menacing by comparison), they are a Dragon-in-Chief. If the story has many Big Bads at once who don\\'t work together, see Big-Bad Ensemble. The Big Bad Shuffle occurs when there are multiple candidates for the Big Bad position. If the Big Bad doesn\\'t start out as bad but develops over the course of the story, it\\'s Big Bad Slippage. If the Big Bad of one section of a work doesn\\'t die on being defeated and stays around as a character in a different plot role (reformed or not), that\\'s Ex-Big Bad.\\nThe Big Bad of a story is not always the most powerful or oldest existing evil force. Perhaps an evil presence along the lines of an Eldritch Abomination overshadows the work\\'s setting, but is mainly divorced from the story\\'s events — that would be the Greater-Scope Villain.\\nIt is one of the most well-known tropes on the TV Tropes community, being the first to have over forty thousand wicks, and is the most wicked trope. This is probably because it\\'s incredibly common.')"

       "'. What are some examples of vampires in fiction that subvert or play with common vampire tropes?\\n\\nOurVampiresAreDifferent is a popular trope in fiction that involves reimagining or subverting common vampire tropes. Here are some examples of vampires in fiction that play with or subvert common vampire tropes:\\n\\n1. The Vampire Lestat from Anne Rice\\'s \"Vampire Chronicles\" series: Lestat is a charismatic, flamboyant, and rebellious vampire who defies many traditional vampire tropes. He walks in sunlight, doesn\\'t have fangs, and doesn\\'t drink human blood. Instead, he feeds on rats and other small animals.\\n2. The vampires in \"The Strain\" by Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan: These vampires are more like zombies than traditional vampires. They are created by a virus that turns people into mindless, bloodthirsty creatures with no supernatural powers.\\n3. The vampires in \"True Blood\" by Charlaine Harris: These vampires have \"come out of the coffin\" and are living openly among humans. They have their own government, laws, and social norms, and they can drink synthetic blood instead of human blood.\\n4. The vampires in \"The Vampire Diaries\" by L.J. Smith: These vampires have the ability to control their bloodlust and can choose not to drink human blood. They also have a range of supernatural powers, such as the ability to compel humans and manipulate the elements.\\n5. The vampires in \"The Dresden Files\" by Jim Butcher: These vampires are divided into different factions, each with their own unique powers and weaknesses. They are not automatically evil, and some of them even work with the series\\' protagonist, Harry Dresden, a wizard, to fight against greater evils.\\n6. The vampires in \"The Night Circus\" by Erin Morgenstern: These vampires are part of a magical circus that appears only at night. They are not bloodthirsty monsters but rather charismatic performers who use their immortality to perfect their art.\\n7. The vampires in \"Penny Dreadful\" by John Logan: These vampires are inspired by Bram Stoker\\'s \"Dracula\" but with a twist. They are not monstrous beings but rather complex characters with their own motivations and backstories.\\n8. The vampires in \"What We Do in the Shadows\" by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi: These vampires are comedic and relatable, struggling to navigate modern life in Wellington, New Zealand. They are not bloodthirsty monsters but rather lovable misfits who want to fit in with human society.\\n9. The vampires in \"The Radleys\" by Matt Haig: These vampires are a dysfunctional family who are trying to live a normal suburban life. They have to navigate their vampire urges while also dealing with the usual struggles of family life.\\n10. The vampires in \"The Passage\" by Justin Cronin: These vampires are the result of a government experiment gone wrong. They are not undead creatures but rather humans infected with a virus that gives them supernatural powers but also turns them into monstrous beings.\\n\\nThese examples show how OurVampiresAreDifferent trope can be used to create fresh and exciting takes on the traditional vampire lore, allowing authors to explore new themes and ideas while still drawing on the rich history of vampire mythology.'"

      "Just behind the kingdom that failed ran a nice little river. It was a clear, lovely stream, and many fish lived in it. Weeds grew there, too, and the fish ate the weeds. The fish didn’t care whether or not the kingdom had failed, of course. Whether it was a kingdom or a republic made no difference to them. They didn’t vote or pay taxes. Makes no difference to us, they figured.\n",
      "\n",
      "I washed my feet in the stream. A short soak in the icy-cold water turned them red. From the stream, you could see the walls and the tower of the castle in the kingdom that failed. The two-colored flag still flew from the tower, fluttering in the breeze. Everyone passing along the riverbanks would see the flag and say, “Hey, look at that. It’s the flag of the kingdom that failed.”\n",

      "Q and I are friends—or should I say, were friends in college. It’s been more than ten years since the two of us did anything that friends do. Which is why I use the past tense. Anyhow, we were friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever I try to tell anyone about Q—to describe him as a person—I feel totally helpless. I’ve never been very good at explaining anything, but, even taking that into account, it’s a special challenge to try to explain Q to someone. And when I do try I’m overcome by a deep, deep sense of despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me make this as simple as I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q and I are the same age, but he’s about five hundred and seventy times more handsome. He has a nice personality, too. He’s never pushy or boastful, and he never gets angry if someone accidentally causes a problem for him. “Oh, well,” he’ll say. “I’ve done the same thing myself.” But, in fact, I’ve never heard of him doing anything bad to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was well brought up, too. His father was a doctor who had his own clinic on the island of Shikoku, which meant that Q never wanted for pocket money. Not that he was extravagant with it. He was a smart dresser and also an impressive athlete, who’d played interscholastic tennis in high school. He enjoyed swimming and went to the pool at least twice a week. Politically, he was a moderate liberal. His grades, if not outstanding, were at least good. He almost never studied for exams, but he never failed a course. He really listened to the lectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was surprisingly talented on the piano, and he owned a lot of Bill Evans and Mozart records. His favorite writers tended to be French—Balzac and Maupassant. Sometimes he’d read a novel by Kenzaburo Oe or another writer. His critiques were always right on the mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was popular with women, naturally enough. But he was not one of those “anyone he can get his hands on” type of guys. He had a steady girlfriend, a pretty sophomore from one of the fancy women’s colleges. They went out every Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyhow, that was the Q I knew in college. In short, he was a character without flaws.\n",
      "\n",

Additionally, he is described as being well-dressed and having an impressive athlete, and he enjoys swimming and listening to classical music. The story also highlights Q's integrity and sense, as he tries to explain the situation to the woman in a sincere and respectful manner, showing that he is not just a shallow jock but a complex character.

However, the story does not explicitly state that Q is a vampire, leaving his nature ambiguous and open to interpretation.

The story also references real-world places and cultures, such as the island of Shikoku and the city of Akasaka, which could be seen as a fantasy version of Japan.

The story's tone is also somewhat humorous, with the woman throwing a Coke at Q and the narrator making wry observations about the situation, which is another hallmark of fantasy. Finally, the story's title, \"The Kingdom That Failed,\" suggests that it is meant to be a cautionary tale or an allegory, which are common features of fantasy stories.

      "Story:\n",
      "Just behind the kingdom that failed ran a nice little river. It was a clear, lovely stream, and many fish lived in it. Weeds grew there, too, and the fish ate the weeds. The fish didn’t care whether or not the kingdom had failed, of course. Whether it was a kingdom or a republic made no difference to them. They didn’t vote or pay taxes. Makes no difference to us, they figured.\n",
      "\n",
      "I washed my feet in the stream. A short soak in the icy-cold water turned them red. From the stream, you could see the walls and the tower of the castle in the kingdom that failed. The two-colored flag still flew from the tower, fluttering in the breeze. Everyone passing along the riverbanks would see the flag and say, “Hey, look at that. It’s the flag of the kingdom that failed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Q and I are friends—or should I say, were friends in college. It’s been more than ten years since the two of us did anything that friends do. Which is why I use the past tense. Anyhow, we were friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever I try to tell anyone about Q—to describe him as a person—I feel totally helpless. I’ve never been very good at explaining anything, but, even taking that into account, it’s a special challenge to try to explain Q to someone. And when I do try I’m overcome by a deep, deep sense of despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me make this as simple as I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q and I are the same age, but he’s about five hundred and seventy times more handsome. He has a nice personality, too. He’s never pushy or boastful, and he never gets angry if someone accidentally causes a problem for him. “Oh, well,” he’ll say. “I’ve done the same thing myself.” But, in fact, I’ve never heard of him doing anything bad to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was well brought up, too. His father was a doctor who had his own clinic on the island of Shikoku, which meant that Q never wanted for pocket money. Not that he was extravagant with it. He was a smart dresser and also an impressive athlete, who’d played interscholastic tennis in high school. He enjoyed swimming and went to the pool at least twice a week. Politically, he was a moderate liberal. His grades, if not outstanding, were at least good. He almost never studied for exams, but he never failed a course. He really listened to the lectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was surprisingly talented on the piano, and he owned a lot of Bill Evans and Mozart records. His favorite writers tended to be French—Balzac and Maupassant. Sometimes he’d read a novel by Kenzaburo Oe or another writer. His critiques were always right on the mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was popular with women, naturally enough. But he was not one of those “anyone he can get his hands on” type of guys. He had a steady girlfriend, a pretty sophomore from one of the fancy women’s colleges. They went out every Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyhow, that was the Q I knew in college. In short, he was a character without flaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back then, Q lived in the apartment next door to mine. What with lending salt or borrowing salad dressing, we got to be friends, and soon we were at each other’s places all the time, listening to records, drinking beer. Once, my girlfriend and I drove out to the Kamakura shore with Q and his girlfriend. We were very comfortable together. Then, during the summer break of my senior year, I moved out, and that was that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next time I saw Q, almost a decade had gone by. I was reading a book by a swanky hotel pool near the Akasaka district. Q was sitting in the deck chair next to mine, and beside him was a beautiful long-legged woman in a bikini.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew right away that it was Q. He was as handsome as ever, and now, just over thirty, he evinced a certain dignity that he hadn’t had before. Young women walking by gave him a quick once-over.\n",
      "\n",
      "He didn’t notice me sitting next to him. I’m a fairly ordinary-looking guy, and I was wearing sunglasses. I wasn’t sure whether I should talk to him, but in the end I decided not to. He and the woman were deep in conversation, and I hesitated to interrupt them. Besides, there wasn’t a lot that he and I could have talked about. “I lent you salt, remember?” “Hey, that’s right, and I borrowed a bottle of salad dressing.” We would have run out of topics quickly. So I kept my mouth shut and stuck to my book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I couldn’t help overhearing what Q and his pretty companion were saying to each other. It was a fairly complicated matter. I gave up trying to read and listened to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No way,” the woman said. “You’ve got to be kidding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know, I know,” Q said. “I know exactly what you’re saying. But you’ve got to see it my way, too. I’m not doing this because I want to. It was the guys upstairs. I’m just telling you what they decided. So don’t look at me that way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yeah, right,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q let out a sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me summarize their long conversation—filling in a good deal by way of imagination, of course. Q seemed to be now a director at a TV station or some such place, and the woman was a moderately well-known singer or actress. She was being let go from a project because of some sort of trouble or scandal she had become involved in, or maybe just because her popularity had declined. The job of informing her had been left to Q, who was the person most directly responsible for day-to-day operations. I don’t know much about the entertainment industry, so I can’t be sure of the finer points, but I don’t think I’m too far off over all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judging from what I heard, Q was discharging his duty with genuine sincerity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can’t survive without sponsors,” he said. “I don’t have to tell you that—you know the business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you’re telling me that you don’t have any responsibility or say in the matter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I’m not telling you that. But what I can do is really limited.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Their conversation took another turn into a dead-end street. She wanted to know just how much he had exerted himself on her behalf. He insisted that he had done everything he could, but he had no way to prove it, and she didn’t believe him. I didn’t really believe him, either. The more sincerely he tried to explain things, the more a fog of insincerity came to hang over everything. But it wasn’t Q’s fault. It wasn’t anybody’s fault. Which was why there was no way out of this conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared that the woman had always liked Q. I sensed that they had got along well until this business came up. Which probably only added to the woman’s anger. In the end, though, she was the one who gave in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O.K.,” she said. “I’ve had it. Buy me a Coke, will you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he heard that, Q breathed a sigh of relief and went off to the drink stand. The woman put on her sunglasses and stared straight ahead. By this time, I had read the same line in my book a couple hundred times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, Q came back with two big paper cups. Handing one to the woman, he lowered himself into his deck chair. “Don’t get too depressed about this,” he said. “Any day now you’ll—”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, before he could finish, the woman threw her full cup at him. It caught him square in the face, and about a third of the Coca-Cola splashed onto me. Without a word, the woman stood up and, giving a little yank at the seat of her bikini, strode off without a backward glance. Q and I just sat there stunned for a good fifteen seconds. The people nearby were staring at us in shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q was the first to regain his composure. “Sorry,” he said and held a towel out to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s O.K.,” I answered. “I’ll just take a shower.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking slightly annoyed, he drew the towel back and used it to dry himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At least let me pay for the book,” he said. It was true that my book was soaked. But it was just a cheap paperback, and not a very interesting one at that. Anyone who threw a Coke on it and prevented me from reading it was doing me a favor. He brightened up when I said that. He had the same great smile as always.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q left at that point, apologizing to me once more as he stood to go. He had never realized who I was.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to give this story the title “The Kingdom That Failed” because I happened to read an article in the evening paper that day about an African kingdom that had failed. “To see a splendid kingdom fade away,” it said, “is far sadder than seeing a second-rate republic collapse.” [/INST]  {\n",

      "('Just behind the kingdom that failed ran a nice little river. It was a clear, lovely stream, and many fish lived in it. Weeds grew there, too, and the fish ate the weeds. The fish didn’t care whether or not the kingdom had failed, of course. Whether it was a kingdom or a republic made no difference to them. They didn’t vote or pay taxes. Makes no difference to us, they figured.\\n\\nI washed my feet in the stream. A short soak in the icy-cold water turned them red. From the stream, you could see the walls and the tower of the castle in the kingdom that failed. The two-colored flag still flew from the tower, fluttering in the breeze. Everyone passing along the riverbanks would see the flag and say, “Hey, look at that. It’s the flag of the kingdom that failed.”\\n\\nQ and I are friends—or should I say, were friends in college. It’s been more than ten years since the two of us did anything that friends do. Which is why I use the past tense. Anyhow, we were friends.\\n\\nWhenever I try to tell anyone about Q—to describe him as a person—I feel totally helpless. I’ve never been very good at explaining anything, but, even taking that into account, it’s a special challenge to try to explain Q to someone. And when I do try I’m overcome by a deep, deep sense of despair.\\n\\nLet me make this as simple as I can.\\n\\nQ and I are the same age, but he’s about five hundred and seventy times more handsome. He has a nice personality, too. He’s never pushy or boastful, and he never gets angry if someone accidentally causes a problem for him. “Oh, well,” he’ll say. “I’ve done the same thing myself.” But, in fact, I’ve never heard of him doing anything bad to anyone.\\n\\nHe was well brought up, too. His father was a doctor who had his own clinic on the island of Shikoku, which meant that Q never wanted for pocket money. Not that he was extravagant with it. He was a smart dresser and also an impressive athlete, who’d played interscholastic tennis in high school. He enjoyed swimming and went to the pool at least twice a week. Politically, he was a moderate liberal. His grades, if not outstanding, were at least good. He almost never studied for exams, but he never failed a course. He really listened to the lectures.\\n\\nHe was surprisingly talented on the piano, and he owned a lot of Bill Evans and Mozart records. His favorite writers tended to be French—Balzac and Maupassant. Sometimes he’d read a novel by Kenzaburo Oe or another writer. His critiques were always right on the mark.\\n\\nHe was popular with women, naturally enough. But he was not one of those “anyone he can get his hands on” type of guys. He had a steady girlfriend, a pretty sophomore from one of the fancy women’s colleges. They went out every Sunday.\\n\\nAnyhow, that was the Q I knew in college. In short, he was a character without flaws.\\n\\nBack then, Q lived in the apartment next door to mine. What with lending salt or borrowing salad dressing, we got to be friends, and soon we were at each other’s places all the time, listening to records, drinking beer. Once, my girlfriend and I drove out to the Kamakura shore with Q and his girlfriend. We were very comfortable together. Then, during the summer break of my senior year, I moved out, and that was that.\\n\\nThe next time I saw Q, almost a decade had gone by. I was reading a book by a swanky hotel pool near the Akasaka district. Q was sitting in the deck chair next to mine, and beside him was a beautiful long-legged woman in a bikini.\\n\\nI knew right away that it was Q. He was as handsome as ever, and now, just over thirty, he evinced a certain dignity that he hadn’t had before. Young women walking by gave him a quick once-over.\\n\\nHe didn’t notice me sitting next to him. I’m a fairly ordinary-looking guy, and I was wearing sunglasses. I wasn’t sure whether I should talk to him, but in the end I decided not to. He and the woman were deep in conversation, and I hesitated to interrupt them. Besides, there wasn’t a lot that he and I could have talked about. “I lent you salt, remember?” “Hey, that’s right, and I borrowed a bottle of salad dressing.” We would have run out of topics quickly. So I kept my mouth shut and stuck to my book.\\n\\nStill, I couldn’t help overhearing what Q and his pretty companion were saying to each other. It was a fairly complicated matter. I gave up trying to read and listened to them.\\n\\n“No way,” the woman said. “You’ve got to be kidding.”\\n\\n“I know, I know,” Q said. “I know exactly what you’re saying. But you’ve got to see it my way, too. I’m not doing this because I want to. It was the guys upstairs. I’m just telling you what they decided. So don’t look at me that way.”\\n\\n“Yeah, right,” she said.\\n\\nQ let out a sigh.\\n\\nLet me summarize their long conversation—filling in a good deal by way of imagination, of course. Q seemed to be now a director at a TV station or some such place, and the woman was a moderately well-known singer or actress. She was being let go from a project because of some sort of trouble or scandal she had become involved in, or maybe just because her popularity had declined. The job of informing her had been left to Q, who was the person most directly responsible for day-to-day operations. I don’t know much about the entertainment industry, so I can’t be sure of the finer points, but I don’t think I’m too far off over all.\\n\\nJudging from what I heard, Q was discharging his duty with genuine sincerity.\\n\\n“We can’t survive without sponsors,” he said. “I don’t have to tell you that—you know the business.”\\n\\n“So you’re telling me that you don’t have any responsibility or say in the matter?”\\n\\n“No, I’m not telling you that. But what I can do is really limited.”\\n\\nTheir conversation took another turn into a dead-end street. She wanted to know just how much he had exerted himself on her behalf. He insisted that he had done everything he could, but he had no way to prove it, and she didn’t believe him. I didn’t really believe him, either. The more sincerely he tried to explain things, the more a fog of insincerity came to hang over everything. But it wasn’t Q’s fault. It wasn’t anybody’s fault. Which was why there was no way out of this conversation.\\n\\nIt appeared that the woman had always liked Q. I sensed that they had got along well until this business came up. Which probably only added to the woman’s anger. In the end, though, she was the one who gave in.\\n\\n“O.K.,” she said. “I’ve had it. Buy me a Coke, will you?”\\n\\nWhen he heard that, Q breathed a sigh of relief and went off to the drink stand. The woman put on her sunglasses and stared straight ahead. By this time, I had read the same line in my book a couple hundred times.\\n\\nSoon, Q came back with two big paper cups. Handing one to the woman, he lowered himself into his deck chair. “Don’t get too depressed about this,” he said. “Any day now you’ll—”\\n\\nBut, before he could finish, the woman threw her full cup at him. It caught him square in the face, and about a third of the Coca-Cola splashed onto me. Without a word, the woman stood up and, giving a little yank at the seat of her bikini, strode off without a backward glance. Q and I just sat there stunned for a good fifteen seconds. The people nearby were staring at us in shock.\\n\\nQ was the first to regain his composure. “Sorry,” he said and held a towel out to me.\\n\\n“That’s O.K.,” I answered. “I’ll just take a shower.”\\n\\nLooking slightly annoyed, he drew the towel back and used it to dry himself.\\n\\n“At least let me pay for the book,” he said. It was true that my book was soaked. But it was just a cheap paperback, and not a very interesting one at that. Anyone who threw a Coke on it and prevented me from reading it was doing me a favor. He brightened up when I said that. He had the same great smile as always.\\n\\nQ left at that point, apologizing to me once more as he stood to go. He had never realized who I was.\\n\\nI decided to give this story the title “The Kingdom That Failed” because I happened to read an article in the evening paper that day about an African kingdom that had failed. “To see a splendid kingdom fade away,” it said, “is far sadder than seeing a second-rate republic collapse.”', ['HotSkittyOnWailordAction', 'BigBad', 'ProudWarriorRaceGuy', 'OurVampiresAreDifferent', 'ShoutOut', 'FairplayWhodunnit', 'Foreshadowing', 'DramaticIrony', 'GenderBlenderName', 'FantasyCounterpartCulture'])\n",

      "('The gunman lights a cigarette, watches despondently as dusk falls upon the empty alley. He is alone in a lonely place, summoned here to receive instructions from a master criminal known only as the Boss, but the Boss isn’t here. No one is. It’s spooky. He feels like a marked man. The Boss is known for his ruthlessness. When he orders a killing, someone dies. The gunman would like there to be witnesses for what happens next, but the alley’s deserted.\\n\\nHe glances at his watch, a gift from the Boss. Face a gold coin, no numbers. A joke, probably: time is money. Or, maybe, money is time; it depends on what you’re short of. The Boss is a great joker. The watch hands are hair-thin, like the edge of a razor blade, hard to see, especially in this fading light. There and not there, like time itself. Which is perhaps not being clocked—perhaps that’s what the numberless face is saying. How can you measure the shit you’re buried in? He doesn’t know what keeps the watch running. Battery inside, maybe. When the battery dies? Don’t think about it.\\n\\nOn one assignment or another, the gunman has wasted a few suckers in alleys like this, but not many. His specialty is knocking them off in train stations and hotel lobbies or on the street in broad daylight. There’s a greater risk of getting nabbed, so always an extra thrill. Which is why he took up doing the Boss’s dirty work. Thrills remind him that he’s alive, when not much else does.\\n\\nOverhead, a street lamp comes on, its yellow light a mere stain under the dimming sky. Then a woman passes. It’s about time, the gunman thinks. Has she been sent by the Boss? Is she his witness? His victim? His executioner? His hand is inside his jacket, resting on the butt of the revolver holstered under his armpit. Probably just an innocent working girl, looking for a pickup, wandering into a place where she doesn’t belong. Which wouldn’t stop the Boss from targeting her. Or using her.\\n\\nYou looking for someone, sister? he asks, lurking in the shadows, his cigarette bobbing as he speaks.\\n\\nI don’t know, she says. She casts an inquisitive gaze at him, then quickly looks away. A signal? He should perhaps throw himself behind the trash cans, but her tender scrutiny has fixed him where he stands.\\n\\nShe walks slowly away into the shadows at the far end of the alley, then swivels and walks back again toward the light. She appears frightened, lost. Touchingly vulnerable. Above her, the street lamp sways rhythmically, causing shadows to stretch and recede, stretch and recede, like a slowly beating heart. She pauses under it and looks around, clearly thinking about something. She’s no beauty, but she has sweet ways. His hard heart softens. He takes his hand off the revolver.\\n\\nWhen she turns to walk down the alley again, the gunman flicks his cigarette away and walks with her, moving as she moves. Left, right, left . . . it’s a kind of dance. She asks if he’s making fun of her. He says he doesn’t know how to make fun. In truth, he feels caught up in something fundamental. Benumbing. A feeling he hasn’t had before. Abstract, yet oddly erotic.\\n\\nIt won’t do any good, she says, reading him.\\n\\nYeah, I know, lady. But I like it.\\n\\nThey reach the dark end of the alley, still moving together, and turn back toward the swaying street lamp. The alley seems almost to fade away, the lamp’s glow to brighten. There are bats twittering somewhere. Time itself seems to stop, even though he knows it’s still grinding inexorably toward something messy. The Boss has plans that haven’t happened yet. Never mind. Worry about them when they do.\\n\\nWhen their dance ends, night has fully descended, sharpening the contrast between the pool of lamplight they have stepped into and the rest of the world, lost in the darkness beyond. That was great, he says. She looks up at him, her face pale but radiant in the light. She nods. Her sad smile seems to say, Yes, but it’s not enough, is it? She stares down at her feet, and when she does so, her face is masked in shadow. Is she about to betray him? he wonders. Does he care?\\n\\nShe starts suddenly, glances back down the alley. He follows her gaze. Uh-oh. Something is moving. His hand, too slowly, is inside his jacket. Watch out! she cries, and throws herself in front of him. A shot rings out. She collapses into his arms. Holding her, he fires impotently into the darkness. His bullets ricochet through the alley like ironic laughter. Hang on, baby! he pleads, but it’s too late.\\n\\nIt must be . . . why . . . she whispers, and dies in his arms.\\n\\nHis heart hardens again. Rage bites at the corners of his eyes. He doesn’t understand a fucking thing.', ['t08393', 't02187', 't18297', 't03644', 't26668', 't20226', 't26723', 't15274', 't20214', 't23339'])\n",

      "('The gunman lights a cigarette, watches despondently as dusk falls upon the empty alley. He is alone in a lonely place, summoned here to receive instructions from a master criminal known only as the Boss, but the Boss isn’t here. No one is. It’s spooky. He feels like a marked man. The Boss is known for his ruthlessness. When he orders a killing, someone dies. The gunman would like there to be witnesses for what happens next, but the alley’s deserted.\\n\\nHe glances at his watch, a gift from the Boss. Face a gold coin, no numbers. A joke, probably: time is money. Or, maybe, money is time; it depends on what you’re short of. The Boss is a great joker. The watch hands are hair-thin, like the edge of a razor blade, hard to see, especially in this fading light. There and not there, like time itself. Which is perhaps not being clocked—perhaps that’s what the numberless face is saying. How can you measure the shit you’re buried in? He doesn’t know what keeps the watch running. Battery inside, maybe. When the battery dies? Don’t think about it.\\n\\nOn one assignment or another, the gunman has wasted a few suckers in alleys like this, but not many. His specialty is knocking them off in train stations and hotel lobbies or on the street in broad daylight. There’s a greater risk of getting nabbed, so always an extra thrill. Which is why he took up doing the Boss’s dirty work. Thrills remind him that he’s alive, when not much else does.\\n\\nOverhead, a street lamp comes on, its yellow light a mere stain under the dimming sky. Then a woman passes. It’s about time, the gunman thinks. Has she been sent by the Boss? Is she his witness? His victim? His executioner? His hand is inside his jacket, resting on the butt of the revolver holstered under his armpit. Probably just an innocent working girl, looking for a pickup, wandering into a place where she doesn’t belong. Which wouldn’t stop the Boss from targeting her. Or using her.\\n\\nYou looking for someone, sister? he asks, lurking in the shadows, his cigarette bobbing as he speaks.\\n\\nI don’t know, she says. She casts an inquisitive gaze at him, then quickly looks away. A signal? He should perhaps throw himself behind the trash cans, but her tender scrutiny has fixed him where he stands.\\n\\nShe walks slowly away into the shadows at the far end of the alley, then swivels and walks back again toward the light. She appears frightened, lost. Touchingly vulnerable. Above her, the street lamp sways rhythmically, causing shadows to stretch and recede, stretch and recede, like a slowly beating heart. She pauses under it and looks around, clearly thinking about something. She’s no beauty, but she has sweet ways. His hard heart softens. He takes his hand off the revolver.\\n\\nWhen she turns to walk down the alley again, the gunman flicks his cigarette away and walks with her, moving as she moves. Left, right, left . . . it’s a kind of dance. She asks if he’s making fun of her. He says he doesn’t know how to make fun. In truth, he feels caught up in something fundamental. Benumbing. A feeling he hasn’t had before. Abstract, yet oddly erotic.\\n\\nIt won’t do any good, she says, reading him.\\n\\nYeah, I know, lady. But I like it.\\n\\nThey reach the dark end of the alley, still moving together, and turn back toward the swaying street lamp. The alley seems almost to fade away, the lamp’s glow to brighten. There are bats twittering somewhere. Time itself seems to stop, even though he knows it’s still grinding inexorably toward something messy. The Boss has plans that haven’t happened yet. Never mind. Worry about them when they do.\\n\\nWhen their dance ends, night has fully descended, sharpening the contrast between the pool of lamplight they have stepped into and the rest of the world, lost in the darkness beyond. That was great, he says. She looks up at him, her face pale but radiant in the light. She nods. Her sad smile seems to say, Yes, but it’s not enough, is it? She stares down at her feet, and when she does so, her face is masked in shadow. Is she about to betray him? he wonders. Does he care?\\n\\nShe starts suddenly, glances back down the alley. He follows her gaze. Uh-oh. Something is moving. His hand, too slowly, is inside his jacket. Watch out! she cries, and throws herself in front of him. A shot rings out. She collapses into his arms. Holding her, he fires impotently into the darkness. His bullets ricochet through the alley like ironic laughter. Hang on, baby! he pleads, but it’s too late.\\n\\nIt must be . . . why . . . she whispers, and dies in his arms.\\n\\nHis heart hardens again. Rage bites at the corners of his eyes. He doesn’t understand a fucking thing.', ['t08393', 't02187', 't18297', 't03644', 't26668', 't20226', 't26723', 't15274', 't20214', 't23339'])\n",

      "('The gunman lights a cigarette, watches despondently as dusk falls upon the empty alley. He is alone in a lonely place, summoned here to receive instructions from a master criminal known only as the Boss, but the Boss isn’t here. No one is. It’s spooky. He feels like a marked man. The Boss is known for his ruthlessness. When he orders a killing, someone dies. The gunman would like there to be witnesses for what happens next, but the alley’s deserted.\\n\\nHe glances at his watch, a gift from the Boss. Face a gold coin, no numbers. A joke, probably: time is money. Or, maybe, money is time; it depends on what you’re short of. The Boss is a great joker. The watch hands are hair-thin, like the edge of a razor blade, hard to see, especially in this fading light. There and not there, like time itself. Which is perhaps not being clocked—perhaps that’s what the numberless face is saying. How can you measure the shit you’re buried in? He doesn’t know what keeps the watch running. Battery inside, maybe. When the battery dies? Don’t think about it.\\n\\nOn one assignment or another, the gunman has wasted a few suckers in alleys like this, but not many. His specialty is knocking them off in train stations and hotel lobbies or on the street in broad daylight. There’s a greater risk of getting nabbed, so always an extra thrill. Which is why he took up doing the Boss’s dirty work. Thrills remind him that he’s alive, when not much else does.\\n\\nOverhead, a street lamp comes on, its yellow light a mere stain under the dimming sky. Then a woman passes. It’s about time, the gunman thinks. Has she been sent by the Boss? Is she his witness? His victim? His executioner? His hand is inside his jacket, resting on the butt of the revolver holstered under his armpit. Probably just an innocent working girl, looking for a pickup, wandering into a place where she doesn’t belong. Which wouldn’t stop the Boss from targeting her. Or using her.\\n\\nYou looking for someone, sister? he asks, lurking in the shadows, his cigarette bobbing as he speaks.\\n\\nI don’t know, she says. She casts an inquisitive gaze at him, then quickly looks away. A signal? He should perhaps throw himself behind the trash cans, but her tender scrutiny has fixed him where he stands.\\n\\nShe walks slowly away into the shadows at the far end of the alley, then swivels and walks back again toward the light. She appears frightened, lost. Touchingly vulnerable. Above her, the street lamp sways rhythmically, causing shadows to stretch and recede, stretch and recede, like a slowly beating heart. She pauses under it and looks around, clearly thinking about something. She’s no beauty, but she has sweet ways. His hard heart softens. He takes his hand off the revolver.\\n\\nWhen she turns to walk down the alley again, the gunman flicks his cigarette away and walks with her, moving as she moves. Left, right, left . . . it’s a kind of dance. She asks if he’s making fun of her. He says he doesn’t know how to make fun. In truth, he feels caught up in something fundamental. Benumbing. A feeling he hasn’t had before. Abstract, yet oddly erotic.\\n\\nIt won’t do any good, she says, reading him.\\n\\nYeah, I know, lady. But I like it.\\n\\nThey reach the dark end of the alley, still moving together, and turn back toward the swaying street lamp. The alley seems almost to fade away, the lamp’s glow to brighten. There are bats twittering somewhere. Time itself seems to stop, even though he knows it’s still grinding inexorably toward something messy. The Boss has plans that haven’t happened yet. Never mind. Worry about them when they do.\\n\\nWhen their dance ends, night has fully descended, sharpening the contrast between the pool of lamplight they have stepped into and the rest of the world, lost in the darkness beyond. That was great, he says. She looks up at him, her face pale but radiant in the light. She nods. Her sad smile seems to say, Yes, but it’s not enough, is it? She stares down at her feet, and when she does so, her face is masked in shadow. Is she about to betray him? he wonders. Does he care?\\n\\nShe starts suddenly, glances back down the alley. He follows her gaze. Uh-oh. Something is moving. His hand, too slowly, is inside his jacket. Watch out! she cries, and throws herself in front of him. A shot rings out. She collapses into his arms. Holding her, he fires impotently into the darkness. His bullets ricochet through the alley like ironic laughter. Hang on, baby! he pleads, but it’s too late.\\n\\nIt must be . . . why . . . she whispers, and dies in his arms.\\n\\nHis heart hardens again. Rage bites at the corners of his eyes. He doesn’t understand a fucking thing.', ['t08393', 't02187', 't18297', 't03644', 't26668', 't20226', 't26723', 't15274', 't20214', 't23339'])\n",

      "('The gunman lights a cigarette, watches despondently as dusk falls upon the empty alley. He is alone in a lonely place, summoned here to receive instructions from a master criminal known only as the Boss, but the Boss isn’t here. No one is. It’s spooky. He feels like a marked man. The Boss is known for his ruthlessness. When he orders a killing, someone dies. The gunman would like there to be witnesses for what happens next, but the alley’s deserted.\\n\\nHe glances at his watch, a gift from the Boss. Face a gold coin, no numbers. A joke, probably: time is money. Or, maybe, money is time; it depends on what you’re short of. The Boss is a great joker. The watch hands are hair-thin, like the edge of a razor blade, hard to see, especially in this fading light. There and not there, like time itself. Which is perhaps not being clocked—perhaps that’s what the numberless face is saying. How can you measure the shit you’re buried in? He doesn’t know what keeps the watch running. Battery inside, maybe. When the battery dies? Don’t think about it.\\n\\nOn one assignment or another, the gunman has wasted a few suckers in alleys like this, but not many. His specialty is knocking them off in train stations and hotel lobbies or on the street in broad daylight. There’s a greater risk of getting nabbed, so always an extra thrill. Which is why he took up doing the Boss’s dirty work. Thrills remind him that he’s alive, when not much else does.\\n\\nOverhead, a street lamp comes on, its yellow light a mere stain under the dimming sky. Then a woman passes. It’s about time, the gunman thinks. Has she been sent by the Boss? Is she his witness? His victim? His executioner? His hand is inside his jacket, resting on the butt of the revolver holstered under his armpit. Probably just an innocent working girl, looking for a pickup, wandering into a place where she doesn’t belong. Which wouldn’t stop the Boss from targeting her. Or using her.\\n\\nYou looking for someone, sister? he asks, lurking in the shadows, his cigarette bobbing as he speaks.\\n\\nI don’t know, she says. She casts an inquisitive gaze at him, then quickly looks away. A signal? He should perhaps throw himself behind the trash cans, but her tender scrutiny has fixed him where he stands.\\n\\nShe walks slowly away into the shadows at the far end of the alley, then swivels and walks back again toward the light. She appears frightened, lost. Touchingly vulnerable. Above her, the street lamp sways rhythmically, causing shadows to stretch and recede, stretch and recede, like a slowly beating heart. She pauses under it and looks around, clearly thinking about something. She’s no beauty, but she has sweet ways. His hard heart softens. He takes his hand off the revolver.\\n\\nWhen she turns to walk down the alley again, the gunman flicks his cigarette away and walks with her, moving as she moves. Left, right, left . . . it’s a kind of dance. She asks if he’s making fun of her. He says he doesn’t know how to make fun. In truth, he feels caught up in something fundamental. Benumbing. A feeling he hasn’t had before. Abstract, yet oddly erotic.\\n\\nIt won’t do any good, she says, reading him.\\n\\nYeah, I know, lady. But I like it.\\n\\nThey reach the dark end of the alley, still moving together, and turn back toward the swaying street lamp. The alley seems almost to fade away, the lamp’s glow to brighten. There are bats twittering somewhere. Time itself seems to stop, even though he knows it’s still grinding inexorably toward something messy. The Boss has plans that haven’t happened yet. Never mind. Worry about them when they do.\\n\\nWhen their dance ends, night has fully descended, sharpening the contrast between the pool of lamplight they have stepped into and the rest of the world, lost in the darkness beyond. That was great, he says. She looks up at him, her face pale but radiant in the light. She nods. Her sad smile seems to say, Yes, but it’s not enough, is it? She stares down at her feet, and when she does so, her face is masked in shadow. Is she about to betray him? he wonders. Does he care?\\n\\nShe starts suddenly, glances back down the alley. He follows her gaze. Uh-oh. Something is moving. His hand, too slowly, is inside his jacket. Watch out! she cries, and throws herself in front of him. A shot rings out. She collapses into his arms. Holding her, he fires impotently into the darkness. His bullets ricochet through the alley like ironic laughter. Hang on, baby! he pleads, but it’s too late.\\n\\nIt must be . . . why . . . she whispers, and dies in his arms.\\n\\nHis heart hardens again. Rage bites at the corners of his eyes. He doesn’t understand a fucking thing.', ['t08393', 't02187', 't18297', 't03644', 't26668', 't20226', 't26723', 't15274', 't20214', 't23339'])\n",

      "('A guard came to the prison shoe-shop, where Jimmy Valentine was assiduously stitching uppers, and escorted him to the front office. There the warden handed Jimmy his pardon, which had been signed that morning by the governor. Jimmy took it in a tired kind of way. He had served nearly ten months of a four year sentence. He had expected to stay only about three months, at the longest. When a man with as many friends on the outside as Jimmy Valentine had is received in the \"stir\" it is hardly worth while to cut his hair.\\n\\n\"Now, Valentine,\" said the warden, \"you\\'ll go out in the morning. Brace up, and make a man of yourself. You\\'re not a bad fellow at heart. Stop cracking safes, and live straight.\"\\n\\n\"Me?\" said Jimmy, in surprise. \"Why, I never cracked a safe in my life.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no,\" laughed the warden. \"Of course not. Let\\'s see, now. How was it you happened to get sent up on that Springfield job? Was it because you wouldn\\'t prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high-toned society? Or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you? It\\'s always one or the other with you innocent victims.\"\\n\\n\"Me?\" said Jimmy, still blankly virtuous. \"Why, warden, I never was in Springfield in my life!\"\\n\\n\"Take him back, Cronin!\" said the warden, \"and fix him up with outgoing clothes. Unlock him at seven in the morning, and let him come to the bull-pen. Better think over my advice, Valentine.\"\\n\\nAt a quarter past seven on the next morning Jimmy stood in the warden\\'s outer office. He had on a suit of the villainously fitting, ready-made clothes and a pair of the stiff, squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests.\\n\\nThe clerk handed him a railroad ticket and the five-dollar bill with which the law expected him to rehabilitate himself into good citizenship and prosperity. The warden gave him a cigar, and shook hands. Valentine, 9762, was chronicled on the books, \"Pardoned by Governor,\" and Mr. James Valentine walked out into the sunshine.\\n\\nDisregarding the song of the birds, the waving green trees, and the smell of the flowers, Jimmy headed straight for a restaurant. There he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine—followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him. From there he proceeded leisurely to the depot. He tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door, and boarded his train. Three hours set him down in a little town near the state line. He went to the café of one Mike Dolan and shook hands with Mike, who was alone behind the bar.\\n\\n\"Sorry we couldn\\'t make it sooner, Jimmy, me boy,\" said Mike. \"But we had that protest from Springfield to buck against, and the governor nearly balked. Feeling all right?\"\\n\\n\"Fine,\" said Jimmy. \"Got my key?\"\\n\\nHe got his key and went upstairs, unlocking the door of a room at the rear. Everything was just as he had left it. There on the floor was still Ben Price\\'s collar-button that had been torn from that eminent detective\\'s shirt-band when they had overpowered Jimmy to arrest him.\\n\\nPulling out from the wall a folding-bed, Jimmy slid back a panel in the wall and dragged out a dust-covered suit-case. He opened this and gazed fondly at the finest set of burglar\\'s tools in the East. It was a complete set, made of specially tempered steel, the latest designs in drills, punches, braces and bits, jimmies, clamps, and augers, with two or three novelties, invented by Jimmy himself, in which he took pride. Over nine hundred dollars they had cost him to have made at ----, a place where they make such things for the profession.\\n\\nIn half an hour Jimmy went down stairs and through the café. He was now dressed in tasteful and well-fitting clothes, and carried his dusted and cleaned suit-case in his hand.\\n\\n\"Got anything on?\" asked Mike Dolan, genially.\\n\\n\"Me?\" said Jimmy, in a puzzled tone. \"I don\\'t understand. I\\'m representing the New York Amalgamated Short Snap Biscuit Cracker and Frazzled Wheat Company.\"\\n\\nThis statement delighted Mike to such an extent that Jimmy had to take a seltzer-and-milk on the spot. He never touched \"hard\" drinks.\\n\\nA week after the release of Valentine, 9762, there was a neat job of safe-burglary done in Richmond, Indiana, with no clue to the author. A scant eight hundred dollars was all that was secured. Two weeks after that a patented, improved, burglar-proof safe in Logansport was opened like a cheese to the tune of fifteen hundred dollars, currency; securities and silver untouched. That began to interest the rogue-catchers. Then an old-fashioned bank-safe in Jefferson City became active and threw out of its crater an eruption of bank-notes amounting to five thousand dollars. The losses were now high enough to bring the matter up into Ben Price\\'s class of work. By comparing notes, a remarkable similarity in the methods of the burglaries was noticed. Ben Price investigated the scenes of the robberies, and was heard to remark:\\n\\n\"That\\'s Dandy Jim Valentine\\'s autograph. He\\'s resumed business. Look at that combination knob—jerked out as easy as pulling up a radish in wet weather. He\\'s got the only clamps that can do it. And look how clean those tumblers were punched out! Jimmy never has to drill but one hole. Yes, I guess I want Mr. Valentine. He\\'ll do his bit next time without any short-time or clemency foolishness.\"\\n\\nBen Price knew Jimmy\\'s habits. He had learned them while working up the Springfield case. Long jumps, quick get-aways, no confederates, and a taste for good society—these ways had helped Mr. Valentine to become noted as a successful dodger of retribution. It was given out that Ben Price had taken up the trail of the elusive cracksman, and other people with burglar-proof safes felt more at ease.\\n\\nOne afternoon Jimmy Valentine and his suit-case climbed out of the mail-hack in Elmore, a little town five miles off the railroad down in the black-jack country of Arkansas. Jimmy, looking like an athletic young senior just home from college, went down the board side-walk toward the hotel.\\n\\nA young lady crossed the street, passed him at the corner and entered a door over which was the sign, \"The Elmore Bank.\" Jimmy Valentine looked into her eyes, forgot what he was, and became another man. She lowered her eyes and coloured slightly. Young men of Jimmy\\'s style and looks were scarce in Elmore.\\n\\nJimmy collared a boy that was loafing on the steps of the bank as if he were one of the stockholders, and began to ask him questions about the town, feeding him dimes at intervals. By and by the young lady came out, looking royally unconscious of the young man with the suit-case, and went her way.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t that young lady Polly Simpson?\" asked Jimmy, with specious guile.\\n\\n\"Naw,\" said the boy. \"She\\'s Annabel Adams. Her pa owns this bank. What\\'d you come to Elmore for? Is that a gold watch-chain? I\\'m going to get a bulldog. Got any more dimes?\"\\n\\nJimmy went to the Planters\\' Hotel, registered as Ralph D. Spencer, and engaged a room. He leaned on the desk and declared his platform to the clerk. He said he had come to Elmore to look for a location to go into business. How was the shoe business, now, in the town? He had thought of the shoe business. Was there an opening?\\n\\nThe clerk was impressed by the clothes and manner of Jimmy. He, himself, was something of a pattern of fashion to the thinly gilded youth of Elmore, but he now perceived his shortcomings. While trying to figure out Jimmy\\'s manner of tying his four-in-hand he cordially gave information.\\n\\nYes, there ought to be a good opening in the shoe line. There wasn\\'t an exclusive shoe-store in the place. The dry-goods and general stores handled them. Business in all lines was fairly good. Hoped Mr. Spencer would decide to locate in Elmore. He would find it a pleasant town to live in, and the people very sociable.\\n\\nMr. Spencer thought he would stop over in the town a few days and look over the situation. No, the clerk needn\\'t call the boy. He would carry up his suit-case, himself; it was rather heavy.\\n\\nMr. Ralph Spencer, the phœnix that arose from Jimmy Valentine\\'s ashes—ashes left by the flame of a sudden and alterative attack of love—remained in Elmore, and prospered. He opened a shoe-store and secured a good run of trade.\\n\\nSocially he was also a success, and made many friends. And he accomplished the wish of his heart. He met Miss Annabel Adams, and became more and more captivated by her charms.\\n\\nAt the end of a year the situation of Mr. Ralph Spencer was this: he had won the respect of the community, his shoe-store was flourishing, and he and Annabel were engaged to be married in two weeks. Mr. Adams, the typical, plodding, country banker, approved of Spencer. Annabel\\'s pride in him almost equalled her affection. He was as much at home in the family of Mr. Adams and that of Annabel\\'s married sister as if he were already a member.\\n\\nOne day Jimmy sat down in his room and wrote this letter, which he mailed to the safe address of one of his old friends in St. Louis:\\n \\n\\n        Dear Old Pal:\\n\\n        I want you to be at Sullivan\\'s place, in Little Rock, next Wednesday night, at nine o\\'clock. I want you to wind up some little matters for me. And, also, I want to make you a present of my kit of tools. I know you\\'ll be glad to get them—you couldn\\'t duplicate the lot for a thousand dollars. Say, Billy, I\\'ve quit the old business—a year ago. I\\'ve got a nice store. I\\'m making an honest living, and I\\'m going to marry the finest girl on earth two weeks from now. It\\'s the only life, Billy—the straight one. I wouldn\\'t touch a dollar of another man\\'s money now for a million. After I get married I\\'m going to sell out and go West, where there won\\'t be so much danger of having old scores brought up against me. I tell you, Billy, she\\'s an angel. She believes in me; and I wouldn\\'t do another crooked thing for the whole world. Be sure to be at Sully\\'s, for I must see you. I\\'ll bring along the tools with me.\\n\\n        Your old friend,\\n\\n        Jimmy.\\n         \\n\\nOn the Monday night after Jimmy wrote this letter, Ben Price jogged unobtrusively into Elmore in a livery buggy. He lounged about town in his quiet way until he found out what he wanted to know. From the drug-store across the street from Spencer\\'s shoe-store he got a good look at Ralph D. Spencer.\\n\\n\"Going to marry the banker\\'s daughter are you, Jimmy?\" said Ben to himself, softly. \"Well, I don\\'t know!\"\\n\\nThe next morning Jimmy took breakfast at the Adamses. He was going to Little Rock that day to order his wedding-suit and buy something nice for Annabel. That would be the first time he had left town since he came to Elmore. It had been more than a year now since those last professional \"jobs,\" and he thought he could safely venture out.\\n\\nAfter breakfast quite a family party went downtown together—Mr. Adams, Annabel, Jimmy, and Annabel\\'s married sister with her two little girls, aged five and nine. They came by the hotel where Jimmy still boarded, and he ran up to his room and brought along his suit-case. Then they went on to the bank. There stood Jimmy\\'s horse and buggy and Dolph Gibson, who was going to drive him over to the railroad station.\\n\\nAll went inside the high, carved oak railings into the banking-room—Jimmy included, for Mr. Adams\\'s future son-in-law was welcome anywhere. The clerks were pleased to be greeted by the good-looking, agreeable young man who was going to marry Miss Annabel. Jimmy set his suit-case down. Annabel, whose heart was bubbling with happiness and lively youth, put on Jimmy\\'s hat, and picked up the suit-case. \"Wouldn\\'t I make a nice drummer?\" said Annabel. \"My! Ralph, how heavy it is? Feels like it was full of gold bricks.\"\\n\\n\"Lot of nickel-plated shoe-horns in there,\" said Jimmy, coolly, \"that I\\'m going to return. Thought I\\'d save express charges by taking them up. I\\'m getting awfully economical.\"\\n\\nThe Elmore Bank had just put in a new safe and vault. Mr. Adams was very proud of it, and insisted on an inspection by every one. The vault was a small one, but it had a new, patented door. It fastened with three solid steel bolts thrown simultaneously with a single handle, and had a time-lock. Mr. Adams beamingly explained its workings to Mr. Spencer, who showed a courteous but not too intelligent interest. The two children, May and Agatha, were delighted by the shining metal and funny clock and knobs.\\n\\nWhile they were thus engaged Ben Price sauntered in and leaned on his elbow, looking casually inside between the railings. He told the teller that he didn\\'t want anything; he was just waiting for a man he knew.\\n\\nSuddenly there was a scream or two from the women, and a commotion. Unperceived by the elders, May, the nine-year-old girl, in a spirit of play, had shut Agatha in the vault. She had then shot the bolts and turned the knob of the combination as she had seen Mr. Adams do.\\n\\nThe old banker sprang to the handle and tugged at it for a moment. \"The door can\\'t be opened,\" he groaned. \"The clock hasn\\'t been wound nor the combination set.\"\\n\\nAgatha\\'s mother screamed again, hysterically.\\n\\n\"Hush!\" said Mr. Adams, raising his trembling hand. \"All be quite for a moment. Agatha!\" he called as loudly as he could. \"Listen to me.\" During the following silence they could just hear the faint sound of the child wildly shrieking in the dark vault in a panic of terror.\\n\\n\"My precious darling!\" wailed the mother. \"She will die of fright! Open the door! Oh, break it open! Can\\'t you men do something?\"\\n\\n\"There isn\\'t a man nearer than Little Rock who can open that door,\" said Mr. Adams, in a shaky voice. \"My God! Spencer, what shall we do? That child—she can\\'t stand it long in there. There isn\\'t enough air, and, besides, she\\'ll go into convulsions from fright.\"\\n\\nAgatha\\'s mother, frantic now, beat the door of the vault with her hands. Somebody wildly suggested dynamite. Annabel turned to Jimmy, her large eyes full of anguish, but not yet despairing. To a woman nothing seems quite impossible to the powers of the man she worships.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you do something, Ralph — try, won\\'t you?\"\\n\\nHe looked at her with a queer, soft smile on his lips and in his keen eyes.\\n\\n\"Annabel,\" he said, \"give me that rose you are wearing, will you?\"\\n\\nHardly believing that she heard him aright, she unpinned the bud from the bosom of her dress, and placed it in his hand. Jimmy stuffed it into his vest-pocket, threw off his coat and pulled up his shirt-sleeves. With that act Ralph D. Spencer passed away and Jimmy Valentine took his place.\\n\\n\"Get away from the door, all of you,\" he commanded, shortly.\\n\\nHe set his suit-case on the table, and opened it out flat. From that time on he seemed to be unconscious of the presence of any one else. He laid out the shining, queer implements swiftly and orderly, whistling softly to himself as he always did when at work. In a deep silence and immovable, the others watched him as if under a spell.\\n\\nIn a minute Jimmy\\'s pet drill was biting smoothly into the steel door. In ten minutes—breaking his own burglarious record—he threw back the bolts and opened the door.\\n\\nAgatha, almost collapsed, but safe, was gathered into her mother\\'s arms.\\n\\nJimmy Valentine put on his coat, and walked outside the railings towards the front door. As he went he thought he heard a far-away voice that he once knew call \"Ralph!\" But he never hesitated.\\n\\nAt the door a big man stood somewhat in his way.\\n\\n\"Hello, Ben!\" said Jimmy, still with his strange smile. \"Got around at last, have you? Well, let\\'s go. I don\\'t know that it makes much difference, now.\"\\n\\nAnd then Ben Price acted rather strangely.\\n\\n\"Guess you\\'re mistaken, Mr. Spencer,\" he said. \"Don\\'t believe I recognize you. Your buggy\\'s waiting for you, ain\\'t it?\"\\n\\nAnd Ben Price turned and strolled down the street.', ['t06452', 't08905', 't08393', 't20214', 't06175', 't16447', 't02187', 't22938', 't03097', 't00265'])\n",

      "('One time two clowns set themselves to arguing. The people\\nwould stop, amused, to watch them.\\n— What’s that? they asked.\\n— Why, it’s only two clowns arguing.\\nWho could take them seriously? Ridiculous, the two comedians rep-\\narteed. The arguments were common nonsense, the theme was a ninnery.\\nAnd an entire day passed.\\nThe following morning, the two remained, obnoxious and outdoing\\neach other. It seemed as though, between them, even yucca soured. In the\\nstreet, meanwhile, those present were exhilarated with the masquerade.\\nThe buffoons began worsening their insults with fine-edged and fine-\\ntuned barbs. Believing it to be a show, the passersby left coins along the\\nroadside.\\nOn the third day, however, the clowns arrived at acts of force. Their\\nblows became a disarray, their counterkicks zinged more across air than\\nacross bodies. The children rollicked, imitating each jester’s blows. And\\nthey laughed at the two fools, their bodies tripping upon their own selves.\\nAnd the boys wanted to repay the delightful goodness of the clowns.\\n— Dad, give me some coins to leave on the sidewalk.\\nOn the fourth day, the jabs and blows grew worse. Beneath their\\nmakeup, the faces of the clowns began to bleed. Some kids became\\nscared. Was that true blood?\\n— It’s not serious, don’t fret, their parents soothed them.\\nIn failures of trajectory, some were struck by directionless wallops. But\\nit was light fare, only serving to add to the laughs. More and more people\\njoined the gallery.\\n— What’s going on?\\nNothing. A friendly unsettling of accounts. It’s not worth separating\\nthem. They’ll tire out, it’s nothing more than a bit of clowning around.\\nOn the fifth day, however, one of the clowns armed himself with a\\nstick. Advancing on his adversary, he discharged a blow that tore off his\\nwig. The other, furious, equipped himself with a symmetrical beating\\nbat and responded with the same dismeasure. The wooden rods whistled\\nthrough the air in somersaults and deliriums. One of the spectators, un-\\nexpectedly, was struck. The man fell, deadspread.\\nA certain confusion arose, the souls divided. Little by little, two battle-\\nfields began to form. Various groups traded drubbings. Still more were\\nfelled.\\nIt entered a second week and the surrounding neighborhoods heard\\nit said that a dizzied pandemonium had set in around the two clowns.\\nAnd the thing embroiled the entire plaza. And the neighbors found it\\nfunny. Some went to the plaza to verify the reports. They returned with\\ncontradicting and inflamed versions of their own. The neighborhood\\ncontinued to divide itself, in opposing opinions. Conflicts began in some\\nneighborhoods.\\nOn the twentieth day, shots began to be heard. No one knew exactly\\nwhere they came from. Could have been from any point in the city.\\nFull of terror, the inhabitants armed themselves. The tiniest movement\\nseemed suspect. The shots spread. Dead bodies began to accumulate in\\nthe streets. Terror reigned over the whole city. Soon, massacres began.\\nAt the beginning of the month, all the city’s inhabitants had died. All\\nexcept the two clowns. That morning, the comics sat, each one in his\\ncorner, and ridded themselves of their ridiculous dress. They looked at\\neach other, worn out. Later, they rose to their feet and embraced, laugh-\\ning at the flags dispersed. Arm in arm, they gathered the coins from the\\nroadsides.Together they crossed the city destroyed, careful not to tread on\\nthe cadavers. And they went in search of another city.', ['t08393', 't18297', 't15274', 't26668', 't02839', 't03644', 't08299', 't24933', 't07200', 't20214'])\n"

      "('Nobody knew what to do at first. Deposit slips fluttered to the floor. A man touched the rim of his baseball cap to make sure it was still there.\\n\\nThe bank robber seemed just as shocked. There were too many people. He realized that, despite all his preparation, he hadn’t considered the afternoon rush.\\n\\n“Put your hands up,” he said, and people more or less did that. “You’re all hostages now.”\\n\\n“We don’t want to be hostages,” someone said.\\n\\n“That’s not how this works,” the bank robber said. “I come in, you all become hostages, I get some money and leave, and then you’re free again.”\\n\\n“We’re afraid,” someone else said.\\n\\nThe bank robber got it—he was also afraid.\\n\\nA bank teller waved her hand, which was still raised above her head. “I’ll be the hostage,” she said.\\n\\n“You are already one of many hostages,” the bank robber said.\\n\\n“Then everyone can go and sit in the old vault,” she said. “There’s no way to call for help in there, and it has a heavy iron door. That means fewer people to mess things up. And I can access everything up front.”\\n\\nIt was a good plan and made the bank robber feel less like he had screwed up by coming in during the rush. “You’re sure there are no alert switches or emergency phones in there?”\\n\\n“It’s a hundred years old,” she said. “You couldn’t get a call out of there if you tried.”\\n\\nThe hostages all turned to see what he would say. He shifted his gun from one hand to the other.\\n\\n“Fine,” he said.\\n\\nThey all went to the old vault and the hostages filed in silently. There was plenty of room for them to sit or stand; they would be comfortable there. The teller turned an iron wheel to lock them in. “All right,” she said. “Let’s get to work.”\\n\\nShe opened every teller station using keys on a ring she kept at her waist. He watched her stack the money in a duffelbag, one of two he had brought for the purpose. He was grateful for her knowledge and assistance, if a little unsettled that she was offering it all so freely.\\n\\n“You’re not putting a dye pack in there, are you?” he asked.\\n\\nThe woman turned to look at him, and he was surprised to see that his question seemed to have wounded her. “I would never,” she said. “What would make you say that?”\\n\\n“I’m sorry.” He tried to think about what would make him say it; he had seen a dye pack in a movie once and knew that it could explode and make a terrible mess. There was a lot that he didn’t know about robbing banks, and every moment was another opportunity to reveal his ignorance.\\n\\nShe seemed to sense his hesitation and plucked a pen from one of the teller stations, rolling it across the counter toward him. “Why don’t you go sit down over there and draft a taunting letter to the police,” she said. She pointed to the mortgage officers’ desks, which ringed the lobby.\\n\\nHe pulled back the leather chair behind one of the desks and sat. It felt funny to be behind a desk, dressed as he was in black fatigues. The bank robber couldn’t remember the last time he’d sat behind any desk, and he’d certainly never been near one this nice. He stared at the empty page. Writing had never interested him in school; though he knew he had something to say, it gave him an uneasy feeling. He put his gun in the outgoing-mail tray and dumped a box of paper clips onto the desk.\\n\\nThe woman noticed him stringing paper clips together. “You could start with, ‘Fuck you, pigs, dumb motherfuckers,’ ” she said. “Or, if you want it to be more personal, you could try, like, ‘I’m the motherfucking heist king and you know it.’ It depends on the tone you want.”\\n\\n“Motherfucking heist king,” he repeated, writing it down.\\n\\n“You’re welcome.”\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, a little annoyed. “Thank you.”\\n\\nHe printed “Motherfucking Heist King” at the top of the page, then wrote it again and again, trying out different handwriting styles and lining the paper with a chain-link pattern. “Motherfucking Heist King”—it really was a nice phrase. Maybe if he could make a design with it, they would get the point of what he was trying to say. What was he trying to say, anyway? He realized that he hadn’t actually considered writing a letter until it was suggested to him.\\n\\nAfter a while, the teller came out from behind the counter to get his other bag. She looked over his shoulder at the page, which by then was covered in designs of his own creation. “Want me to write it?” she asked.\\n\\nHe handed her the paper and stood, surprised to find himself so irritated at someone who seemed only to want to help him. Walking to one of the high windows, he saw that a few police cars had begun to gather. “Maybe I should go,” he said.\\n\\nShe went back behind the counter with a pointed sigh and started to fill the second bag. He watched her poking around the cabinets. Outside, the police were setting up a barricade.\\n\\n“I’m going as fast as I can,” the teller said. She sounded angry. “I have to write your stupid letter and pack up this cash and get everything organized. I’m only one person.”\\n\\n“I didn’t say anything.”\\n\\n“This obviously isn’t about me,” she said. “I’ve seen this a million times before. You come in here for a little quick cash, you want to make a getaway. Am I wrong?”\\n\\n“You’re the bitch who volunteered.”\\n\\n“Wow,” she said. “I guess I must have said something to deserve that.”\\n\\nShe sounded exactly like his mother, which the bank robber realized was just typical.\\n\\n“Maybe you should go and get in the vault now,” he said. “You’ve helped me out. I appreciate you. I can take it from here.”\\n\\n“Yeah, right,” she said. “You think I’d let you finish this alone? I’ve done too much for you already to just walk away. I’m in it for the long haul.” She threw the last stacks of cash into the duffel so hard that it slid off the counter, sending its contents spilling across the floor.\\n\\nHe turned back to the window. If he just stayed out of her way, it would be over soon enough.\\n\\nGrumbling, she crouched down to clean it all up. At the very least, she figured, he could have helped when the bag fell. Thinking of others clearly wasn’t in his nature. She was actually getting pretty tired of his attitude: his inability to speak up, his dismal lack of self-confidence, his unwillingness to take a stand with either the hostages or the police. He didn’t have a point of view or an exit strategy, was content to remain in limbo. It was pathetic, really.\\n\\nWhen he approached the counter, the blank look on his face sickened her; it was the look of a man completely unable to understand the future or to confront it.\\n\\n“What?” he asked.\\n\\nShe slid the bag across the counter and spread her arms wide, levelling upon him the full power of her scorn. “You might as well just fucking shoot me,” she said.', ['t02187', 't06175', 't08393', 't28820', 't17855', 't26723', 't20226', 't18456', 't02282', 't01284'])\n",

      "('Nobody knew what to do at first. Deposit slips fluttered to the floor. A man touched the rim of his baseball cap to make sure it was still there.\\n\\nThe bank robber seemed just as shocked. There were too many people. He realized that, despite all his preparation, he hadn’t considered the afternoon rush.\\n\\n“Put your hands up,” he said, and people more or less did that. “You’re all hostages now.”\\n\\n“We don’t want to be hostages,” someone said.\\n\\n“That’s not how this works,” the bank robber said. “I come in, you all become hostages, I get some money and leave, and then you’re free again.”\\n\\n“We’re afraid,” someone else said.\\n\\nThe bank robber got it—he was also afraid.\\n\\nA bank teller waved her hand, which was still raised above her head. “I’ll be the hostage,” she said.\\n\\n“You are already one of many hostages,” the bank robber said.\\n\\n“Then everyone can go and sit in the old vault,” she said. “There’s no way to call for help in there, and it has a heavy iron door. That means fewer people to mess things up. And I can access everything up front.”\\n\\nIt was a good plan and made the bank robber feel less like he had screwed up by coming in during the rush. “You’re sure there are no alert switches or emergency phones in there?”\\n\\n“It’s a hundred years old,” she said. “You couldn’t get a call out of there if you tried.”\\n\\nThe hostages all turned to see what he would say. He shifted his gun from one hand to the other.\\n\\n“Fine,” he said.\\n\\nThey all went to the old vault and the hostages filed in silently. There was plenty of room for them to sit or stand; they would be comfortable there. The teller turned an iron wheel to lock them in. “All right,” she said. “Let’s get to work.”\\n\\nShe opened every teller station using keys on a ring she kept at her waist. He watched her stack the money in a duffelbag, one of two he had brought for the purpose. He was grateful for her knowledge and assistance, if a little unsettled that she was offering it all so freely.\\n\\n“You’re not putting a dye pack in there, are you?” he asked.\\n\\nThe woman turned to look at him, and he was surprised to see that his question seemed to have wounded her. “I would never,” she said. “What would make you say that?”\\n\\n“I’m sorry.” He tried to think about what would make him say it; he had seen a dye pack in a movie once and knew that it could explode and make a terrible mess. There was a lot that he didn’t know about robbing banks, and every moment was another opportunity to reveal his ignorance.\\n\\nShe seemed to sense his hesitation and plucked a pen from one of the teller stations, rolling it across the counter toward him. “Why don’t you go sit down over there and draft a taunting letter to the police,” she said. She pointed to the mortgage officers’ desks, which ringed the lobby.\\n\\nHe pulled back the leather chair behind one of the desks and sat. It felt funny to be behind a desk, dressed as he was in black fatigues. The bank robber couldn’t remember the last time he’d sat behind any desk, and he’d certainly never been near one this nice. He stared at the empty page. Writing had never interested him in school; though he knew he had something to say, it gave him an uneasy feeling. He put his gun in the outgoing-mail tray and dumped a box of paper clips onto the desk.\\n\\nThe woman noticed him stringing paper clips together. “You could start with, ‘Fuck you, pigs, dumb motherfuckers,’ ” she said. “Or, if you want it to be more personal, you could try, like, ‘I’m the motherfucking heist king and you know it.’ It depends on the tone you want.”\\n\\n“Motherfucking heist king,” he repeated, writing it down.\\n\\n“You’re welcome.”\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, a little annoyed. “Thank you.”\\n\\nHe printed “Motherfucking Heist King” at the top of the page, then wrote it again and again, trying out different handwriting styles and lining the paper with a chain-link pattern. “Motherfucking Heist King”—it really was a nice phrase. Maybe if he could make a design with it, they would get the point of what he was trying to say. What was he trying to say, anyway? He realized that he hadn’t actually considered writing a letter until it was suggested to him.\\n\\nAfter a while, the teller came out from behind the counter to get his other bag. She looked over his shoulder at the page, which by then was covered in designs of his own creation. “Want me to write it?” she asked.\\n\\nHe handed her the paper and stood, surprised to find himself so irritated at someone who seemed only to want to help him. Walking to one of the high windows, he saw that a few police cars had begun to gather. “Maybe I should go,” he said.\\n\\nShe went back behind the counter with a pointed sigh and started to fill the second bag. He watched her poking around the cabinets. Outside, the police were setting up a barricade.\\n\\n“I’m going as fast as I can,” the teller said. She sounded angry. “I have to write your stupid letter and pack up this cash and get everything organized. I’m only one person.”\\n\\n“I didn’t say anything.”\\n\\n“This obviously isn’t about me,” she said. “I’ve seen this a million times before. You come in here for a little quick cash, you want to make a getaway. Am I wrong?”\\n\\n“You’re the bitch who volunteered.”\\n\\n“Wow,” she said. “I guess I must have said something to deserve that.”\\n\\nShe sounded exactly like his mother, which the bank robber realized was just typical.\\n\\n“Maybe you should go and get in the vault now,” he said. “You’ve helped me out. I appreciate you. I can take it from here.”\\n\\n“Yeah, right,” she said. “You think I’d let you finish this alone? I’ve done too much for you already to just walk away. I’m in it for the long haul.” She threw the last stacks of cash into the duffel so hard that it slid off the counter, sending its contents spilling across the floor.\\n\\nHe turned back to the window. If he just stayed out of her way, it would be over soon enough.\\n\\nGrumbling, she crouched down to clean it all up. At the very least, she figured, he could have helped when the bag fell. Thinking of others clearly wasn’t in his nature. She was actually getting pretty tired of his attitude: his inability to speak up, his dismal lack of self-confidence, his unwillingness to take a stand with either the hostages or the police. He didn’t have a point of view or an exit strategy, was content to remain in limbo. It was pathetic, really.\\n\\nWhen he approached the counter, the blank look on his face sickened her; it was the look of a man completely unable to understand the future or to confront it.\\n\\n“What?” he asked.\\n\\nShe slid the bag across the counter and spread her arms wide, levelling upon him the full power of her scorn. “You might as well just fucking shoot me,” she said.', ['t02187', 't06175', 't08393', 't28820', 't17855', 't26723', 't20226', 't18456', 't02282', 't01284'])\n",

      "('Nobody knew what to do at first. Deposit slips fluttered to the floor. A man touched the rim of his baseball cap to make sure it was still there.\\n\\nThe bank robber seemed just as shocked. There were too many people. He realized that, despite all his preparation, he hadn’t considered the afternoon rush.\\n\\n“Put your hands up,” he said, and people more or less did that. “You’re all hostages now.”\\n\\n“We don’t want to be hostages,” someone said.\\n\\n“That’s not how this works,” the bank robber said. “I come in, you all become hostages, I get some money and leave, and then you’re free again.”\\n\\n“We’re afraid,” someone else said.\\n\\nThe bank robber got it—he was also afraid.\\n\\nA bank teller waved her hand, which was still raised above her head. “I’ll be the hostage,” she said.\\n\\n“You are already one of many hostages,” the bank robber said.\\n\\n“Then everyone can go and sit in the old vault,” she said. “There’s no way to call for help in there, and it has a heavy iron door. That means fewer people to mess things up. And I can access everything up front.”\\n\\nIt was a good plan and made the bank robber feel less like he had screwed up by coming in during the rush. “You’re sure there are no alert switches or emergency phones in there?”\\n\\n“It’s a hundred years old,” she said. “You couldn’t get a call out of there if you tried.”\\n\\nThe hostages all turned to see what he would say. He shifted his gun from one hand to the other.\\n\\n“Fine,” he said.\\n\\nThey all went to the old vault and the hostages filed in silently. There was plenty of room for them to sit or stand; they would be comfortable there. The teller turned an iron wheel to lock them in. “All right,” she said. “Let’s get to work.”\\n\\nShe opened every teller station using keys on a ring she kept at her waist. He watched her stack the money in a duffelbag, one of two he had brought for the purpose. He was grateful for her knowledge and assistance, if a little unsettled that she was offering it all so freely.\\n\\n“You’re not putting a dye pack in there, are you?” he asked.\\n\\nThe woman turned to look at him, and he was surprised to see that his question seemed to have wounded her. “I would never,” she said. “What would make you say that?”\\n\\n“I’m sorry.” He tried to think about what would make him say it; he had seen a dye pack in a movie once and knew that it could explode and make a terrible mess. There was a lot that he didn’t know about robbing banks, and every moment was another opportunity to reveal his ignorance.\\n\\nShe seemed to sense his hesitation and plucked a pen from one of the teller stations, rolling it across the counter toward him. “Why don’t you go sit down over there and draft a taunting letter to the police,” she said. She pointed to the mortgage officers’ desks, which ringed the lobby.\\n\\nHe pulled back the leather chair behind one of the desks and sat. It felt funny to be behind a desk, dressed as he was in black fatigues. The bank robber couldn’t remember the last time he’d sat behind any desk, and he’d certainly never been near one this nice. He stared at the empty page. Writing had never interested him in school; though he knew he had something to say, it gave him an uneasy feeling. He put his gun in the outgoing-mail tray and dumped a box of paper clips onto the desk.\\n\\nThe woman noticed him stringing paper clips together. “You could start with, ‘Fuck you, pigs, dumb motherfuckers,’ ” she said. “Or, if you want it to be more personal, you could try, like, ‘I’m the motherfucking heist king and you know it.’ It depends on the tone you want.”\\n\\n“Motherfucking heist king,” he repeated, writing it down.\\n\\n“You’re welcome.”\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, a little annoyed. “Thank you.”\\n\\nHe printed “Motherfucking Heist King” at the top of the page, then wrote it again and again, trying out different handwriting styles and lining the paper with a chain-link pattern. “Motherfucking Heist King”—it really was a nice phrase. Maybe if he could make a design with it, they would get the point of what he was trying to say. What was he trying to say, anyway? He realized that he hadn’t actually considered writing a letter until it was suggested to him.\\n\\nAfter a while, the teller came out from behind the counter to get his other bag. She looked over his shoulder at the page, which by then was covered in designs of his own creation. “Want me to write it?” she asked.\\n\\nHe handed her the paper and stood, surprised to find himself so irritated at someone who seemed only to want to help him. Walking to one of the high windows, he saw that a few police cars had begun to gather. “Maybe I should go,” he said.\\n\\nShe went back behind the counter with a pointed sigh and started to fill the second bag. He watched her poking around the cabinets. Outside, the police were setting up a barricade.\\n\\n“I’m going as fast as I can,” the teller said. She sounded angry. “I have to write your stupid letter and pack up this cash and get everything organized. I’m only one person.”\\n\\n“I didn’t say anything.”\\n\\n“This obviously isn’t about me,” she said. “I’ve seen this a million times before. You come in here for a little quick cash, you want to make a getaway. Am I wrong?”\\n\\n“You’re the bitch who volunteered.”\\n\\n“Wow,” she said. “I guess I must have said something to deserve that.”\\n\\nShe sounded exactly like his mother, which the bank robber realized was just typical.\\n\\n“Maybe you should go and get in the vault now,” he said. “You’ve helped me out. I appreciate you. I can take it from here.”\\n\\n“Yeah, right,” she said. “You think I’d let you finish this alone? I’ve done too much for you already to just walk away. I’m in it for the long haul.” She threw the last stacks of cash into the duffel so hard that it slid off the counter, sending its contents spilling across the floor.\\n\\nHe turned back to the window. If he just stayed out of her way, it would be over soon enough.\\n\\nGrumbling, she crouched down to clean it all up. At the very least, she figured, he could have helped when the bag fell. Thinking of others clearly wasn’t in his nature. She was actually getting pretty tired of his attitude: his inability to speak up, his dismal lack of self-confidence, his unwillingness to take a stand with either the hostages or the police. He didn’t have a point of view or an exit strategy, was content to remain in limbo. It was pathetic, really.\\n\\nWhen he approached the counter, the blank look on his face sickened her; it was the look of a man completely unable to understand the future or to confront it.\\n\\n“What?” he asked.\\n\\nShe slid the bag across the counter and spread her arms wide, levelling upon him the full power of her scorn. “You might as well just fucking shoot me,” she said.', ['t02187', 't06175', 't08393', 't28820', 't17855', 't26723', 't20226', 't18456', 't02282', 't01284'])\n",

He put his gun in the outgoing-mail tray and dumped a box of paper clips onto the desk.\\n\\nThe woman noticed him stringing paper clips together. “You could start with, ‘Fuck you, pigs, dumb motherfuckers,’ ” she said. “Or, if you want it to be more personal, you could try, like, ‘I’m the motherfucking heist king and you know it.’ It depends on the tone you want.”\\n\\n“Motherfucking heist king,” he repeated, writing it down.\\n\\n“You’re welcome.”\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, a little annoyed. “Thank you.”\\n\\nHe printed “Motherfucking Heist King” at the top of the page, then wrote it again and again, trying out different handwriting styles and lining the paper with a chain-link pattern. “Motherfucking Heist King”—it really was a nice phrase. Maybe if he could make a design with it, they would get the point of what he was trying to say. What was he trying to say, anyway? He realized that he hadn’t actually considered writing a letter until it was suggested to him.\\n\\nAfter a while, the teller came out from behind the counter to get his other bag. She looked over his shoulder at the page, which by then was covered in designs of his own creation. “Want me to write it?” she asked.\\n\\nHe handed her the paper and stood, surprised to find himself so irritated at someone who seemed only to want to help him. Walking to one of the high windows, he saw that a few police cars had begun to gather. “Maybe I should go,” he said.\\n\\nShe went back behind the counter with a pointed sigh and started to fill the second bag. He watched her poking around the cabinets. Outside, the police were setting up a barricade.\\n\\n“I’m going as fast as I can,” the teller said. She sounded angry. “I have to write your stupid letter and pack up this cash and get everything organized. I’m only one person.”\\n\\n“I didn’t say anything.”\\n\\n“This obviously isn’t about me,” she said. “I’ve seen this a million times before. You come in here for a little quick cash, you want to make a getaway. Am I wrong?”\\n\\n“You’re the bitch who volunteered.”\\n\\n“Wow,” she said. “I guess I must have said something to deserve that.”\\n\\nShe sounded exactly like his mother, which the bank robber realized was just typical.\\n\\n“Maybe you should go and get in the vault now,” he said. “You’ve helped me out. I appreciate you. I can take it from here.”\\n\\n“Yeah, right,” she said. “You think I’d let you finish this alone? I’ve done too much for you already to just walk away. I’m in it for the long haul.” She threw the last stacks of cash into the duffel so hard that it slid off the counter, sending its contents spilling across the floor.\\n\\nHe turned back to the window. If he just stayed out of her way, it would be over soon enough.\\n\\nGrumbling, she crouched down to clean it all up. At the very least, she figured, he could have helped when the bag fell. Thinking of others clearly wasn’t in his nature. She was actually getting pretty tired of his attitude: his inability to speak up, his dismal lack of self-confidence, his unwillingness to take a stand with either the hostages or the police. He didn’t have a point of view or an exit strategy, was content to remain in limbo. It was pathetic, really.\\n\\nWhen he approached the counter, the blank look on his face sickened her; it was the look of a man completely unable to understand the future or to confront it.\\n\\n“What?” he asked.\\n\\nShe slid the bag across the counter and spread her arms wide, levelling upon him the full power of her scorn. “You might as well just fucking shoot me,” she said.', ['t02187', 't06175', 't08393', 't28820', 't17855', 't26723', 't20226', 't18456', 't02282', 't01284'])\n"

There were too many people. He realized that, despite all his preparation, he hadn’t considered the afternoon rush.\\n\\n“Put your hands up,” he said, and people more or less did that. “You’re all hostages now.”\\n\\n“We don’t want to be hostages,” someone said.\\n\\n“That’s not how this works,” the bank robber said. “I come in, you all become hostages, I get some money and leave, and then you’re free again.”\\n\\n“We’re afraid,” someone else said.\\n\\nThe bank robber got it—he was also afraid.\\n\\nA bank teller waved her hand, which was still raised above her head. “I’ll be the hostage,” she said.\\n\\n“You are already one of many hostages,” the bank robber said.\\n\\n“Then everyone can go and sit in the old vault,” she said. “There’s no way to call for help in there, and it has a heavy iron door. That means fewer people to mess things up. And I can access everything up front.”\\n\\nIt was a good plan and made the bank robber feel less like he had screwed up by coming in during the rush. “You’re sure there are no alert switches or emergency phones in there?”\\n\\n“It’s a hundred years old,” she said. “You couldn’t get a call out of there if you tried.”\\n\\nThe hostages all turned to see what he would say. He shifted his gun from one hand to the other.\\n\\n“Fine,” he said.\\n\\nThey all went to the old vault and the hostages filed in silently. There was plenty of room for them to sit or stand; they would be comfortable there. The teller turned an iron wheel to lock them in. “All right,” she said. “Let’s get to work.”\\n\\nShe opened every teller station using keys on a ring she kept at her waist. He watched her stack the money in a duffelbag, one of two he had brought for the purpose. He was grateful for her knowledge and assistance, if a little unsettled that she was offering it all so freely.\\n\\n“You’re not putting a dye pack in there, are you?” he asked.\\n\\nThe woman turned to look at him, and he was surprised to see that his question seemed to have wounded her. “I would never,” she said. “What would make you say that?”\\n\\n“I’m sorry.” He tried to think about what would make him say it; he had seen a dye pack in a movie once and knew that it could explode and make a terrible mess. There was a lot that he didn’t know about robbing banks, and every moment was another opportunity to reveal his ignorance.\\n\\nShe seemed to sense his hesitation and plucked a pen from one of the teller stations, rolling it across the counter toward him. “Why don’t you go sit down over there and draft a taunting letter to the police,” she said. She pointed to the mortgage officers’ desks, which ringed the lobby.\\n\\nHe pulled back the leather chair behind one of the desks and sat. It felt funny to be behind a desk, dressed as he was in black fatigues. The bank robber couldn’t remember the last time he’d sat behind any desk, and he’d certainly never been near one this nice. He stared at the empty page. Writing had never interested him in school; though he knew he had something to say, it gave him an uneasy feeling. He put his gun in the outgoing-mail tray and dumped a box of paper clips onto the desk.\\n\\nThe woman noticed him stringing paper clips together. “You could start with, ‘Fuck you, pigs, dumb motherfuckers,’ ” she said. “Or, if you want it to be more personal, you could try, like, ‘I’m the motherfucking heist king and you know it.’ It depends on the tone you want.”\\n\\n“Motherfucking heist king,” he repeated, writing it down.\\n\\n“You’re welcome.”\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, a little annoyed. “Thank you.”\\n\\nHe printed “Motherfucking Heist King” at the top of the page, then wrote it again and again, trying out different handwriting styles and lining the paper with a chain-link pattern. “Motherfucking Heist King”—it really was a nice phrase. Maybe if he could make a design with it, they would get the point of what he was trying to say. What was he trying to say, anyway? He realized that he hadn’t actually considered writing a letter until it was suggested to him.\\n\\nAfter a while, the teller came out from behind the counter to get his other bag. She looked over his shoulder at the page, which by then was covered in designs of his own creation. “Want me to write it?” she asked.\\n\\nHe handed her the paper and stood, surprised to find himself so irritated at someone who seemed only to want to help him. Walking to one of the high windows, he saw that a few police cars had begun to gather. “Maybe I should go,” he said.\\n\\nShe went back behind the counter with a pointed sigh and started to fill the second bag. He watched her poking around the cabinets. Outside, the police were setting up a barricade.\\n\\n“I’m going as fast as I can,” the teller said. She sounded angry. “I have to write your stupid letter and pack up this cash and get everything organized. I’m only one person.”\\n\\n“I didn’t say anything.”\\n\\n“This obviously isn’t about me,” she said. “I’ve seen this a million times before. You come in here for a little quick cash, you want to make a getaway. Am I wrong?”\\n\\n“You’re the bitch who volunteered.”\\n\\n“Wow,” she said. “I guess I must have said something to deserve that.”\\n\\nShe sounded exactly like his mother, which the bank robber realized was just typical.\\n\\n“Maybe you should go and get in the vault now,” he said. “You’ve helped me out. I appreciate you. I can take it from here.”\\n\\n“Yeah, right,” she said. “You think I’d let you finish this alone? I’ve done too much for you already to just walk away. I’m in it for the long haul.” She threw the last stacks of cash into the duffel so hard that it slid off the counter, sending its contents spilling across the floor.\\n\\nHe turned back to the window. If he just stayed out of her way, it would be over soon enough.\\n\\nGrumbling, she crouched down to clean it all up. At the very least, she figured, he could have helped when the bag fell. Thinking of others clearly wasn’t in his nature. She was actually getting pretty tired of his attitude: his inability to speak up, his dismal lack of self-confidence, his unwillingness to take a stand with either the hostages or the police. He didn’t have a point of view or an exit strategy, was content to remain in limbo. It was pathetic, really.\\n\\nWhen he approached the counter, the blank look on his face sickened her; it was the look of a man completely unable to understand the future or to confront it.\\n\\n“What?” he asked.\\n\\nShe slid the bag across the counter and spread her arms wide, levelling upon him the full power of her scorn. “You might as well just fucking shoot me,” she said.', ['t02187', 't06175', 't08393', 't28820', 't17855', 't26723', 't20226', 't18456', 't02282', 't01284'])\n",

For example, the reader knows that the bank robber is not prepared for the afternoon rush, but the robber himself does not seem to realize this until it is too late. Additionally, the reader knows that the teller is offering to help the robber, but the robber is unaware of her motives and is instead focused on his own confusion and frustration. The use of dramatic irony creates tension and adds depth to the story, as it allows the reader to understand the characters' situations and motivations in a way that the characters themselves do not.\n",
