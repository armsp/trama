       "'Somebody thought they were protected by the power of narrative convention. Then reality ensued.\\nBy definition, fiction is unrealistic. But most of those who indulge in media don\\'t ask for their stories to be completely like reality. As long as things are kept internally consistent, an audience is willing to go along with just about anything an author can create... no matter how irresponsible, immoral, or unhinged their more likeable and sympathetic characters might be acting by the standards of Real Life. For that reason, a creator can sometimes ignore or Hand Wave consequences of the real world in their stories. This trope, though, is about what happens when a creator chooses not to ignore said consequences, and even factors them in as part of the plot or events.\\nThis can sometimes be seen on the hard end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism, though it isn\\'t necessarily so since realism, despite what many claim, is not the same as cynicism. There are many realistic stories that run on optimism.\\nGenerally, this trope is not used in order to make fiction completely and entirely mirror mundane everyday life... except when it is. This is also surprisingly often used as a Comedy Trope. Contrast Fantasy All Along, when reality ensues and immediately afterwards fantasy kicks in again (occasionally undoing the damage done by the \"reality\" moment).\\nNote that, when we say \"reality\", we mean reality as in Real Life. We have \"X happens\" and \"Y happens as a consequence of X\"; the Y must not involve the fantastic in-story aspects of the work\\'s own universe. For realistic consequences of unrealistic superpowers, see Logical Weakness.\\nThe Extraordinary World, Ordinary Problems trope is a variant. Also related to Deconstruction and Deconstructive Parody, and is mainly used for comedy.note\\xa0The difference between this trope and Deconstruction is the outcome, oddly enough - where deconstruction goes for a logical and realistic outcome under the rules employed (say \"magic exists\" + \"some people are crazy/evil\" = \"fireball-throwing maniacs using magic to commit crime\"), as mentioned this trope goes for a logical and realistic outcome under Real Life rules, i.e. \"magic does not exist\" and people believing it does are just weirdoes.\\nNot to be confused with Hilarity Ensues, although when done right, the two can and will overlap. Still, do note that this is not strictly a \"humor\" trope: the defiance of a fantastic element can be a pretty powerful tool for deconstructive drama and sometimes even horror.\\nCharacters who use this to their advantage almost invariably are Genre Savvy. A Wrong Genre Savvy character has chances to be hit hard by an Ensuing Reality. The No-Nonsense Nemesis runs entirely on this trope played for drama and sometimes horror. Violates No Ontological Inertia when things do not automatically change because one thing comes to an end.\\nSince this trope is entirely about outcomes happening under the rules of Real Life, real life examples would be redundant. If you want more detailed information on this, see Television Is Trying to Kill Us, a detailed list of why many different fiction tropes would not only not work out well in real life, but will end in disaster for anyone who actually attempts to do it.\\nWarning: As this trope frequently occurs at the climax of a work, spoilers are likely to be unmarked. Caution advised.'"

      "Driven by necessity, I accepted a position as a substitute Latin teacher at the National School of Buenos Aires, an élite preparatory school. I’d never thought that I would teach high-school Latin, although I was equipped to do so. As for the substitution: they didn’t explain if the teacher I was stepping in for was sick or had died or been fired; his absence sounded more like a time-out. It was not only time that seemed frozen; the school did, too. Something had sucked the air out of that place: at school functions, students did not breathe, and the teachers’ lounge featured enormous portraits of illustrious rectors, plus a gigantic one of a major naval battle. The teachers’ lounge was dark, as were the courtyards, and in those places I would sense disapproving looks aimed in my direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was surely a modern methodology for teaching Latin, but that place prevented me from making any plans. I would go in terrified and feel calm again only once I was at least two blocks away. I felt that everything I did was wrong; my fear was a kind of animal fear, and I was just relieved that they didn’t beat me or lock me inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "The school has always been a nest for fledgling leaders, dissidents, and success stories, but, at thirteen and fourteen years old, those kids were punished for any little thing; a security guard, who was said to work for the police, did not allow them to go to the bathroom during classroom hours, no exceptions. Those were the conditions I had to work in, and teaching Latin no less. The sentences my students translated went like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "    The slave prepares a dinner of roasted eel for the lady.\n",
      "    The dog must be obedient to his owner, the child to his parents.\n",
      "    Young lady, put on the light-blue toga to honor our goddess.\n",
      "    Caesar advances forty-five parasangs with his Army.\n",
      "\n",
      "How far is a “parasang”? Whom could I ask?\n",
      "\n",
      "    Young lady, you must put flowers on the goddess’s altar and cinnabar on Janus’.\n",
      "\n",
      "What might “cinnabar” be? The students were going to fuck with me by asking, but neither I nor they actually wanted to know. Having made a fool of myself, I would leave the school still not knowing such things, and if, as I expected, some punishment were to be inflicted upon me, at least I would know the reason. The texts used such restrictive and cruel language; it was always an order, a demand, an altar for some goddess. But the passage I hated most was the one by Arria, the matron who, with great conviction, told her sick husband in one room that their son, who had died in another, was getting better and had eaten a hearty meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I taught Latin class from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M., I would lighten the mood by teaching Roman culture in the second hour and describing what the Romans ate.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I always found odd about Roman cuisine was that one creature was cooked inside another. For example, you might find a goose inside a pig, and, inside the goose, a little chicken, all of this smeared in honey, the glue that kept it together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would say to my students, “How interesting!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And they would reply, “Disgusting! Why are you telling us this—and right at noon!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I also taught them that, in ancient Rome, people would toss everything in the streets—piss and all the rest. The lesson generated such an uproar that I wasn’t able to contain it. I was saved by the bell, but the security guard who was with the police still came in and stared at me. I fled to a café that was about five blocks away and not on my regular route; I wandered around like a lost puppy. When I sat down, the café seemed extraordinary to me, the street like a sanctuary, and the waiter a prince.\n",

      "I answered that I’d been visited by three ghosts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it three?\n",
      "\n",
      "The first ghost showed up in the form of a Bernese mountain dog. It was like this. I was staying at a cabin with my husband’s family over the Christmas break. This large dog, maybe two hundred and fifty pounds, came to the back door. He didn’t bark—he looked in through the glass pane and waited patiently. My father-in-law, who, as a child, had shared a home with a deer and a flying squirrel, opened the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "That giant mountain dog came up the steps, crossed the room, and greeted me with a gentle head push. He put his nose down between his front paws, to make himself lower than me. He wagged his tail, gently. He had chosen me. He visited every day that week, for an hour or two in the morning, an hour or two in the afternoon, following me all around the house and out into the yard, too. I get along with dogs fine, generally, but this was something else. We loved each other. His nametag read “Kush.” To the rest of the family, he was merely polite. I don’t know how to explain it, but my father’s spirit was in that dog. Yes, my father had also been giant, and gentle, but it was more than that. My father was paying me a visit. It was strange, but also obvious. This was some fifteen years ago. In the year or so after the encounter, it seemed like I was meeting Bernese mountain dogs in elevators and on sidewalks all the time, but, when I met Kush, who was also my father, he was the first Bernese mountain dog I’d ever seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where were all those dogs now? The breed had surged in popularity, then, it seemed, vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "I met the next ghost at a book-club meeting at the Boulder Public Library. I didn’t live in Boulder, I was passing through, but there was a notice in the newspaper about the book club, and my husband and I thought it sounded fun. I was a better person when I was young, and more open. The book club was reading “The Overcoat,” by Nikolai Gogol. Poor Akaky Akakievich spends all his savings on a new overcoat; the coat is stolen; after a series of further humiliations, trying to reclaim the coat, he dies of a fever; there are reports of his ghost haunting St. Petersburg, stealing coats from others.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a mixed crowd at the book club. Was the story about bureaucracy? About human vanity? About folklore? Was it a satire, or a tragedy, etc. It was the usual discussion. But then a small, thin man sitting in the corner scolded us all for missing the point. “Ghosts are real,” he said. The story was about a real ghost and “none of you understand that.” The thin man said that he knew that ghosts were real because for years he had worked at a slaughterhouse in Broomfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man’s comments were received politely, but he left the meeting frustrated. Upon reflection, it was clear, to me and my husband, that the man from Broomfield was himself a ghost. That was what he was trying to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last ghost was a mom I knew only a little bit, from my youth. Her husband was a professional trumpeter. I babysat for her two boys a few times. The last time I did so, they were so out of control when their parents came home that I was never asked back again—which I thought was reasonable. Later, two very sad things happened in that family: one of the boys died in a car accident, and the mom had a seizure in the night and was found to have a brain tumor. By that time, I lived in a city thousands of miles away and hadn’t seen the family in years. But one night, more than a year after I learned of the tumor, I had a very vivid dream with Leona in it—Leona was the mom’s name—and we said hello and were very happy to see each other. Really happy. The next day my own mom called me to tell me that Leona had died. I’d never had a dream with Leona in it before, and I never had another one after.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told my daughter about the ghosts, because I wanted to be honest with her. Ghosts aren’t real, but also they are? Or something like that. I don’t know what I wanted to communicate to her. Probably I was showing off. I said three ghosts. But wasn’t that misleading? I had spent so many years interested in ghosts, the dead, ancestors I’d never met, anything sad and gone—that world felt real to me. But I haven’t seen a single ghost in more than ten years. Wait, no, I fixed the math. I hadn’t seen one in . . . the number of years was the age of my daughter. Now I spend my time more fully among the living. Either that, or the ghost these days is me.\n",
