    "# count tokens per story\n",
    "story = \"\"\"Every year Thanksgiving night we flocked out behind Dad as he dragged the Santa suit to the road and draped it over a kind of crucifix he'd built out of metal pole in the yard. Super Bowl week the pole was dressed in a jersey and Rod's helmet and Rod had to clear it with Dad if he wanted to take the helmet off. On the Fourth of July the pole was Uncle Sam, on Veteran’s Day a soldier,  on Halloween a ghost. The pole was Dad's only concession to glee. We were allowed a single Crayola from the box at a time. One Christmas Eve he shrieked at Kimmie for wasting an apple slice. He hovered over us as we poured ketchup saying: good enough good enough good enough. Birthday parties consisted of cupcakes, no ice cream. The first time I brought a date over she said: what's with your dad and that pole? and I sat there blinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "We left home, married,  had children of our own, found the seeds of meanness blooming also within us. Dad began dressing the pole with more complexity and less discernible logic. He draped some kind of fur over it on Groundhog Day and lugged out a floodlight to ensure a shadow. When an earthquake struck Chile he lay the pole on its side and spray painted a rift in the earth. Mom died and he dressed the pole as Death and hung from the crossbar photos of Mom as a baby. We'd stop by and find odd talismans from his youth arranged around the base: army medals, theater tickets, old sweatshirts, tubes of Mom's makeup. One autumn he painted the pole bright yellow. He covered it with cotton swabs that winter for warmth and provided offspring by hammering in six crossed sticks around the yard. He ran lengths of string between the pole and the sticks, and taped to the string letters of apology, admissions of error, pleas for understanding, all written in a frantic hand on index cards. He painted a sign saying LOVE and hung it from the pole and another that said FORGIVE? and then he died in the hall with the radio on and we sold the house to a young couple who yanked out the pole and the sticks and left them by the road on garbage day.\"\"\""

A joke, probably: time is money. Or, maybe, money is time; it depends on what you\\u2019re short of. The Boss is a great joker.

She pauses under it and looks around, clearly thinking about something. She\\u2019s no beauty, but she has sweet ways. His hard heart softens. He takes his hand off the revolver.\\n\\nWhen she turns to walk down the alley again, the gunman flicks his cigarette away and walks with her, moving as she moves. Left, right, left . . . it\\u2019s a kind of dance. She asks if he\\u2019s making fun of her. He says he doesn\\u2019t know how to make fun. In truth, he feels caught up in something fundamental. Benumbing. A feeling he hasn\\u2019t had before. Abstract, yet oddly erotic.\\n\\nIt won\\u2019t do any good, she says, reading him.\\n\\nYeah, I know, lady.

Never mind. Worry about them when they do.\\n\\nWhen their dance ends, night has fully descended, sharpening the contrast between the pool of lamplight they have stepped into and the rest of the world, lost in the darkness beyond. That was great, he says. She looks up at him, her face pale but radiant in the light. She nods. Her sad smile seems to say, Yes, but it\\u2019s not enough, is it? She stares down at her feet, and when she does so, her face is masked in shadow. Is she about to betray him? he wonders. Does he care?\\n\\nShe starts suddenly, glances back down the alley. He follows her gaze. Uh-oh. Something is moving. His hand, too slowly, is inside his jacket. Watch out! she cries, and throws herself in front of him. A shot rings out. She collapses into his arms. Holding her, he fires impotently into the darkness. His bullets ricochet through the alley like ironic laughter. Hang on, baby! he pleads, but it\\u2019s too late.\\n\\nIt must be . . . why . . . she whispers, and dies in his arms.\\n\\nHis heart hardens again. Rage bites at the corners of his eyes.

It was just a dumb notion. One of Tommy\\u2019s uncles had been a nemesis of his when he was a kid.

The three were due to start the evening weekend shift at the Oasis water-cooler factory in an hour. Ernie and Tommy were machine operators. Luke was on the assembly line, sticking the warning stickers on the interior frames of the coolers as they rolled by him at a rate of one every three seconds. Luke was a qualified electrician, but had shown up to work insufficiently sober one too many times, botched the wiring in one house too many\\u2014and then had to take whatever he could get. Most people stuck the gruelling monotony of the assembly line for only a few months: they either got promoted elsewhere or quit. Luke had been on the line for eighteen months straight. As far as Tommy was concerned, it had turned the lad insane. Tommy and Ernie\\u2019s job was also boring, but in a more involved way. Every few weeks, there was some adjustment or recalibration to the cutting equipment that needed to be implemented, plus they were in charge of a team of four lifters\\u2014teen-agers, mostly, who pulled the still-hot casings out of the molds.

There was a weird atmosphere in the plant that weekend, rumors spreading on the floor with a sour excitability, conjecture traded and revised at every canteen break. By Monday morning, the employees had put the pieces of a picture together. The consensus was that the bald man was an American, an emissary from the central office over in Massachusetts or Minnesota, Milwaukee or Manitoba, or wherever the hell the central office was, and that he was here to inform them the factory was going to go. On Monday afternoon, management sent out an e-mail advising of an exciting, company-wide root and branch realignment of resources, which would allow for a dramatic expansion in the company\\u2019s productivity and scale but that, also, somehow, involved cutting the human staff in the Irish plant by sixty per cent.\\n\\n\\u201cActually, the factory is fine.

For the rest of the year, the hotel was vacant. One summer, when I was eleven, I broke into the hotel bar by cracking open its window\\u2014it took me an hour\\u2014and stole a bottle of blueberry juice. A guy who was a bartender there in the winter, but idled in the summer, caught me and blackmailed me, asking for money not to tell my parents. I told him to fuck off. He told my parents. They punished me, but that blueberry juice was the sweetest of potions. The hotel\\u2019s cleaning staff was a woman of undetermined body shape and age, named Baja, who spent summer days sitting on the hotel balcony, looking at nothing, always wearing a blue overcoat and a black scarf on her head, one of its corners covering her jaw to keep it warm. She was, like a ghost, impervious to pain. She had an eternal toothache that she would not treat, the abscess swelling until it had devoured and destroyed one of her eyes. Nobody ever saw her clean anything, though a friend of mine who\\u2019d stayed at the hotel told me that Baja had once walked into his room without knocking, looked around, and said, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you clean this up? It\\u2019s disgusting.\\u201d Right behind the hotel, there was a crested boulder, which my sister and I would climb when there was nothing else to do. From the top, we could see the weekend-house cluster below and hear the buzzing of circular saws, the banging of hammers, the din of aspiration, for the weekenders were perpetually getting ready for some future in which active life would be successfully completed and there\\u2019d be nothing but peace, virginal nature, and retirement. The war would put an end to that ambition, but back then, when we were kids, the future was always on its way, its advance currents flowing through everything we knew or wanted to know. If we looked away from the house cluster, wooded vales and peaks, meadows and roads stretched toward Sarajevo and beyond, onward to the horizon, into which, at the end of the day, the sun would slide like a coin into a slot.

It was Olav who mentioned the place to me, at the start of our relationship. He told me that it\\u2019d been the summer cottage of the Norwegian author Knut Terje Aasbakken. Now it served as a writer\\u2019s retreat, and a narrow lane led up to it from the village Olav was from. As a child, he\\u2019d spy on the writers. They seemed so secretive, he said, and dived into me.\\n\\nAfter our relationship began to get complicated, a friend suggested I go away somewhere. So it was that I remembered Aasbakken\\u2019s cabin. The one on a mountainside, in a forest.\\n\\nI applied, got the cabin, and left at the beginning of September. A woman from the general store drove me from the village. She talked about the area as we crept up the mountain in her little Golf. On the way, we passed the community center. She said it was customary for whoever was in the cabin to give a reading in the center. I gazed down on the river in the valley, and then she dropped me off with a key to the woodshed.\\n\\nEvenings, I\\u2019d take a chair out in front of the cabin and try to stay there till I was shaking from the cold. In the mornings, I read, wrote zip. Late in the day I\\u2019d take a walk. And then one day I found myself at a standstill in front of the community-center notice board. \\u201cBUNADS,\\u201d the heading read, and under it was the name of Olav\\u2019s mother. She was called Halldis and taught the locals to sew their own folk costumes.\\n\\nThe days lasted an eternity, and at night the cold moved in. I walked around Aasbakken\\u2019s house and picked paint from the cabinet doors. Out in the forest, the mushrooms poked up, and it was impossible to escape the reading event in the community center. One evening in October, I positioned myself against a large loom-woven tapestry. During the coffee break, a woman with short dark hair and a face like an Inuit\\u2019s came over. She said, \\u201cI think you\\u2019ve met my son. He lives in Copenhagen.\\u201d I must have stared. \\u201cI\\u2019ve got an article he\\u2019s written about you,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nIn that way, I became sort of friends with Olav\\u2019s mother, Halldis. We agreed to go on some walks together. Later we also went out riding on her Fjord horses. She talked about the landscape, the kinds of tracks animals left, and how the winter we were entering would feel. We never spoke of Olav. It was my impression that she was a strong person, but at regular intervals she\\u2019d worry about whether I\\u2019d write about her.\\n\\nOne day in early November, we took the horses into the forest. When we came to a clearing, I said that the vista would make for a good opening scene. She said, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m so afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nI thought of Olav, his face and hers, and that might\\u2019ve been the day she invited me home for coffee. In any case, I remember that we let the horses loose in the pasture and sat in the kitchen. There were pictures of Olav and his wife on the bulletin board, and I\\u2019m sure that I gave Halldis a hug when I left.\\n\\nDespite the awkwardness in our relationship, we kept seeing each other. One day when we were in the kitchen, Olav\\u2019s father came in. He sat down at the table reluctantly, as we probably didn\\u2019t want to be disturbed. Halldis found him a coffee cup, and of course he was disturbing us. I recall him saying that he didn\\u2019t care for well-educated people. He was a carpenter, Olav\\u2019s father. Said that the hand\\u2019s labor was important and pointed to the table. I praised the table, and then I had to go and see his workshop.\\n\\nWe walked out to it, all three, and what I remember most clearly was that he\\u2019d stuck up a photo of a naked woman with a thumbtack. He\\u2019d pinned her up over the door to the room where Halldis worked on her costumes. That meant that Halldis had to walk under the naked woman anytime she went in and did her sewing. You never know about other people\\u2019s relationships, but I thought to myself that it was their marriage Halldis didn\\u2019t want me to write about. It seemed complicated to me, though I think it seemed healthy to her.\\n\\nEvery day she passed beneath the naked woman who hung over the door with her legs slightly spread, and she\\u2019d hung there so long that Halldis no longer noticed her. She was no doubt thinking of her son in Copenhagen. His wife was beautiful and industrious. He interviewed famous authors. And now one of them was living in Aasbakken\\u2019s cabin.\\n\\nThe cabin had no phone, so I ended up getting a letter. I have it still. He was angry, Olav. \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t have thought it of you,\\u201d he wrote.\\n\\nIn that sense, he wasn\\u2019t like his mother. I can recall another time we rode out together. It was a clear fall morning. On the outward part of our route, we rode past a lake. To me, Norwegian lakes feel bottomless, the landscape unknowable. Such uncertainty must leave its mark on the locals, I thought. Later, we went in among the trees, where it smelled of fungus and rot.\\n\\nAs we rode, we talked about how the forest looked lovely in its decay. I told her she resembled an Inuit, and that Olav must have got his features from her. She smiled at that, and there were birds of prey aloft, and moss upon the massive trunks of spruce, and I drank in everything I saw.\\n\\nThen one day, when we were drinking coffee in the kitchen and her husband came in, wanting attention, she actually began to tell a story. She looked at Olav\\u2019s father, asked him, \\u201cDo I dare to tell this?\\u201d and he said, \\u201cYes, just tell it.\\u201d\\n\\nAt first I thought she asked him whether she should tell the story because it was his, or because he decided which stories could be told in their relationship. In any case, she began telling it, though at times she\\u2019d put a hand over her mouth. \\u201cNo, I don\\u2019t know if I dare,\\u201d she said, glancing from her husband down into her cup.\\n\\nThe story concerned her cousin who had been married to a bad man.\\n\\nIt wasn\\u2019t until the man was dead that the cousin discovered just how bad he\\u2019d been. It came out from the estate and certain letters found with it. \\u201cBut you mustn\\u2019t write this story,\\u201d she said. She shouldn\\u2019t be worried, I said. \\u201cYour cousin\\u2019s husband wasn\\u2019t so out of the ordinary.\\u201d She asked, did I know such men? I said that now and then I ran into one. She asked if I wrote about them. \\u201cSometimes,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nI have the impression that during the time we spent together she managed to read my books. She mentioned one in particular. It had become winter, we were in the forest, and the surroundings creaked with snow and ice. She\\u2019d read the book but didn\\u2019t quite know what to think of it. She found the indecisiveness of the female protagonist especially hard to bear.\\n\\nWe crawled over an old stone wall. The sun was shining; my eyes hurt from all the whiteness. Recently, I saw an old photo from the gold-mining town of Yellowknife, near the Arctic Circle. It was a picture of an Inuit and then the sun, and the sun wasn\\u2019t alone. It had company. It\\u2019s an optical phenomenon\\u2014the sun\\u2019s light is refracted by ice crystals and two bright points appear, one on either side. Under the picture it said that the sun had been joined by its rivals, the ones that in the language of the prairie were called sun dogs.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat exactly are you afraid I\\u2019m going to write about?\\u201d I asked her. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nShe stood there and the light went right through her, that\\u2019s the way I remember it.\\n\\nHow the sun caused her physical form to cease.

Let\\u2019s say C., a translator, found an excellent way to solve his children\\u2019s problems. Or, rather, to get his children to solve their own problems. Anytime they started whining and trying to foist their issues on him, C. would say, pensively: \\u201cWhy should I, an adult human, pick up the Legos scattered all over the floor?\\u201d \\u201cWhy should I, an adult human, struggle to get a plum out from under the tub?\\u201d \\u201cWhy should I, an adult human, watch \\u2018Up\\u2019 for the fourth time?\\u201d (Actually, this was a separate problem, because translator C. actively fears \\u201cUp,\\u201d a film about death and loneliness\\u2014but why should he, an adult human, have to explain all that to some little pissants?) And so, in the couple of months since he enacted this strategy, his children, to translator C.\\u2019s delight, have not only stopped harassing him so much, but have actually evolved (in his opinion) into much more independent people. They stuff their Legos into the bag of rice all by themselves; whatever\\u2019s rolled under the tub stays there, smelling great; they stream \\u201cUp\\u201d all by themselves and non-consensually tell Daddy all about it by themselves, too. So translator C. starts recommending his system to everyone he knows. Then, one day, he walks into the bathroom, and there\\u2019s his seven-year-old son P., lying in the empty tub with his eyes closed, mumbling: \\u201cWhy should I, an adult human, have to think about any of this? Well, why should I?\\u201d And translator C. starts to feel a little sick\\u2014but it\\u2019s too late now, isn\\u2019t it.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story begins with a teacher leading a discussion with a children's book club. He asks the children what they would do if they witnessed two kids beating up a third child. The children answer with suggestions such as telling a grownup or running for help. However, when the teacher asks what they would do if the child being beaten up is someone they don't like, one girl named Katya shocks everyone by stating that they should chase the bullies away and then finish off the disliked child themselves. When the teacher questions her about why she would do this, Katya explains that the disliked child is usually strong, but now she's probably tired herself out.\\n\\nMoving on, the story shifts to X., an engineer and father, who decides to make traditional Hanukkah doughnuts for his two-year-old child from scratch. Despite spending a long time in the kitchen preparing them, his child refuses to eat them and says she doesn't like them. X. becomes upset and questions why his child does not appreciate his effort. The next day, X. discovers his child happily eating store-bought doughnuts at her daycare. He recalls his own childhood experience of refusing to eat his mother's homemade dumplings but happily eating store-bought ones at other households.\\n\\nNext, a little boy tells his mother in the middle of a train station that he no longer wants to be the person she is raising him to be and instead wants to scream in the subway. This showcases the child's desire for self-expression and rebellion.\\n\\nIn another household, a poet named F. has an aged nanny who has been with the family for generations. The nanny has survived various historical events and always asks, \\\"So, did he get away?\\\" after hearing stories. This question leads to a discussion among guests about the significance of this question in relation to the Russian and Jewish people.\\n\\nLater, an anxious writer named G. becomes convinced that he has wronged his loved ones, leading him to call them multiple times a day to apologize for small things. Eventually, his loved ones send him a letter stating that they don't need a reason to hate him. This highlights G.'s paranoia and fear of not being loved.\\n\\nLastly, a translator named C. finds a way to solve his children's problems by refusing to do things for them, claiming that he, as an adult, should not have to pick up after them or do certain things. This strategy leads his children to become more independent and self-sufficient. However, C. begins to feel sick when he finds his son mimicking his words in an empty bathtub, making him question his own parenting approach.\\n\\nOverall, the story explores various aspects of human behavior, including violence, preference, rebellion, generational experiences, fear, and parenting techniques.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"In this collection of interconnected flash fiction stories, the author explores various scenarios and situations that highlight the complexity of human nature and relationships.\\n\\nIn the first story, a teacher engages with children discussing ethics and what they would do if they witness a bullying situation. One student surprises the teacher by proposing that the bullies should be stopped, yet amusingly adds that the person being bullied should then be finished off, showing the shades of human behavior.\\n\\nThe second story involves a father who goes through great effort to make homemade Hanukkah doughnuts for his daughter, only to be rejected with a simple \\\"I don't like it.\\\" However, the next day, the daughter enjoys store-bought doughnuts from a friend, revealing how individuals might have different preferences and the irony in the father's reaction.\\n\\nThe third story showcases a little boy in a crowded station whispering to his mother about his desire to let go and scream in the metro, hinting at the tensions underlying societal and personal expectations.\\n\\nThe fourth story revolves around a aged nanny who listens attentively to the family's stories throughout her life but each time asks, \\\"So, did he get away?\\\" sparking a debate among guests over whether the question symbolizes the Russian people or the Jewish people. Through her silence, the nanny represents the resilience of people living through challenging times.\\n\\nIn the fifth story, a paranoid writer ensures he asks forgiveness for every minor mistake he believes he makes, bombarding loved ones with calls until they send him a letter saying they don't need a reason to hate him. This paints a portrait of someone grappling with anxiety while trying to maintain relationships.\\n\\nThe final story features a translator named C. who ingeniously handles his children by refusing to solve problems for them. This alternative parenting strategy gets mixed results when the father finds his rule being taken to an extreme by his 9-year-old son, causing distress and potential regret.\\n\\nThese stories collectively explore themes of human psychology and relationship dynamics.

A red-haired woman came up afterward. He had seen her circling earlier, taking a chair at the back, but he had not troubled about it. \\u201cI knew you in the Congo,\\u201d she said now. \\u201cI knew your wife.\\u201d My wife? he thought, but, as always after a reading, in the retreating roar of his own soul he could barely hear her or remember how English worked. Had she said \\u201clife,\\u201d not \\u201cwife\\u201d? Her voice, that of a crow, thrust at him\\u2014some weekend they\\u2019d \\u201call spent together\\u201d and he\\u2019d sent her a letter the next day, a poem. Dread rose at the back of his mind; a parcel broke. He turned away, busied himself. He blamed, abhorred the touch of a past time; it surprised him how much. She followed him to the dinner that Charles (the London Librarian) had arranged at a nearby bistro, hurrying along behind everyone else, and, with the touch of his wife or his life burning like a toxin on his inside skin, Joseph Conrad could not meet her eyes or let pathos come clouding into him. When she seated herself at the foot of the table and was speaking loudly to anyone who listened, he felt the pluck of it on the side of his head but did not turn, he had to continue, now he\\u2019d begun, it was a long dinner. It was unjust. In other contexts, he admired perseverance. She was drowning. He did not turn. The light of pure reason, Joseph Conrad liked to say, resembles electricity in being cold. Proud statements like this came to him now and again when he was swimming but afterward seemed a bit off. No, it was a little nightmare, it was a rescue he could not carry out (and he was a rescuer).\\n\\nBut eventually the dinner ended. It was still 1907. No one had drowned. Shrugging into coats, they said hearty farewell things. He did not catch her eye. All left together to walk back toward the Library and go their ways. It was an early winter night. He began to feel fundamentally impatient with himself, hot with cowardice. He dropped back to walk beside her. His heartbeat was too fast. She did not seem surprised. An unknownness enveloped them, as if they were playing a game, as if they were draped in cloth or lost in old rooms. How they got to talking about white bread he could not remember afterward, but it shone in his mind, this conversation, as the bread had shone, and he was trying to tell her all that. Maybe she had mentioned lining up for bread in the early-morning dusk, sent out by her mother, running home with a loaf as heavy as two schoolbooks. When one dreamed of bread even now, Joseph Conrad agreed with her, it was not the rough black bread of childhood. Dream bread, mythic bread, was as white as a freshly laundered cuff.\\n\\nOnce, he had gone from London to visit his homeland and been invited to a christening in the countryside. It was June. On the drive, the weather closed in, matte gray and vague, typical summer weather for that region. The ceremony was as usual, in a tiny white church, where everyone sat packed like teeth and listened to short, glorious off-key songs sung by a ten-year-old girl, who was the sister of the new baby. The sun came out. Everyone rushed from the church. They stood amid graves, talking, amazed. Vast general fields reached away on every side to the mountains. He recalled the feeling of being a small mark at the center of a greenness so dazzlingly revealed it hurt the eyes. Soon, they embarked in cars and drove to a nearby farmhouse for lunch, sunlight still spilling over everything.\\n\\nThe farmhouse stood with all doors open, children tumbling in and out, busy conversation everywhere. He knew scarcely anyone, so stood in an inner room, mastering it in case he would one day write about it, near a table draped in a lace cloth and heavy with cakes. There was a cake as big as two schoolbooks\\u2014he smilingly used her analogy\\u2014emblazoned with the name of the new baby. A chocolate cake shaped like a bear and full of candies that erupted for the children. Many fluffy cream cakes and several tall block-like structures layered with red jam. There were also other smaller foods, shrimp on crackers and so forth, and, finally, carried in late with a sort of hasty deference, on its own blue-patterned china plate, a stack of sliced white bread.

Indy prompted the next question.\\n\\nIt came from a pretty woman in a clingy skirt. \\u201cHi, Dr. Jones,\\u201d she said, and, as she went on, he found himself recalling a student, a girl, from his teaching days. \\u201cYou mentioned that, at the Maharajah\\u2019s banquet, you were served a dessert of chilled monkey brains?\\u201d\\n\\nHe nodded, still thinking of the student who used to sit in the front row of his history class.

It\\u2019s a Manchurian dish.\\u201d\\n\\nIndy recalled the way his former student had closed and opened her eyes. Love you. Love you.

What he wouldn\\u2019t give to be back in the jungles of Honduras or jumping trains across Nazi-occupied Europe, where he could let his whip do the talking. He\\u2019d taken this gig for the honorarium, mainly.\\n\\nFor the final question, the moderator pointed to a tiny woman with billowing black hair. \\u201cMr. Jones,\\u201d she said, already annoying him, for he had a Ph.D. \\u201cHow would you respond to the claim that you\\u2019re more of a grave robber than an archeologist?

Quietly he said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never put anything in a museum.\\u201d\\n\\nHe looked at the floor. The general murmur was excruciating.\\n\\nEventually, he heard the gentle voice of the moderator: \\u201cIndiana . . .

The car was empty. He had nothing planned that day. Wherever he went and whatever he did (or didn\\u2019t do) was entirely up to him. It was ten o\\u2019clock on a windless summer morning, and the sun was beating down. The train passed Shinjuku, Yotsuya, Ochanomizu, and arrived at Tokyo Central Station, the end of the line. Everyone got off, and Tengo followed suit. Then he sat on a bench and gave some thought to where he should go. \\u201cI can go anywhere I decide to,\\u201d he told himself. \\u201cIt looks as if it\\u2019s going to be a hot day. I could go to the seashore.\\u201d He raised his head and studied the platform guide.\\n\\nAt that point, he realized what he had been doing all along.\\n\\nHe tried shaking his head a few times, but the idea that had struck him would not go away. He had probably made up his mind unconsciously the moment he boarded the Chuo Line train in Koenji. He heaved a sigh, stood up from the bench, and asked a station employee for the fastest connection to Chikura. The man flipped through the pages of a thick volume of train schedules. He should take the 11:30 special express train to Tateyama, the man said, and transfer there to a local; he would arrive at Chikura shortly after two o\\u2019clock. Tengo bought a Tokyo-Chikura round-trip ticket. Then he went to a restaurant in the station and ordered rice and curry and a salad.\\n\\nGoing to see his father was a depressing prospect. He had never much liked the man, and his father had no special love for him, either. He had retired four years earlier and, soon afterward, entered a sanatorium in Chikura that specialized in patients with cognitive disorders. Tengo had visited him there no more than twice\\u2014the first time just after he had entered the facility, when a procedural problem required Tengo, as the only relative, to be there. The second visit had also involved an administrative matter. Two times: that was it.\\n\\nThe sanatorium stood on a large plot of land by the coast. It was an odd combination of elegant old wooden buildings and new three-story reinforced-concrete buildings. The air was fresh, however, and, aside from the roar of the surf, it was always quiet. An imposing pine grove formed a windbreak along the edge of the garden. And the medical facilities were excellent. With his health insurance, retirement bonus, savings, and pension, Tengo\\u2019s father could probably spend the rest of his life there quite comfortably. He might not leave behind any sizable inheritance, but at least he would be taken care of, for which Tengo was tremendously grateful. Tengo had no intention of taking anything from him or giving anything to him. They were two separate human beings who had come from\\u2014and were heading toward\\u2014entirely different places. By chance, they had spent some years of life together\\u2014that was all. It was a shame that it had come to that, but there was absolutely nothing that Tengo could do about it.\\n\\nTengo paid his check and went to the platform to wait for the Tateyama train. His only fellow-passengers were happy-looking families heading out for a few days at the beach.\\n\\nMost people think of Sunday as a day of rest. Throughout his childhood, however, Tengo had never once viewed Sunday as a day to enjoy. For him, Sunday was like a misshapen moon that showed only its dark side. When the weekend came, his whole body began to feel sluggish and achy, and his appetite would disappear. He had even prayed for Sunday not to come, though his prayers were never answered.\\n\\nWhen Tengo was a boy, his father was a collector of subscription fees for NHK\\u2014Japan\\u2019s quasi-governmental radio and television network\\u2014and, every Sunday, he would take Tengo with him as he went door to door soliciting payment. Tengo had started going on these rounds before he entered kindergarten and continued through fifth grade without a single weekend off. He had no idea whether other NHK fee collectors worked on Sundays, but, for as long as he could remember, his father always had. If anything, his father worked with even more enthusiasm than usual, because on Sundays he could catch the people who were usually out during the week.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father had several reasons for taking him along on his rounds. One reason was that he could not leave the boy at home alone. On weekdays and Saturdays, Tengo could go to school or to day care, but these institutions were closed on Sundays. Another reason, Tengo\\u2019s father said, was that it was important for a father to show his son what kind of work he did. A child should learn early on what activity was supporting him, and he should appreciate the importance of labor. Tengo\\u2019s father had been sent out to work in the fields on his father\\u2019s farm, on Sunday like any other day, from the time he was old enough to understand anything. He had even been kept out of school during the busiest seasons. To him, such a life was a given.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father\\u2019s third and final reason was a more calculating one, which was why it had left the deepest scars on his son\\u2019s heart. Tengo\\u2019s father was well aware that having a small child with him made his job easier. Even people who were determined not to pay often ended up forking over the money when a little boy was staring up at them, which was why Tengo\\u2019s father saved his most difficult routes for Sunday. Tengo sensed from the beginning that this was the role he was expected to play, and he absolutely hated it. But he also felt that he had to perform it as cleverly as he could in order to please his father. If he pleased his father, he would be treated kindly that day. He might as well have been a trained monkey.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s one consolation was that his father\\u2019s beat was fairly far from home. They lived in a suburban residential district outside the city of Ichikawa, and his father\\u2019s rounds were in the center of the city. At least he was able to avoid doing collections at the homes of his classmates. Occasionally, though, while walking in the downtown shopping area, he would spot a classmate on the street. When this happened, he ducked behind his father to keep from being noticed.\\n\\nOn Monday mornings, his school friends would talk excitedly about where they had gone and what they had done the day before. They went to amusement parks and zoos and baseball games. In the summer, they went swimming, in the winter skiing. But Tengo had nothing to talk about. From morning to evening on Sundays, he and his father rang the doorbells of strangers\\u2019 houses, bowed their heads, and took money from whoever came to the door. If people didn\\u2019t want to pay, his father would threaten or cajole them. If they tried to talk their way out of paying, his father would raise his voice. Sometimes he would curse at them like stray dogs. Such experiences were not the sort of thing that Tengo could share with friends. He could not help feeling like a kind of alien in the society of middle-class children of white-collar workers. He lived a different kind of life in a different world. Luckily, his grades were outstanding, as was his athletic ability. So even though he was an alien he was never an outcast. In most circumstances, he was treated with respect. But whenever the other boys invited him to go somewhere or to visit their homes on a Sunday he had to turn them down. Soon, they stopped asking.\\n\\nBorn the third son of a farming family in the hardscrabble Tohoku region, Tengo\\u2019s father had left home as soon as he could, joining a homesteaders\\u2019 group and crossing over to Manchuria in the nineteen-thirties. He had not believed the government\\u2019s claims that Manchuria was a paradise where the land was vast and rich. He knew enough to realize that \\u201cparadise\\u201d was not to be found anywhere. He was simply poor and hungry. The best he could hope for if he stayed at home was a life on the brink of starvation. In Manchuria, he and the other homesteaders were given some farming implements and small arms, and together they started cultivating the land. The soil was poor and rocky, and in winter everything froze. Sometimes stray dogs were all they had to eat. Even so, with government support for the first few years they managed to get by. Their lives were finally becoming more stable when, in August, 1945, the Soviet Union launched a full-scale invasion of Manchuria. Tengo\\u2019s father had been expecting this to happen, having been secretly informed of the impending situation by a certain official, a man he had become friendly with. The minute he heard the news that the Soviets had violated the border, he mounted his horse, galloped to the local train station, and boarded the second-to-last train for Da-lien. He was the only one among his farming companions to make it back to Japan before the end of the year.\\n\\nAfter the war, Tengo\\u2019s father went to Tokyo and tried to make a living as a black marketeer and as a carpenter\\u2019s apprentice, but he could barely keep himself alive. He was working as a liquor-store deliveryman in Asakusa when he bumped into his old friend the official he had known in Manchuria. When the man learned that Tengo\\u2019s father was having a hard time finding a decent job, he offered to recommend him to a friend in the subscription department of NHK, and Tengo\\u2019s father gladly accepted. He knew almost nothing about NHK, but he was willing to try anything that promised a steady income.\\n\\nAt NHK, Tengo\\u2019s father carried out his duties with great gusto. His foremost strength was his perseverance in the face of adversity. To someone who had barely eaten a filling meal since birth, collecting NHK fees was not excruciating work. The most hostile curses hurled at him were nothing. Moreover, he felt satisfaction at belonging to an important organization, even as one of its lowest-ranking members. His performance and attitude were so outstanding that, after a year as a commissioned collector, he was taken directly into the ranks of the full-fledged employees, an almost unheard-of achievement at NHK. Soon, he was able to move into a corporation-owned apartment and join the company\\u2019s health-care plan. It was the greatest stroke of good fortune he had ever had in his life.\\n\\nYoung Tengo\\u2019s father never sang him lullabies, never read books to him at bedtime. Instead, he told the boy stories of his actual experiences. He was a good storyteller. His accounts of his childhood and youth were not exactly pregnant with meaning, but the details were lively. There were funny stories, moving stories, and violent stories. If a life can be measured by the color and variety of its episodes, Tengo\\u2019s father\\u2019s life had been rich in its own way, perhaps. But when his stories touched on the period after he became an NHK employee they suddenly lost all vitality. He had met a woman, married her, and had a child\\u2014Tengo. A few months after Tengo was born, his mother had fallen ill and died. His father had raised him alone after that, while working hard for NHK. The End. How he happened to meet Tengo\\u2019s mother and marry her, what kind of woman she was, what had caused her death, whether her death had been an easy one or she had suffered greatly\\u2014Tengo\\u2019s father told him almost nothing about such matters. If he tried asking, his father just evaded the questions. Most of the time, such questions put him in a foul mood. Not a single photograph of Tengo\\u2019s mother had survived.\\n\\nTengo fundamentally disbelieved his father\\u2019s story. He knew that his mother hadn\\u2019t died a few months after he was born. In his only memory of her, he was a year and a half old and she was standing by his crib in the arms of a man other than his father. His mother took off her blouse, dropped the straps of her slip, and let the man who was not his father suck on her breasts. Tengo slept beside them, his breathing audible. But, at the same time, he was not asleep. He was watching his mother.\\n\\nThis was Tengo\\u2019s photograph of his mother. The ten-second scene was burned into his brain with perfect clarity. It was the only concrete information he had about her, the one tenuous connection his mind could make with her. He and she were linked by this hypothetical umbilical cord. His father, however, had no idea that this vivid scene existed in Tengo\\u2019s memory, or that, like a cow in a meadow, Tengo was endlessly regurgitating fragments of it to chew on, a cud from which he obtained essential nutrients. Father and son: each was locked in a deep, dark embrace with his own secrets.\\n\\nAs an adult, Tengo often wondered if the young man sucking on his mother\\u2019s breasts in his vision was his biological father. This was because Tengo in no way resembled his father, the stellar NHK collections agent. Tengo was a tall, strapping man with a broad forehead, a narrow nose, and tightly balled ears. His father was short and squat and utterly unimpressive. He had a small forehead, a flat nose, and pointed ears like a horse\\u2019s. Where Tengo had a relaxed and generous look, his father appeared nervous and tightfisted. Comparing the two of them, people often openly remarked on their dissimilarity.\\n\\nStill, it was not their physical features that made it difficult for Tengo to identify with his father but their psychological makeup. His father showed no sign at all of what might be called intellectual curiosity. True, having been born in poverty he had not had a decent education. Tengo felt a degree of pity for his father\\u2019s circumstances. But a basic desire to obtain knowledge\\u2014which Tengo assumed to be a more or less natural urge in people\\u2014was lacking in the man. He had a certain practical wisdom that enabled him to survive, but Tengo could discern no hint of a willingness in his father to deepen himself, to view a wider, larger world. Tengo\\u2019s father never seemed to suffer discomfort from the stagnant air of his cramped little life. Tengo never once saw him pick up a book. He had no interest in music or movies, and he never took a trip. The only thing that seemed to interest him was his collection route. He would make a map of the area, mark it with colored pens, and examine it whenever he had a spare moment, the way a biologist might study chromosomes.\\n\\nTengo, by contrast, was curious about everything. He absorbed knowledge from a broad range of fields with the efficiency of a power shovel scooping earth. He had been regarded as a math prodigy from early childhood, and he could solve high-school math problems by the time he was in third grade. Math was, for young Tengo, an effective means of retreat from his life with his father. In the mathematical world, he would walk down a long corridor, opening one numbered door after another. Each time a new spectacle unfolded before him, the ugly traces of the real world would simply disappear. As long as he was actively exploring that realm of infinite consistency, he was free.\\n\\nWhile math was like a magnificent imaginary building for Tengo, literature was a vast magical forest. Math stretched infinitely upward toward the heavens, but stories spread out before him, their sturdy roots stretching deep into the earth. In this forest there were no maps, no doorways. As Tengo got older, the forest of story began to exert an even stronger pull on his heart than the world of math. Of course, reading novels was just another form of escape\\u2014as soon as he closed the book, he had to come back to the real world. But at some point he noticed that returning to reality from the world of a novel was not as devastating a blow as returning from the world of math. Why was that? After much thought, he reached a conclusion. No matter how clear things might become in the forest of story, there was never a clear-cut solution, as there was in math. The role of a story was, in the broadest terms, to transpose a problem into another form. Depending on the nature and the direction of the problem, a solution might be suggested in the narrative. Tengo would return to the real world with that suggestion in hand. It was like a piece of paper bearing the indecipherable text of a magic spell. It served no immediate practical purpose, but it contained a possibility.\\n\\nThe one possible solution that Tengo was able to decipher from his readings was this one: My real father must be somewhere else. Like an unfortunate child in a Dickens novel, Tengo had perhaps been led by strange circumstances to be raised by this impostor. Such a possibility was both a nightmare and a great hope. After reading \\u201cOliver Twist,\\u201d Tengo plowed through every Dickens volume in the library. As he travelled through Dickens\\u2019s stories, he steeped himself in reimagined versions of his own life. These fantasies grew ever longer and more complex. They followed a single pattern, but with infinite variations. In all of them, Tengo would tell himself that his father\\u2019s home was not where he belonged. He had been mistakenly locked in this cage, and someday his real parents would find him and rescue him. Then he would have the most beautiful, peaceful, and free Sundays imaginable.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father prided himself on his son\\u2019s excellent grades, and boasted of them to people in the neighborhood. At the same time, however, he showed a certain displeasure with Tengo\\u2019s brightness and talent. Often when Tengo was at his desk, studying, his father would interrupt him, ordering the boy to do chores or nagging him about his supposedly offensive behavior. The content of his father\\u2019s nagging was always the same: here he was, running himself ragged every day, covering huge distances and enduring people\\u2019s curses, while Tengo did nothing but take it easy all the time, living in comfort. \\u201cThey had me working my tail off when I was your age, and my father and older brothers would beat me black and blue for anything at all. They never gave me enough food. They treated me like an animal. I don\\u2019t want you thinking you\\u2019re so special just because you got a few good grades.\\u201d\\n\\nThis man is envious of me, Tengo began to think at a certain point. He\\u2019s jealous, either of me as a person or of the life I\\u2019m leading. But would a father really feel jealousy toward his son? Tengo did not judge his father, but he could not help sensing a pathetic kind of meanness emanating from his words and deeds. It was not that Tengo\\u2019s father hated him as a person but, rather, that he hated something inside Tengo, something that he could not forgive.\\n\\nWhen the train left Tokyo Station, Tengo took out the paperback that he had brought along. It was an anthology of short stories on the theme of travel and it included a tale called \\u201cTown of Cats,\\u201d a fantastical piece by a German writer with whom Tengo was not familiar. According to the book\\u2019s foreword, the story had been written in the period between the two World Wars.\\n\\nIn the story, a young man is travelling alone with no particular destination in mind. He rides the train and gets off at any stop that arouses his interest. He takes a room, sees the sights, and stays for as long as he likes. When he has had enough, he boards another train. He spends every vacation this way.\\n\\nOne day, he sees a lovely river from the train window. Gentle green hills line the meandering stream, and below them lies a pretty little town with an old stone bridge. The train stops at the town\\u2019s station, and the young man steps down with his bag. No one else gets off, and, as soon as he alights, the train departs.\\n\\nNo workers man the station, which must see very little activity. The young man crosses the bridge and walks into the town. All the shops are shuttered, the town hall deserted. No one occupies the desk at the town\\u2019s only hotel. The place seems totally uninhabited. Perhaps all the people are off napping somewhere. But it is only ten-thirty in the morning, far too early for that. Perhaps something has caused all the people to abandon the town. In any case, the next train will not come until the following morning, so he has no choice but to spend the night here. He wanders around the town to kill time.\\n\\nIn fact, this is a town of cats. When the sun starts to go down, many cats come trooping across the bridge\\u2014cats of all different kinds and colors. They are much larger than ordinary cats, but they are still cats. The young man is shocked by this sight. He rushes into the bell tower in the center of town and climbs to the top to hide. The cats go about their business, raising the shop shutters or seating themselves at their desks to start their day\\u2019s work. Soon, more cats come, crossing the bridge into town like the others. They enter the shops to buy things or go to the town hall to handle administrative matters or eat a meal at the hotel restaurant or drink beer at the tavern and sing lively cat songs. Because cats can see in the dark, they need almost no lights, but that particular night the glow of the full moon floods the town, enabling the young man to see every detail from his perch in the bell tower. When dawn approaches, the cats finish their work, close up the shops, and swarm back across the bridge.\\n\\nBy the time the sun comes up, the cats are gone, and the town is deserted again. The young man climbs down, picks one of the hotel beds for himself, and goes to sleep. When he gets hungry, he eats some bread and fish that have been left in the hotel kitchen. When darkness approaches, he hides in the bell tower again and observes the cats\\u2019 activities until dawn. Trains stop at the station before noon and in the late afternoon. No passengers alight, and no one boards, either. Still, the trains stop at the station for exactly one minute, then pull out again. He could take one of these trains and leave the creepy cat town behind. But he doesn\\u2019t. Being young, he has a lively curiosity and is ready for adventure. He wants to see more of this strange spectacle. If possible, he wants to find out when and how this place became a town of cats.\\n\\nOn his third night, a hubbub breaks out in the square below the bell tower. \\u201cHey, do you smell something human?\\u201d one of the cats says. \\u201cNow that you mention it, I thought there was a funny smell the past few days,\\u201d another chimes in, twitching his nose. \\u201cMe, too,\\u201d yet another cat says. \\u201cThat\\u2019s weird. There shouldn\\u2019t be any humans here,\\u201d someone adds. \\u201cNo, of course not. There\\u2019s no way a human could get into this town of cats.\\u201d \\u201cBut that smell is definitely here.\\u201d\\n\\nThe cats form groups and begin to search the town like bands of vigilantes. It takes them very little time to discover that the bell tower is the source of the smell. The young man hears their soft paws padding up the stairs. That\\u2019s it, they\\u2019ve got me! he thinks. His smell seems to have roused the cats to anger. Humans are not supposed to set foot in this town. The cats have big, sharp claws and white fangs. He has no idea what terrible fate awaits him if he is discovered, but he is sure that they will not let him leave the town alive.\\n\\nThree cats climb to the top of the bell tower and sniff the air. \\u201cStrange,\\u201d one cat says, twitching his whiskers, \\u201cI smell a human, but there\\u2019s no one here.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt is strange,\\u201d a second cat says. \\u201cBut there really isn\\u2019t anyone here. Let\\u2019s go and look somewhere else.\\u201d\\n\\nThe cats cock their heads, puzzled, then retreat down the stairs. The young man hears their footsteps fading into the dark of night. He breathes a sigh of relief, but he doesn\\u2019t understand what just happened. There was no way they could have missed him. But for some reason they didn\\u2019t see him. In any case, he decides that when morning comes he will go to the station and take the train out of this town. His luck can\\u2019t last forever.\\n\\nThe next morning, however, the train does not stop at the station. He watches it pass by without slowing down. The afternoon train does the same. He can see the engineer seated at the controls. But the train shows no sign of stopping. It is as though no one can see the young man waiting for a train\\u2014or even see the station itself. Once the afternoon train disappears down the track, the place grows quieter than ever. The sun begins to sink. It is time for the cats to come. The young man knows that he is irretrievably lost. This is no town of cats, he finally realizes. It is the place where he is meant to be lost. It is another world, which has been prepared especially for him. And never again, for all eternity, will the train stop at this station to take him back to the world he came from.\\n\\nTengo read the story twice. The phrase \\u201cthe place where he is meant to be lost\\u201d attracted his attention. He closed the book and let his eyes wander across the drab industrial scene passing by the train window. Soon afterward, he drifted off to sleep\\u2014not a long nap but a deep one. He woke covered in sweat. The train was moving along the southern coastline of the Boso Peninsula in midsummer.\\n\\nOne morning when he was in fifth grade, after much careful thinking, Tengo declared that he was going to stop making the rounds with his father on Sundays. He told his father that he wanted to use the time for studying and reading books and playing with other kids. He wanted to live a normal life like everybody else.\\n\\nTengo said what he needed to say, concisely and coherently.\\n\\nHis father, of course, blew up. He didn\\u2019t give a damn what other families did, he said. \\u201cWe have our own way of doing things. And don\\u2019t you dare talk to me about a \\u2018normal life,\\u2019 Mr. Know-It-All. What do you know about a \\u2018normal life\\u2019?\\u201d Tengo did not try to argue with him. He merely stared back in silence, knowing that nothing he said would get through to his father. Finally, his father told him that if he wouldn\\u2019t listen then he couldn\\u2019t go on feeding him. Tengo should get the hell out.\\n\\nTengo did as he was told. He had made up his mind. He was not going to be afraid. Now that he had been given permission to leave his cage, he was more relieved than anything else. But there was no way that a ten-year-old boy could live on his own. When his class was dismissed at the end of the day, he confessed his predicament to his teacher. The teacher was a single woman in her mid-thirties, a fair-minded, warmhearted person. She heard Tengo out with sympathy, and that evening she took him back to his father\\u2019s place for a long talk.\\n\\nTengo was told to leave the room, so he was not sure what they said to each other, but finally his father had to sheathe his sword. However extreme his anger might be, he could not leave a ten-year-old boy to wander the streets alone. The duty of a parent to support his child was a matter of law.\\n\\nAs a result of the teacher\\u2019s talk with his father, Tengo was free to spend Sundays as he pleased. This was the first tangible right that he had ever won from his father. He had taken his first step toward freedom and independence.\\n\\nAt the reception desk of the sanatorium, Tengo gave his name and his father\\u2019s name.\\n\\nThe nurse asked, \\u201cHave you by any chance notified us of your intention to visit today?\\u201d There was a hard edge to her voice. A small woman, she wore metal-framed glasses, and her short hair had a touch of gray.\\n\\n\\u201cNo, it just occurred to me to come this morning and I hopped on a train,\\u201d Tengo answered honestly.\\n\\nThe nurse gave him a look of mild disgust. Then she said, \\u201cVisitors are supposed to notify us before they arrive to see a patient. We have our schedules to meet, and the wishes of the patient must also be taken into account.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry. I didn\\u2019t know.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhen was your last visit?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTwo years ago.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTwo years ago,\\u201d she said as she checked the list of visitors with a ballpoint pen in hand. \\u201cYou mean to say that you have not made a single visit in two years?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s right,\\u201d Tengo said.\\n\\n\\u201cAccording to our records, you are Mr. Kawana\\u2019s only relative.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat is correct.\\u201d\\n\\nShe glanced at Tengo, but she said nothing. Her eyes were not blaming him, just checking the facts. Apparently, Tengo\\u2019s case was not exceptional.\\n\\n\\u201cAt the moment, your father is in group rehabilitation. That will end in half an hour. You can see him then.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow is he doing?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPhysically, he\\u2019s healthy. It\\u2019s in the other area that he has his ups and downs,\\u201d she said, tapping her temple with an index finger.\\n\\nTengo thanked her and went to wait in the lounge by the entrance, reading more of his book. A breeze passed through now and then, carrying the scent of the sea and the cooling sound of the pine windbreak outside. Cicadas clung to the branches of the trees, screeching their hearts out. Summer was at its height, but the cicadas seemed to know that it would not last long.\\n\\nEventually, the bespectacled nurse came to tell Tengo that he could see his father now. \\u201cI\\u2019ll show you to his room,\\u201d she said. Tengo got up from the sofa and, passing by a large mirror on the wall, realized for the first time what a sloppy outfit he was wearing: a Jeff Beck Japan Tour T-shirt under a faded dungaree shirt with mismatched buttons, chinos with specks of pizza sauce near one knee, a baseball cap\\u2014no way for a thirty-year-old son to dress on his first hospital visit to his father in two years. Nor did he have anything with him that might serve as a gift on such an occasion. No wonder the nurse had given him that look of disgust.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father was in his room, sitting in a chair by the open window, his hands on his knees. A nearby table held a potted plant with several delicate yellow flowers. The floor was made of some soft material to prevent injury in case of a fall. Tengo did not realize at first that the old man seated by the window was his father. He had shrunk\\u2014\\u201cshrivelled up\\u201d might be more accurate. His hair was shorter and as white as a frost-covered lawn. His cheeks were sunken, which may have been why the hollows of his eyes looked much bigger than they had before. Three deep creases marked his forehead. His eyebrows were extremely long and thick, and his pointed ears were larger than ever; they looked like bat wings. From a distance, he seemed less like a human being than like some kind of creature, a rat or a squirrel\\u2014a creature with some cunning. He was, however, Tengo\\u2019s father\\u2014or, rather, the wreckage of Tengo\\u2019s father. The father that Tengo remembered was a tough, hardworking man. Introspection and imagination might have been foreign to him, but he had his own moral code and a strong sense of purpose. The man Tengo saw before him was nothing but an empty shell.\\n\\n\\u201cMr. Kawana!\\u201d the nurse said to Tengo\\u2019s father in the crisp, clear tone she must have been trained to use when addressing patients. \\u201cMr. Kawana! Look who\\u2019s here! It\\u2019s your son, here from Tokyo!\\u201d\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father turned in his direction. His expressionless eyes made Tengo think of two empty swallow\\u2019s nests hanging from the eaves.\\n\\n\\u201cHello,\\u201d Tengo said.\\n\\nHis father said nothing. Instead, he looked straight at Tengo as if he were reading a bulletin written in a foreign language.\\n\\n\\u201cDinner starts at six-thirty,\\u201d the nurse said to Tengo. \\u201cPlease feel free to stay until then.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo hesitated for a moment after the nurse left, and then approached his father, sitting down in the chair opposite his\\u2014a faded, cloth-covered chair, its wooden parts scarred from long use. His father\\u2019s eyes followed his movements.\\n\\n\\u201cHow are you?\\u201d Tengo asked.\\n\\n\\u201cFine, thank you,\\u201d his father said formally.\\n\\nTengo did not know what to say after that. Toying with the third button of his dungaree shirt, he turned his gaze toward the pine trees outside and then back again to his father.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have come from Tokyo, is it?\\u201d his father asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, from Tokyo.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou must have come by express train.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s right,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cAs far as Tateyama. Then I transferred to a local for the trip here to Chikura.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019ve come to swim?\\u201d his father asked.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m Tengo. Tengo Kawana. Your son.\\u201d\\n\\nThe wrinkles in his father\\u2019s forehead deepened. \\u201cA lot of people tell lies because they don\\u2019t want to pay their NHK subscription fee.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFather!\\u201d Tengo called out to him. He had not spoken the word in a very long time. \\u201cI\\u2019m Tengo. Your son.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t have a son,\\u201d his father declared.\\n\\n\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have a son,\\u201d Tengo repeated mechanically.\\n\\nHis father nodded.\\n\\n\\u201cSo what am I?\\u201d Tengo asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re nothing,\\u201d his father said with two short shakes of the head.\\n\\nTengo caught his breath. He could find no words. Nor did his father have any more to say. Each sat in silence, searching through his own tangled thoughts. Only the cicadas sang without confusion, at top volume.\\n\\nHe may be speaking the truth, Tengo thought. His memory may have been destroyed, but his words are probably true.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d Tengo asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYou are nothing,\\u201d his father repeated, his voice devoid of emotion. \\u201cYou were nothing, you are nothing, and you will be nothing.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo wanted to get up from his chair, walk to the station, and go back to Tokyo then and there. But he could not stand up. He was like the young man who travelled to the town of cats. He had curiosity. He wanted a clearer answer. There was danger lurking, of course. But if he let this opportunity escape he would have no chance to learn the secret about himself. Tengo arranged and rearranged words in his head until at last he was ready to speak them. This was the question he had wanted to ask since childhood but could never quite manage to get out: \\u201cWhat you\\u2019re saying, then, is that you are not my biological father, correct? You are telling me that there is no blood connection between us, is that it?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStealing radio waves is an unlawful act,\\u201d his father said, looking into Tengo\\u2019s eyes. \\u201cIt is no different from stealing money or valuables, don\\u2019t you think?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re probably right.\\u201d Tengo decided to agree for now.\\n\\n\\u201cRadio waves don\\u2019t come falling out of the sky for free like rain or snow,\\u201d his father said.\\n\\nTengo stared at his father\\u2019s hands. They were lined up neatly on his knees. Small, dark hands, they looked tanned to the bone by long years of outdoor work.\\n\\n\\u201cMy mother didn\\u2019t really die of an illness when I was little, did she?\\u201d Tengo asked slowly.\\n\\nHis father did not answer. His expression did not change, and his hands did not move. His eyes focussed on Tengo as if they were observing something unfamiliar.\\n\\n\\u201cMy mother left you. She left you and me behind. She went off with another man. Am I wrong?\\u201d\\n\\nHis father nodded. \\u201cIt is not good to steal radio waves. You can\\u2019t get away with it, just doing whatever you want.\\u201d\\n\\nThis man understands my questions perfectly well. He just doesn\\u2019t want to answer them directly, Tengo thought.\\n\\n\\u201cFather,\\u201d Tengo addressed him. \\u201cYou may not actually be my father, but I\\u2019ll call you that for now because I don\\u2019t know what else to call you. To tell you the truth, I\\u2019ve never liked you. Maybe I\\u2019ve even hated you most of the time. You know that, don\\u2019t you? But, even supposing that there is no blood connection between us, I no longer have any reason to hate you. I don\\u2019t know if I can go so far as to be fond of you, but I think that at least I should be able to understand you better than I do now. I have always wanted to know the truth about who I am and where I came from. That\\u2019s all. If you will tell me the truth here and now, I won\\u2019t hate you anymore. In fact, I would welcome the opportunity not to have to hate you any longer.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father went on staring at him with expressionless eyes, but Tengo felt that he might be seeing the tiniest gleam of light somewhere deep within those empty swallow\\u2019s nests.\\n\\n\\u201cI am nothing,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cYou are right. I\\u2019m like someone who\\u2019s been thrown into the ocean at night, floating all alone. I reach out, but no one is there. I have no connection to anything. The closest thing I have to a family is you, but you hold on to the secret. Meanwhile, your memory deteriorates day by day. Along with your memory, the truth about me is being lost. Without the aid of truth, I am nothing, and I can never be anything. You are right about that, too.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKnowledge is a precious social asset,\\u201d his father said in a monotone, though his voice was somewhat quieter than before, as if someone had reached over and turned down the volume. \\u201cIt is an asset that must be amassed in abundant stockpiles and utilized with the utmost care. It must be handed down to the next generation in fruitful forms. For that reason, too, NHK needs to have all your subscription fees and\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nHe cut his father short. \\u201cWhat kind of person was my mother? Where did she go? What happened to her?\\u201d\\n\\nHis father brought his incantation to a halt, his lips shut tight.\\n\\nHis voice softer now, Tengo went on, \\u201cA vision often comes to me\\u2014the same one, over and over. I suspect it\\u2019s not so much a vision as a memory of something that actually happened. I\\u2019m one and a half years old, and my mother is next to me. She and a young man are holding each other. The man is not you. Who he is I have no idea, but he is definitely not you.\\u201d\\n\\nHis father said nothing, but his eyes were clearly seeing something else\\u2014something not there.\\n\\n\\u201cI wonder if I might ask you to read me something,\\u201d Tengo\\u2019s father said in formal tones after a long pause. \\u201cMy eyesight has deteriorated to the point where I can\\u2019t read books anymore. That bookcase has some books. Choose any one you like.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo got up to scan the spines of the volumes in the bookcase. Most of them were historical novels set in ancient times when samurai roamed the land. Tengo couldn\\u2019t bring himself to read his father some musty old book full of archaic language.\\n\\n\\u201cIf you don\\u2019t mind, I\\u2019d rather read a story about a town of cats,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s in a book that I brought to read myself.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cA story about a town of cats,\\u201d his father said, savoring the words. \\u201cPlease read that to me, if it is not too much trouble.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo looked at his watch. \\u201cIt\\u2019s no trouble at all. I have plenty of time before my train leaves. It\\u2019s an odd story. I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ll like it.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo pulled out his paperback and started reading slowly, in a clear, audible voice, taking two or three breaks along the way to catch his breath. He glanced at his father whenever he stopped reading but saw no discernible reaction on his face. Was he enjoying the story? He could not tell.\\n\\n\\u201cDoes that town of cats have television?\\u201d his father asked when Tengo had finished.\\n\\n\\u201cThe story was written in Germany in the nineteen-thirties. They didn\\u2019t have television yet back then. They did have radio, though.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDid the cats build the town? Or did people build it before the cats came to live there?\\u201d his father asked, speaking as if to himself.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cBut it does seem to have been built by human beings. Maybe the people left for some reason\\u2014say, they all died in an epidemic of some sort\\u2014and the cats came to live there.\\u201d\\n\\nHis father nodded. \\u201cWhen a vacuum forms, something has to come along to fill it. That\\u2019s what everybody does.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s what everybody does?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cExactly.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat kind of vacuum are you filling?\\u201d\\n\\nHis father scowled. Then he said with a touch of sarcasm in his voice, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you know?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Tengo said.\\n\\nHis father\\u2019s nostrils flared. One eyebrow rose slightly. \\u201cIf you can\\u2019t understand it without an explanation, you can\\u2019t understand it with an explanation.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo narrowed his eyes, trying to read the man\\u2019s expression. Never once had his father employed such odd, suggestive language. He always spoke in concrete, practical terms.\\n\\n\\u201cI see. So you are filling some kind of vacuum,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cAll right, then, who is going to fill the vacuum that you have left behind?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou,\\u201d his father declared, raising an index finger and thrusting it straight at Tengo. \\u201cIsn\\u2019t it obvious? I have been filling the vacuum that somebody else made, so you will fill the vacuum that I have made.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe way the cats filled the town after the people were gone.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cRight,\\u201d his father said. Then he stared vacantly at his own outstretched index finger as if at some mysterious, misplaced object.\\n\\nTengo sighed. \\u201cSo, then, who is my father?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJust a vacuum. Your mother joined her body with a vacuum and gave birth to you. I filled that vacuum.\\u201d\\n\\nHaving said that much, his father closed his eyes and closed his mouth.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd you raised me after she left. Is that what you\\u2019re saying?\\u201d\\n\\nAfter a ceremonious clearing of his throat, his father said, as if trying to explain a simple truth to a slow-witted child, \\u201cThat is why I said, \\u2018If you can\\u2019t understand it without an explanation, you can\\u2019t understand it with an explanation.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nTengo folded his hands in his lap and looked straight into his father\\u2019s face. This man is no empty shell, he thought. He is a flesh-and-blood human being with a narrow, stubborn soul, surviving in fits and starts on this patch of land by the sea. He has no choice but to coexist with the vacuum that is slowly spreading inside him. Eventually, that vacuum will swallow up whatever memories are left. It is only a matter of time.\\n\\nTengo said goodbye to his father just before 6 P.M. While he waited for the taxi to come, they sat across from each other by the window, saying nothing. Tengo had many more questions he wanted to ask, but he knew that he would get no answers. The sight of his father\\u2019s tightly clenched lips told him that. If you couldn\\u2019t understand something without an explanation, you couldn\\u2019t understand it with an explanation.

The husband\\u2019s daughter came to lunch, too. She was the youngest of his three children, and she had recently walked the Appalachian Trail, all of it, from Maine to Georgia. Now she was moving to Wyoming to work on a cattle ranch. Her father didn\\u2019t mind this, but her mother, her grandparents, and even some of her friends objected strongly. The girl didn\\u2019t seem to care. She said that at first she had cared but then she saw that they were only jealous of her willingness to do what she wanted, free of expectations, and then she didn\\u2019t care anymore. She was twenty-one.\\n\\nHe thought of himself at twenty-one. Where had he been? He had been in college. Then he had graduated and begun to work, at a drug clinic. In the summer between college and working he went to study Italian at an immersion program in Vermont, but he was lonely and intimidated, and he left after three days. He thought of his wife\\u2019s sister\\u2019s husband\\u2019s daughter\\u2019s decision not to care what people thought of her. She had described it as a sort of switch: first she had cared, then she had not cared. The switch was her will. He could not remember ever applying his will to such drastic effect, particularly about other people and their feelings about him. This, he decided, was the essence of her courage and of his cowardice.\\n\\nThat night, while undressing, he tried to explain all this to his wife. She understood him immediately, but she raised a number of objections and mitigating forces.\\n\\n1.) The girl was overstating or misrepresenting her experience. She very likely did care what other people thought of her\\u2014especially her mother\\u2014and was portraying her transformation as stark only because it was a) more dramatic to speak that way, b) more self-aggrandizing to speak that way, and c) a means of convincing herself of her own courage, without which she would not be able to do what she was doing.\\n\\n2.) The girl was not known, given the stories her sister told about her, to be especially generous or compassionate, whereas by all reports he always had been, and these qualities\\u2014generosity and compassion\\u2014entailed their own form of courage: the courage to serve others. (At this he winced.)\\n\\n3.) At the time he had grown anxious and homesick and left the language school, his mother had been deathly ill, a detail that ought to soften his judgment of himself. It was important to consider context.\\n\\nHe thanked her, this woman who loved him and who didn\\u2019t judge him for those parts of himself that most troubled and shamed him, but he offered counterarguments to which he believed she would have no effective response.\\n\\n1.) Even if the girl was misrepresenting herself in order to bolster her spirits, this was, as he saw it, further evidence of her courage\\u2014courage consisting, as everyone knew, not of action in the absence of objections but action in the face of them.\\n\\n2.)

Would she cook and clean? He had meant to ask her but then the conversation had turned. Was she frightened at all? Did she have reservations? What resources of mind or spirit did she think she possessed to move to a place two thousand miles from her family, a place in which she knew nobody and the terrain and climate were utterly different from those which she had always known?

It was like this. I was staying at a cabin with my husband\\u2019s family over the Christmas break. This large dog, maybe two hundred and fifty pounds, came to the back door. He didn\\u2019t bark\\u2014he looked in through the glass pane and waited patiently. My father-in-law, who, as a child, had shared a home with a deer and a flying squirrel, opened the door.\\n\\nThat giant mountain dog came up the steps, crossed the room, and greeted me with a gentle head push. He put his nose down between his front paws, to make himself lower than me. He wagged his tail, gently. He had chosen me. He visited every day that week, for an hour or two in the morning, an hour or two in the afternoon, following me all around the house and out into the yard, too. I get along with dogs fine, generally, but this was something else. We loved each other. His nametag read \\u201cKush.\\u201d To the rest of the family, he was merely polite. I don\\u2019t know how to explain it, but my father\\u2019s spirit was in that dog. Yes, my father had also been giant, and gentle, but it was more than that. My father was paying me a visit. It was strange, but also obvious. This was some fifteen years ago. In the year or so after the encounter, it seemed like I was meeting Bernese mountain dogs in elevators and on sidewalks all the time, but, when I met Kush, who was also my father, he was the first Bernese mountain dog I\\u2019d ever seen.\\n\\nWhere were all those dogs now? The breed had surged in popularity, then, it seemed, vanished.\\n\\nI met the next ghost at a book-club meeting at the Boulder Public Library. I didn\\u2019t live in Boulder, I was passing through, but there was a notice in the newspaper about the book club, and my husband and I thought it sounded fun. I was a better person when I was young, and more open. The book club was reading \\u201cThe Overcoat,\\u201d by Nikolai Gogol. Poor Akaky Akakievich spends all his savings on a new overcoat; the coat is stolen; after a series of further humiliations, trying to reclaim the coat, he dies of a fever; there are reports of his ghost haunting St. Petersburg, stealing coats from others.\\n\\nIt was a mixed crowd at the book club. Was the story about bureaucracy? About human vanity? About folklore? Was it a satire, or a tragedy, etc. It was the usual discussion. But then a small, thin man sitting in the corner scolded us all for missing the point. \\u201cGhosts are real,\\u201d he said. The story was about a real ghost and \\u201cnone of you understand that.\\u201d The thin man said that he knew that ghosts were real because for years he had worked at a slaughterhouse in Broomfield.\\n\\nThe man\\u2019s comments were received politely, but he left the meeting frustrated. Upon reflection, it was clear, to me and my husband, that the man from Broomfield was himself a ghost. That was what he was trying to say.\\n\\nThe last ghost was a mom I knew only a little bit, from my youth. Her husband was a professional trumpeter. I babysat for her two boys a few times. The last time I did so, they were so out of control when their parents came home that I was never asked back again\\u2014which I thought was reasonable. Later, two very sad things happened in that family: one of the boys died in a car accident, and the mom had a seizure in the night and was found to have a brain tumor. By that time, I lived in a city thousands of miles away and hadn\\u2019t seen the family in years. But one night, more than a year after I learned of the tumor, I had a very vivid dream with Leona in it\\u2014Leona was the mom\\u2019s name\\u2014and we said hello and were very happy to see each other. Really happy. The next day my own mom called me to tell me that Leona had died. I\\u2019d never had a dream with Leona in it before, and I never had another one after.\\n\\nI told my daughter about the ghosts, because I wanted to be honest with her. Ghosts aren\\u2019t real, but also they are? Or something like that. I don\\u2019t know what I wanted to communicate to her. Probably I was showing off. I said three ghosts. But wasn\\u2019t that misleading? I had spent so many years interested in ghosts, the dead, ancestors I\\u2019d never met, anything sad and gone\\u2014that world felt real to me. But I haven\\u2019t seen a single ghost in more than ten years. Wait, no, I fixed the math. I hadn\\u2019t seen one in . . . the number of years was the age of my daughter.

A short soak in the icy-cold water turned them red. From the stream, you could see the walls and the tower of the castle in the kingdom that failed. The two-colored flag still flew from the tower, fluttering in the breeze. Everyone passing along the riverbanks would see the flag and say, \\u201cHey, look at that. It\\u2019s the flag of the kingdom that failed.\\u201d\\n\\nQ and I are friends\\u2014or should I say, were friends in college. It\\u2019s been more than ten years since the two of us did anything that friends do. Which is why I use the past tense. Anyhow, we were friends.\\n\\nWhenever I try to tell anyone about Q\\u2014to describe him as a person\\u2014I feel totally helpless. I\\u2019ve never been very good at explaining anything, but, even taking that into account, it\\u2019s a special challenge to try to explain Q to someone. And when I do try I\\u2019m overcome by a deep, deep sense of despair.\\n\\nLet me make this as simple as I can.\\n\\nQ and I are the same age, but he\\u2019s about five hundred and seventy times more handsome. He has a nice personality, too. He\\u2019s never pushy or boastful, and he never gets angry if someone accidentally causes a problem for him. \\u201cOh, well,\\u201d he\\u2019ll say. \\u201cI\\u2019ve done the same thing myself.\\u201d But, in fact, I\\u2019ve never heard of him doing anything bad to anyone.\\n\\nHe was well brought up, too. His father was a doctor who had his own clinic on the island of Shikoku, which meant that Q never wanted for pocket money. Not that he was extravagant with it. He was a smart dresser and also an impressive athlete, who\\u2019d played interscholastic tennis in high school. He enjoyed swimming and went to the pool at least twice a week. Politically, he was a moderate liberal. His grades, if not outstanding, were at least good. He almost never studied for exams, but he never failed a course. He really listened to the lectures.\\n\\nHe was surprisingly talented on the piano, and he owned a lot of Bill Evans and Mozart records. His favorite writers tended to be French\\u2014Balzac and Maupassant. Sometimes he\\u2019d read a novel by Kenzaburo Oe or another writer. His critiques were always right on the mark.\\n\\nHe was popular with women, naturally enough. But he was not one of those \\u201canyone he can get his hands on\\u201d type of guys. He had a steady girlfriend, a pretty sophomore from one of the fancy women\\u2019s colleges. They went out every Sunday.\\n\\nAnyhow, that was the Q I knew in college. In short, he was a character without flaws.\\n\\nBack then, Q lived in the apartment next door to mine. What with lending salt or borrowing salad dressing, we got to be friends, and soon we were at each other\\u2019s places all the time, listening to records, drinking beer. Once, my girlfriend and I drove out to the Kamakura shore with Q and his girlfriend. We were very comfortable together. Then, during the summer break of my senior year, I moved out, and that was that.\\n\\nThe next time I saw Q, almost a decade had gone by. I was reading a book by a swanky hotel pool near the Akasaka district. Q was sitting in the deck chair next to mine, and beside him was a beautiful long-legged woman in a bikini.\\n\\nI knew right away that it was Q. He was as handsome as ever, and now, just over thirty, he evinced a certain dignity that he hadn\\u2019t had before. Young women walking by gave him a quick once-over.\\n\\nHe didn\\u2019t notice me sitting next to him. I\\u2019m a fairly ordinary-looking guy, and I was wearing sunglasses. I wasn\\u2019t sure whether I should talk to him, but in the end I decided not to. He and the woman were deep in conversation, and I hesitated to interrupt them. Besides, there wasn\\u2019t a lot that he and I could have talked about. \\u201cI lent you salt, remember?\\u201d \\u201cHey, that\\u2019s right, and I borrowed a bottle of salad dressing.\\u201d We would have run out of topics quickly. So I kept my mouth shut and stuck to my book.\\n\\nStill, I couldn\\u2019t help overhearing what Q and his pretty companion were saying to each other. It was a fairly complicated matter. I gave up trying to read and listened to them.\\n\\n\\u201cNo way,\\u201d the woman said. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to be kidding.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI know, I know,\\u201d Q said. \\u201cI know exactly what you\\u2019re saying. But you\\u2019ve got to see it my way, too. I\\u2019m not doing this because I want to. It was the guys upstairs. I\\u2019m just telling you what they decided. So don\\u2019t look at me that way.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, right,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nQ let out a sigh.\\n\\nLet me summarize their long conversation\\u2014filling in a good deal by way of imagination, of course. Q seemed to be now a director at a TV station or some such place, and the woman was a moderately well-known singer or actress. She was being let go from a project because of some sort of trouble or scandal she had become involved in, or maybe just because her popularity had declined. The job of informing her had been left to Q, who was the person most directly responsible for day-to-day operations. I don\\u2019t know much about the entertainment industry, so I can\\u2019t be sure of the finer points, but I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019m too far off over all.\\n\\nJudging from what I heard, Q was discharging his duty with genuine sincerity.\\n\\n\\u201cWe can\\u2019t survive without sponsors,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t have to tell you that\\u2014you know the business.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSo you\\u2019re telling me that you don\\u2019t have any responsibility or say in the matter?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, I\\u2019m not telling you that. But what I can do is really limited.\\u201d\\n\\nTheir conversation took another turn into a dead-end street. She wanted to know just how much he had exerted himself on her behalf. He insisted that he had done everything he could, but he had no way to prove it, and she didn\\u2019t believe him. I didn\\u2019t really believe him, either. The more sincerely he tried to explain things, the more a fog of insincerity came to hang over everything. But it wasn\\u2019t Q\\u2019s fault. It wasn\\u2019t anybody\\u2019s fault. Which was why there was no way out of this conversation.\\n\\nIt appeared that the woman had always liked Q. I sensed that they had got along well until this business came up. Which probably only added to the woman\\u2019s anger. In the end, though, she was the one who gave in.\\n\\n\\u201cO.K.,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve had it. Buy me a Coke, will you?\\u201d\\n\\nWhen he heard that, Q breathed a sigh of relief and went off to the drink stand. The woman put on her sunglasses and stared straight ahead. By this time, I had read the same line in my book a couple hundred times.\\n\\nSoon, Q came back with two big paper cups. Handing one to the woman, he lowered himself into his deck chair. \\u201cDon\\u2019t get too depressed about this,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAny day now you\\u2019ll\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nBut, before he could finish, the woman threw her full cup at him. It caught him square in the face, and about a third of the Coca-Cola splashed onto me. Without a word, the woman stood up and, giving a little yank at the seat of her bikini, strode off without a backward glance. Q and I just sat there stunned for a good fifteen seconds. The people nearby were staring at us in shock.\\n\\nQ was the first to regain his composure. \\u201cSorry,\\u201d he said and held a towel out to me.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s O.K.,\\u201d I answered. \\u201cI\\u2019ll just take a shower.\\u201d\\n\\nLooking slightly annoyed, he drew the towel back and used it to dry himself.\\n\\n\\u201cAt least let me pay for the book,\\u201d he said. It was true that my book was soaked. But it was just a cheap paperback, and not a very interesting one at that. Anyone who threw a Coke on it and prevented me from reading it was doing me a favor. He brightened up when I said that. He had the same great smile as always.\\n\\nQ left at that point, apologizing to me once more as he stood to go. He had never realized who I was.\\n\\nI decided to give this story the title \\u201cThe Kingdom That Failed\\u201d because I happened to read an article in the evening paper that day about an African kingdom that had failed. \\u201cTo see a splendid kingdom fade away,\\u201d it said, \\u201cis far sadder than seeing a second-rate republic collapse.\\u201d\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story begins with the narrator describing a river behind a failed kingdom.

I met her in an Ibsen module at Copenhagen University. She always sat in the front row and spent the hour diligently taking notes, or giving answers before anyone else could during the tutorial sessions. I, too, knew the answers but I didn\\u2019t say them out loud; instead, I waited for someone else to speak. More often than not, she was that person. When she spoke, her \\u201ce,\\u201d \\u201ca,\\u201d and \\u201c\\u00e6\\u201d vowels were a little too crisp, a little too clean-sounding, like the rigsdansk of some bygone TV presenter.\\n\\nWe were the only Asians, two dark spots among the bright blond heads of varying shades, and I wondered if she had also been adopted by Danish parents, as was the case with many Asians in Denmark, brought up to think of themselves as Danish. The only thing Asian about us was our birth, and, of course, our appearance. Over the years, I had met a number of others like me: the first when I was fourteen, during a class trip to Paris; the second in my first year of university; another was presented to me at a Friday bar by a mutual friend; and a fourth, an adoptee from Norway, had been a kollegium floor-mate. Mette Honor\\u00e9, Helle Nielsen, Mia Kj\\u00e6rsgaard, Unn Fahlstr\\u00f8m. With each, things had never gone beyond the initial conversation, an exchange of backgrounds. I hadn\\u2019t given any of them much thought since our respective encounters, but I didn\\u2019t forget their names, which all belonged to Korean-born Scandinavian girls.\\n\\nAt first glance, Ditte seemed to fit the same mold. On the last day of class, I found her waiting for me in the corridor outside the auditorium. Up to then, she had behaved as if I wasn\\u2019t there, though she must have noticed me the same way I had noticed her. In the tone of someone who has rehearsed her words beforehand, she asked me if I wanted to get a beer at the cafeteria. As we walked in silence, I thought I knew what was coming. After all, I had been through this before with other adoptees. Like them, she was surprised when I told her that I had been born in Japan, not Korea. I wasn\\u2019t her first adoptee, but the ones she had met thus far had been girls. I was, in a manner of speaking, her first boy. I learned that we had arrived in Denmark at the ages of five months and six months, respectively. We were both a year younger than our fellow-students, who had, in the Danish tradition, taken a sabbatical year to work or travel.\\n\\nWas she really all that different from the other Korean girls I had met? That was what I found myself thinking, during our third outing, as I glanced at her shadowy profile next to me in the darkness of a cinema at Scala. Now I wonder if it wasn\\u2019t so much Ditte herself as how alike I thought we were that drew me to her. (Or perhaps that is the essence of attraction: a longing to see something of oneself in another.) Like looking into an enchanted mirror: when I looked at her, I saw a Dane who looked like me. I remember, one night, we lay face to face and gazed wordlessly into each other\\u2019s eyes until Ditte broke the spell by bursting into laughter. In bed, she was very clear about what she wanted, what she didn\\u2019t want, how she felt, and how she wanted to feel, demonstrating the same thoroughness she had shown in the classroom. Her scent, the consistency of her hair, the color of her nipples\\u2014everything about her was at once strange and familiar. When she told me that she had never used deodorant because she didn\\u2019t have to, I knew exactly what she was talking about. I had never bought a stick of deodorant in my life, though I had carried one around and even pretended to use it all through my upper-secondary years, so that I wouldn\\u2019t stand out among the other kids at my boarding school. A look of recognition seemed to dawn in her gaze when I told her about my constant need to prove myself when meeting new people. In retrospect, I\\u2019m not sure what these shared moments of understanding and complicity meant to her. Did they mean anything at all?\\n\\nWe were together for almost four months, during which time we explored Copenhagen as if for the first time, with new eyes. I had never noticed all the busts, bas-reliefs and other three-dimensional representations scattered throughout the city, which we baptized \\u201cthe city of statues\\u201d because the statues outnumbered the inhabitants, joked Ditte. She had grown up in Esbjerg, in West Jutland, and spent part of every summer on Fan\\u00f8, where her parents had a summer home overlooking the Wadden Sea. I had grown up in the Whiskey Belt, just north of Copenhagen, my summers punctuated by fishing trips with my father to the Faroe Islands. She loved salted black licorice, the typical Scandinavian kind. Before bed, I used to steal mine from the cabinet where my mother kept it in a glass jar shaped like a Swedish Dalecarlian horse. We both loved having \\u00f8llebr\\u00f8d for breakfast; observing the sky on bright summer nights when dusk seems to go on forever; watching old Danish television dramas like \\u201cJeg kan ikke vente til mandag!\\u201d and \\u201cOlive og Tom.\\u201d\\n\\nPerhaps a part of me already knew it couldn\\u2019t last, the theory of compatibility that I had constructed like scaffolding around us, and whose fragile symmetry I marvelled at in secret. We were too alike, I remember thinking; it wasn\\u2019t normal to be this close to someone in so short a time, like skipping to the end of a book one has been reading too fast from the start. But the mirror at last reflected someone back at me. Around that time, I had a strange dream. In it, Ditte was my sister, the two of us separated at birth, and, although I knew such a thing to be impossible\\u2014my blood was Japanese, hers was Korean, after all\\u2014I woke in the dark with an erection, my heart beating like a tam-tam. I was alone in my bed; Ditte had gone back to her hall of residence at some point during the night without waking me. When we saw each other again, I made the mistake of telling her about my dream. Though I had left out the part about my erection, bewilderment and disgust clouded her face, as if I had laid bare some unspeakable fantasy. She asked me if that was how I had always seen her. The thought of an incestuous relationship with a long-lost sister had never crossed my mind, I said, but Ditte refused to believe me.\\n\\nThings were never the same after that. One day, she informed me of her intention to spend the weekend in Esbjerg, where her parents still lived. We had often talked about going together, but the trip had never materialized. The following night, I received a phone call; in the background I heard voices, music, as though she had called me from a party. She seemed distracted or irritated by something. We ended the conversation without saying goodbye. I eventually learned that she had left me for her thesis supervisor, who also happened to be my thesis supervisor. After that, I couldn\\u2019t walk past certain places\\u2014the statue of Adam Oehlenschl\\u00e4ger near the zoo in Norske All\\u00e9, the skating rink in N\\u00f8rrebro Park, even the oil tanks at Pr\\u00f8vestenen\\u2014without being reminded of her. The worst was going to see my thesis supervisor. I couldn\\u2019t be sure, but it seemed that the man had no idea about me and Ditte. He was out of shape, dark-haired (for a blond Dane), and his chin receded a bit. Other than his vast and bottomless intelligence, his daggerlike wit, his impressive list of publications, what could she possibly see in him? And that was when I realized that I had never really known her, any more than I had known the adopted Korean girls before her. She had become a name to add to the others. All this time, I had thought of her as a mirror, a strange and beguiling reflection, but it would seem that she had been drawn to me because I was different, a change from all the Danes she had previously dated.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The protagonist is a third-year student at Copenhagen University who feels unsure of himself and his place in the world.

It\\u2019s the first time I\\u2019ve heard the term. Black mold is worse than other mold, it seems. I know about green mold, but I\\u2019ve always just called it mold. For asthmatics, like Carl, black mold can be plain dangerous. Carl decontaminates the fridge. He holds his breath and sprays. I\\u2019m on the toilet, door open. That\\u2019s how well we know each other.\\n\\nCarl shares the apartment with a friend. Martin is hard to read. Smart, a slacker with tunnel vision. He wears a thick ring, inlaid with a ruby. The ruby looks like a blood blister. He doesn\\u2019t talk to me. Sometimes he grunts. I\\u2019m not sure if the sounds he makes have their own meaning, or if they are uttered out of pure necessity. Martin eats baby food out of glass jars. I hear the click when he opens a jar, a guarantee that its vacuum seal is intact. The baby food is the opposite of the black mold. Martin eats the baby food in bed and watches porn while wrapped in a blanket with a Betty Boop print. This is what he is: grunt, click, baby food, click, porn, click. With a future as a banker and a high-income individual, click. I can\\u2019t imagine him being able to get hard, jerk off, come. It\\u2019s as if growing or shrinking didn\\u2019t exist for him.\\n\\nWhen Martin drags himself to lectures, I borrow his porn mags, which he keeps in a rattan magazine stand that may once have held yarn or knitting patterns. A small boatneck sailor shirt for a grandchild. A beanie with a pompom on it. I think Martin harbors a lot of tenderness.\\n\\nOne centerfold shows a woman on all fours, with a machine gun hanging at a diagonal between her legs, against a backdrop of camouflage netting.

Or does it offer relief, like a doctor\\u2019s cool fingertips searching for an inflamed tendon? Her buttocks are shiny. All of her is shiny, rubbed with oil. You can glide right into any of her orifices.\\n\\nCarl has a water bed. He never changes the sheets. It doesn\\u2019t matter. He smells good. When I stay with Carl I sleep in Carl\\u2019s bed. Sometimes we fuck. It\\u2019s nice, and it feels like the beginning or the end of a love story. Always either the beginning or the end.\\n\\nCarl has a friend called Lizzy. She braids her hair and makes side buns. She wears dresses with puffed sleeves and lacing at the waist. Is this a form of irony? When I comment on the cross-stitching with a polite enthusiasm, she points out that it references a type of folklore. The dress was sewn and embroidered by a Polish Jewish aunt on her mother\\u2019s side. She talks endlessly about her family. It turns out that she and Carl are related somehow. Lizzy is the chairperson of a comedic am-dram society. I can just picture her with a wine-red costume, a tall hat, drumsticks, maybe a drum, too. When she does let her hair down, it\\u2019s as if she were naked, horny, drunk, limitless. It\\u2019s as if she\\u2019d become the pornographic centerfold. Carl has sex with her without telling me. I find out from Martin. So Martin does, in fact, talk to me. Just that once. He punctuates his sentence with a \\u201cmoop, moop.\\u201d\\n\\nLizzy is both clean and fuckable. Strict, consistent, selfish in an honest way. I\\u2019m more . . . It\\u2019s twofold. I try to figure out how I\\u2019m supposed to fit into this. I often think of the word \\u201cdivision.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen I meet Johan, the situation changes. I fall in love with Johan, and Johan thinks he has fallen in love with me. And, when this happens, I suspect that Carl is in love with me, too. That\\u2019s why I lie to Carl about Johan. Johan and I meet in secret. I want to be like Johan. When I\\u2019m alone, all I am is him. Johan says this: \\u201cThe smell between the teeth, the one that comes out when you floss, is disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.\\u201d And I know I\\u2019ll never forget the way he says \\u201cdisgusting.\\u201d The word is divorced from everything that has to do with Johan\\u2019s sense of humor, that has to do with us. Disgusting. It\\u2019s a word that\\u2019s fixed to Johan\\u2019s world view. When Johan takes a trip, I borrow his clothes and practice his gestures. Thinking of myself and of existence as \\u201cdisgusting\\u201d helps with my longing. The disgust doesn\\u2019t plug the hole, but it does decontaminate it.\\n\\nI have clean, white teeth. Under Johan\\u2019s bed, I find two used condoms. I don\\u2019t let on about the condoms. They\\u2019re something else: dry petals, a thumb brace, masking tape. Picking them up and putting them in the trash is no skin off my back. I feel the same silent satisfaction that applies to all forms of cleaning.\\n\\nCarl finds out that Johan and I are together. He says that he doesn\\u2019t want to see me. That I should make myself scarce. I remind him that he and I aren\\u2019t together and never have been. He says that it doesn\\u2019t matter what we are or have been. What\\u2019s interesting is that I\\u2019ve been lying. I remind him that he\\u2019s been lying, too. If he was in love with me and didn\\u2019t say anything, wasn\\u2019t that a form of lying? Carl says that what I need is a foundation course in philosophy. He says that I should ask for forgiveness, but, when I reply that first I\\u2019d need to know what I\\u2019m asking forgiveness for, he says that this is exactly the problem.\\n\\nOur student union hosts a costume party. The theme is comic-book and cartoon characters. The girls are Minnie Mouse, Wonder Woman, Daisy Duck, Betty Boop. I\\u2019m the Hulk. I smear myself with green paint. Rub olive oil and dry shampoo into my hair. I tear up a pair of jeans and a plaid shirt. The only person who\\u2019d like me like this is Johan. But Johan is at a toga party across town.\\n\\nCarl is dressed as the Practical Pig. Overalls, pig mask. I don\\u2019t know who the Practical Pig is. He looks like a member of the Ku Klux Klan. The American South. Mangrove swamps. Banjo on the porch. Root beer. Cornbread. Violence. The heart is a lonely hunter. Carl is the opposite of all that. Except when it comes to the heart. He has a hunting license. When he sees me he delivers a slap that knocks me off my feet. He asks how dare I be here. Another Practical Pig, identically dressed but fat and maskless, comes charging. He pushes Carl and grabs me by the shoulders, gets covered in green paint. I cry a little. Not because this hurts. But because everything hurts. He takes me to his dorm, opens a can of mussels, fries rice. Hands me shower gel, two in one. When I am nice and clean I am given food and a robe.

The wind was blowing the leaves, the leaves were dying and leaping, and the couple was so still. The couple was unmoving. I was, too, looking at them. So it was the three of us as everything else moved, constant and full and wide. People brushed by our shoulders, sweeping our sides as they strode toward their destinations. People were busy. People didn\\u2019t care about the couple standing in the middle of the uneven sidewalk.

Ilka can't remember what happened to it during the upheaval but recalls memories of the bathroom in their old apartment, her father sharpening his razor, and her fear of going into the bathroom after dark. Bridget, with her literary inclinations, contemplates the significance of being without a roof and the metaphorical meaning of an apartment as being apart from others.\\n\\nAs the conversation continues, Ilka reveals that she bought her kids a stuffed toy, a green tortoise, which she still has somewhere in her apartment. Bridget notices that Ilka's email address is MyKroeterl38@usa.com, reflecting the significance of the tortoise in Ilka's life.\\n\\nOverall, the story explores themes of displacement, the loss of home, and the nostalgic yearning for past memories.

Ilka recalls a past incident from her childhood and worries about her ability to remember certain words or details.

Desires he had none. Man-made objects were to him either hives of evil, vibrant with a malignant activity that he alone could perceive, or gross comforts for which no use could be found in his abstract world. After eliminating a number of articles that might offend him or frighten him (anything in the gadget line, for instance, was taboo), his parents chose a dainty and innocent trifle\\u2014a basket with ten different fruit jellies in ten little jars.\\n\\nAt the time of his birth, they had already been married for a long time; a score of years had elapsed, and now they were quite old. Her drab gray hair was pinned up carelessly. She wore cheap black dresses. Unlike other women of her age (such as Mrs. Sol, their next-door neighbor, whose face was all pink and mauve with paint and whose hat was a cluster of brookside flowers), she presented a naked white countenance to the faultfinding light of spring. Her husband, who in the old country had been a fairly successful businessman, was now, in New York, wholly dependent on his brother Isaac, a real American of almost forty years\\u2019 standing. They seldom saw Isaac and had nicknamed him the Prince.\\n\\nThat Friday, their son\\u2019s birthday, everything went wrong. The subway train lost its life current between two stations and for a quarter of an hour they could hear nothing but the dutiful beating of their hearts and the rustling of newspapers. The bus they had to take next was late and kept them waiting a long time on a street corner, and when it did come, it was crammed with garrulous high-school children. It began to rain as they walked up the brown path leading to the sanitarium. There they waited again, and instead of their boy, shuffling into the room, as he usually did (his poor face sullen, confused, ill-shaven, and blotched with acne), a nurse they knew and did not care for appeared at last and brightly explained that he had again attempted to take his life. He was all right, she said, but a visit from his parents might disturb him. The place was so miserably understaffed, and things got mislaid or mixed up so easily, that they decided not to leave their present in the office but to bring it to him next time they came.\\n\\nOutside the building, she waited for her husband to open his umbrella and then took his arm. He kept clearing his throat, as he always did when he was upset. They reached the bus-stop shelter on the other side of the street and he closed his umbrella. A few feet away, under a swaying and dripping tree, a tiny unfledged bird was helplessly twitching in a puddle.\\n\\nDuring the long ride to the subway station, she and her husband did not exchange a word, and every time she glanced at his old hands, clasped and twitching upon the handle of his umbrella, and saw their swollen veins and brown-spotted skin, she felt the mounting pressure of tears. As she looked around, trying to hook her mind onto something, it gave her a kind of soft shock, a mixture of compassion and wonder, to notice that one of the passengers\\u2014a girl with dark hair and grubby red toenails\\u2014was weeping on the shoulder of an older woman. Whom did that woman resemble? She resembled Rebecca Borisovna, whose daughter had married one of the Soloveichiks\\u2014in Minsk, years ago.\\n\\nThe last time the boy had tried to do it, his method had been, in the doctor\\u2019s words, a masterpiece of inventiveness; he would have succeeded had not an envious fellow-patient thought he was learning to fly and stopped him just in time. What he had really wanted to do was to tear a hole in his world and escape.\\n\\nThe system of his delusions had been the subject of an elaborate paper in a scientific monthly, which the doctor at the sanitarium had given to them to read. But long before that, she and her husband had puzzled it out for themselves. \\u201cReferential mania,\\u201d the article had called it. In these very rare cases, the patient imagines that everything happening around him is a veiled reference to his personality and existence. He excludes real people from the conspiracy, because he considers himself to be so much more intelligent than other men. Phenomenal nature shadows him wherever he goes. Clouds in the staring sky transmit to each other, by means of slow signs, incredibly detailed information regarding him. His in- most thoughts are discussed at nightfall, in manual alphabet, by darkly gesticulating trees. Pebbles or stains or sun flecks form patterns representing, in some awful way, messages that he must intercept. Everything is a cipher and of everything he is the theme. All around him, there are spies. Some of them are detached observers, like glass surfaces and still pools; others, such as coats in store windows, are prejudiced witnesses, lynchers at heart; others, again (running water, storms), are hysterical to the point of insanity, have a distorted opinion of him, and grotesquely misinterpret his actions. He must be always on his guard and devote every minute and module of life to the decoding of the undulation of things. The very air he exhales is indexed and filed away. If only the interest he provokes were limited to his immediate surroundings, but, alas, it is not! With distance, the torrents of wild scandal increase in volume and volubility. The silhouettes of his blood corpuscles, magnified a million times, flit over vast plains; and still farther away, great mountains of unbearable solidity and height sum up, in terms of granite and groaning firs, the ultimate truth of his being.\\n\\nWhen they emerged from the thunder and foul air of the subway, the last dregs of the day were mixed with the street lights. She wanted to buy some fish for supper, so she handed him the basket of jelly jars, telling him to go home. Accordingly, he returned to their tenement house, walked up to the third landing, and then remembered he had given her his keys earlier in the day.\\n\\nIn silence he sat down on the steps and in silence rose when, some ten minutes later, she came trudging heavily up the stairs, smiling wanly and shaking her head in deprecation of her silliness. They entered their two-room flat and he at once went to the mirror. Straining the corners of his mouth apart by means of his thumbs, with a horrible, mask-like grimace, he removed his new, hopelessly uncomfortable dental plate. He read his Russian-language newspaper while she laid the table. Still reading, he ate the pale victuals that needed no teeth. She knew his moods and was also silent.\\n\\nWhen he had gone to bed, she remained in the living room with her pack of soiled playing cards and her old photograph albums. Across the narrow courtyard, where the rain tinkled in the dark against some ash cans, windows were blandly alight, and in one of them a black-trousered man, with his hands clasped under his head and his elbows raised, could he seen lying supine on an untidy bed. She pulled the blind down and examined the photographs. As a baby, he looked more surprised than most babies. A photograph of a German maid they had had in Leipzig and her fat-faced fianc\\u00e9 fell out of a fold of the album. She turned the pages of the book: Minsk, the Revolution, Leipzig, Berlin, Leipzig again, a slanting house front, badly out of focus. Here was the boy when he was four years old, in a park, shyly, with puckered forehead, looking away from an eager squirrel, as he would have from any other stranger. Here was Aunt Rosa, a fussy, angular, wild-eyed old lady, who had lived in a tremulous world of bad news, bankruptcies, train accidents, and cancerous growths until the Germans put her to death, together with all the people she had worried about. The boy, aged six\\u2014that was when he drew wonderful birds with human hands and feet, and suffered from insomnia like a grown-up man. His cousin, now a famous chess player. The boy again, aged about eight, already hard to understand, afraid of the wallpaper in the passage, afraid of a certain picture in a book, which merely showed an idyllic landscape with rocks on a hillside and an old cart wheel hanging from the one branch of a leafless tree. Here he was at ten\\u2014the year they left Europe. She remembered the shame, the pity, the humiliating difficulties of the journey, and the ugly, vicious, backward children he was with in the special school where he had been placed after they arrived in America. And then came a time in his life, coinciding with a long convalescence after pneumonia, when those little phobias of his, which his parents had stubbornly regarded as the eccentricities of a prodigiously gifted child, hardened, as it were, into a dense tangle of logically interacting illusions, making them totally inaccessible to normal minds.\\n\\nAll this, and much more, she had accepted, for, after all, living does mean accepting the loss of one joy after another, not even joys in her case, mere possibilities of improvement. She thought of the recurrent waves of pain that for some reason or other she and her husband had had to endure; of the in visible giants hurting her boy in some unimaginable fashion; of the incalculable amount of tenderness contained in the world; of the fate of this tenderness, which is either crushed or wasted, or transformed into madness; of neglected children humming to themselves in unswept corners; of beautiful weeds that cannot hide from the farmer.\\n\\nIt was nearly midnight when, from the living room, she heard her husband moan, and presently he staggered in, wearing over his nightgown the old overcoat with the astrakhan collar that he much preferred to his nice blue bathrobe.\\n\\n\\u201cI can\\u2019t sleep!\\u201d he cried.\\n\\n\\u201cWhy can\\u2019t you sleep?\\u201d she asked. \\u201cYou were so tired.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI can\\u2019t sleep because I am dying,\\u201d he said, and lay down on the couch.\\n\\n\\u201cIs it your stomach? Do you want me to call Dr. Solov?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo doctors, no doctors,\\u201d he moaned. \\u201cTo the devil with doctors! We must get him out of there quick. Otherwise, we\\u2019ll be responsible.... Responsible!\\u201d He hurled himself into a sitting position, both feet on the floor, thumping his forehead with his clenched fist.\\n\\n\\u201cAll right,\\u201d she said quietly. \\u201cWe will bring him home tomorrow morning.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI would like some tea,\\u201d said her husband and went out to the bathroom.\\n\\nBending with difficulty, she retrieved some playing cards and a photograph or two that had slipped to the floor\\u2014the knave of hearts, the nine of spades, the ace of spades, the maid Elsa and her bestial beau. He returned in high spirits, saying in a loud voice, \\u201cI have it all figured out. We will give him the bedroom. Each of us will spend part of the night near him and the other part on this couch. We will have the doctor see him at least twice a week. It does not matter what the Prince says. He won\\u2019t have much to say anyway, because it will come out cheaper.\\u201d\\n\\nThe telephone rang. It was an unusual hour for it to ring. He stood in the middle of the room, groping with his foot for one slipper that had come off, and childishly, toothlessly, gaped at his wife. Since she knew more English than he, she always attended to the calls.\\n\\n\\u201dCan I speak to Charlie?\\u201d a girl\\u2019s dull little voice said to her now.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat number do you want? . . . No. You have the wrong number.\\u201d\\n\\nShe put the receiver down gently and her hand went to her heart. \\u201cIt frightened me,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nHe smiled a quick smile and immediately resumed his excited monologue. They would fetch him as soon as it was day. For his own protection, they would keep all the knives in a locked drawer. Even at his worst, he presented no danger to other people.\\n\\nThe telephone rang a second time.\\n\\nThe same toneless, anxious young voice asked for Charlie.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have the incorrect number. I will tell you what you are doing. You are turning the letter \\u2018o\\u2019 instead of the zero.\\u201d She hung up again.\\n\\nThey sat down to their unexpected, festive midnight tea. He sipped noisily; his face was flushed; every now and then he raised his glass with a circular motion, so as to make the sugar dissolve more thoroughly. The vein on the side of his bald head stood out conspicuously, and silvery bristles showed on his chin. The birthday present stood on the table. While she poured him another glass of tea, he put on his spectacles and re\\u00ebxamined with pleasure the luminous yellow, green, and red little jars. His clumsy, moist lips spelled out their eloquent labels\\u2014apricot, grape, beach plum, quince.

She sometimes said to him that the only time she felt a spark of desire was when they were out in the world, and they encountered an older couple taking care of their young grandchildren, children similar ages to their own. This became their private joke, which she didn\\u2019t repeat to others, knowing that others would most likely just find it inappropriate or sad. That\\u2019s my pornography, she would say. To watch an older man, relatively fit, at a kindergartener\\u2019s birthday party, just bending over and picking something up. Ooh, yeah, Grandpa, she would whisper privately to her spouse. That\\u2019s right. Pick up that empty juice box. Slowly, slowly. Yeah, put it in the garbage can. Ooh. That\\u2019s right. Do it. Do it. Sit in that chair. Get up from that chair. Oh, fuck, you can pick her up? Pick her up. Pick up that five-year-old body. And so on. The joke had an undercurrent of melancholy and exhaustion, like so much of what she was feeling lately. Her elderly father was alive, but he lived far away, or she lived far away from him, she imagined he\\u2019d say, and there was a division between them, even when he visited, which he hadn\\u2019t for a while, because of his failing health, and also because of what was going on in the world. When her father came to visit, he sat in a chair, which he didn\\u2019t do very well, as he often had to be helped out of it. He couldn\\u2019t stand for long periods of time, and, when she had given him the baby to hold, his first time meeting her, six months after she was born, he\\u2019d almost dropped her. Everyone she knew, it seemed, had parents who were often and actively present, who would come and stay for a while in a spare room\\u2014another miracle, the guest room\\u2014or who sometimes even moved in order to be closer to their children and their children\\u2019s children. They were present, for birthday parties, for trick-or-treating, even for dance classes, soccer, and school pickups, like strange apparitions of help and care. Despite her jokes about her fantasy, sometimes the physical proximity of these grandparents made her feel unbearably alienated, even as she enjoyed making small talk with them. They were, more often than not, impressed by her and her accomplishments, which was so different from both her father and her in-laws, who regarded her as significant only for having produced grandchildren, whom they did not make extraordinary efforts to see, because they all disliked the city, were convinced they\\u2019d be murdered in broad daylight upon entering it, because of what they\\u2019d seen on the news. It made sense to have children if you knew that you would have someone to support you. In evolutionary terms, it turned out, this was called the \\u201cgrandmother theory\\u201d: having a grandmother to help with the children had been promoting longevity and survival all the way back to the hunter-gatherer days. There were articles, in the Health and Aging section of the paper, about how to stay fit as you got older so that you could be present for your grandchildren. There was something about this that irritated her, the idea that she was supposed to stay healthy and sharp enough so that, at the end of her life, she could again find herself picking up after young children, without any wage or recompense, in this future and speculative identity of grandmother. As she was complaining about this, her friend suggested that perhaps what she needed was a replacement grandparent. Although the friend said this in a joking way, she found herself thinking about, even fantasizing about, this idea. Since her mother had been dead for twenty years, could she somehow find a replacement grandmother? Many cultures had the practice of hiring a designated mourner; a replacement grandmother would be something like that. Could she find someone to care if the baby had had a fever for five days, and to ask questions, and to check in? She couldn\\u2019t afford to hire a babysitter, even occasionally, so how could she possibly afford a replacement grandmother? But that was the thing: it would have to be a volunteer position, or it wouldn\\u2019t work. It would have to be someone who took an interest in the ordinary repetitions of her day, and who found her children special. But, for it to work, that person would have to know her, have intimate knowledge of her history, know even what she herself had been like as a small child.

I\\u2019d have to dust the snow off my shoulders and the creases in my coat before I walked in, my legs heavy, my jaw frozen, my hands burning.\\n\\nShe told me to stay indoors as much as I could, not to leave my room again until it was warm outside.\\n\\nThen she shook her head.\\n\\nNo, don\\u2019t listen to me.\\n\\nShe yawned then looked past me, at something behind her screen. A lock of her hair fell on her eyes, and she didn\\u2019t move it away.\\n\\nIt was later there than where I was, way past midnight. I let her go to bed, and I stayed up, all the lights in my room still on.\\n\\nI sat in front of the computer, wondering what I should do next, now that I was alone. The Victorian novels I had to read for the upcoming semester sat unopened on my desk. I felt it would take too much effort to enter their world that night, to move between Brazil and the United States and then England in the course of a day.\\n\\nThe computer screen went dark, and I saw my own face reflected in it. I looked pale and tired, papery, even, as if covered in mildew. I got up and splashed cold water on my face in the bathroom down the hall, then put on my coat and boots and went out on a walk.\\n\\nFrom the middle of the soccer field, in the dark, I could see into my bedroom on the third floor, and into the bedrooms of my neighbors. A shadow moved across a room. Two girls laughed together in another, tilting back their heads, with no sound. In my room, the window framed a perfect image of stillness. The whole world seemed to quieten down for that moment, for me to look at what my life looks like.\\n\\nI called her again when I thought she\\u2019d be awake, and her face glowed in the dark, lit up by nothing but the computer screen.\\n\\nWere you asleep?\\n\\nThe light was giving me a headache, she said, and took her hand to her brow.\\n\\nEverything gave her migraines in those days. She felt dizzy, her ears rang, her eyes twitched. To protect herself, she had to live in a world of blandness, often in silence, often in the dark, warm gauze over her eyes.\\n\\nIt occurred to me that she\\u2019d love the milk carton and the campus. The carpeted halls and the snow muffling every sound, the dining-hall food, the constant darkness, nighttime always spilling into mornings.\\n\\nI told her this, and she said, Can you imagine? If the moment I got there and ate your food and slept on your bed and walked around in your clothes I was suddenly cured?\\n\\nI told her about my walk to the soccer field.\\n\\nShe smiled and said, So it turns out you do listen to what I say.\\n\\nI do, I do.\\n\\nJust don\\u2019t go on these walks when it\\u2019s dark out, she said. Have you heard about the Filipino student who got murdered somewhere in New York last week? Not too far from you.\\n\\nI laughed, happy that she was back to being so unmistakably herself.\\n\\nWhen winter break was almost over, my mother e-mailed me to say that she\\u2019d received the package I\\u2019d sent her for Christmas, a few weeks too late, when I\\u2019d already forgotten about it.\\n\\nOn Skype, she waited with the box on her lap so we could open it together, her hands on my address.\\n\\nI can\\u2019t believe this came all the way from America, she said.\\n\\nShe turned the box to the screen to show me the customs label I\\u2019d filled out.\\n\\nLook, I\\u2019m touching your handwriting, she said. Might as well be touching your hand.\\n\\nShe cut the tape open with her kitchen shears and found the card I\\u2019d written for her, a brown dog running down a snowy hill.\\n\\nRead it to me, I said.\\n\\nQuerida m\\u00e3e, she said. Feliz Natal.\\n\\nBut then she couldn\\u2019t make out what the rest of it said.\\n\\nYour handwriting has changed, she said. I can barely recognize it.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t write in cursive anymore, I said. Not since I was a kid.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s it, she said. It\\u2019s very grownup now. I no longer see my little girl in it.\\n\\nShow it to me and I\\u2019ll read it.\\n\\nShe placed the open card in front of the camera and I tried to make sense of what I\\u2019d written, but all I saw was a blur. Neat lines of blur.\\n\\nShe went through the rest of the contents of the box: a tiny bottle of maple syrup, a little bag of peppermint candy, a blue shawl.\\n\\nShe put the computer on the coffee table then stood up and draped the shawl over her shoulders, swaying from side to side.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s like a hug, she said. A cocoon.\\n\\nShe sat back down and curled up on the couch, covering the length of her body with it, the shawl as a blanket, all the way up to her chin.\\n\\nWill you talk me to sleep?\\n\\nI nodded, but then I couldn\\u2019t think of anything to say.\\n\\nI thought maybe I could read her a story instead. Something soothing, nothing like the news.\\n\\nI looked around my room for a book in Portuguese, something we could both understand, and then I realized there was nothing. All the books around me were in English, and every flyer, magazine, brochure. Even my own diaries.\\n\\nRead in English, then, she said. I don\\u2019t mind. I just want to hear your voice.\\n\\nShe closed her eyes and waited, stroking the tassels at the edge of the shawl.\\n\\nI grabbed one of the Victorian novels I\\u2019d been studying and opened it to a random page. I told her all it said about orphans, and fortunes, and fate.\\n\\nI read for what felt like an hour. Twenty-eight pages\\u2019 worth of story.\\n\\nSometimes she nodded, until she didn\\u2019t, her lids shut, her head heavy over one shoulder.\\n\\nAnd then what? Was I supposed to hang up on her, on my own mother?\\n\\nI muted my mike and kept watch for most of the night. Her occasional stirs, her face glowing in the dark, her hair over her eyes.

The builders, in their defense, said that the layer had simply been forgotten about, not left out in an intentional move to save money. The building was faculty housing, occupied only by professors and their families. All but one professor were untenured. Half had kids under ten.\\n\\nThe layer had been found to be missing during a city inspection a decade ago. Repairs were put off for nine years. The school, as both employer and landlord, cited extreme busyness, and pointed out that, despite the missing barrier, no actual apartment floods had occurred. Year ten there was a global pandemic, but year ten was also the end of the remediation period, so construction had to start. The contractor hosted a virtual meeting to explain the many phases of the process. The slide show had several typos. \\u201cDemolition\\u201d became \\u201cdemonition\\u201d; no apartment number was listed correctly. How disruptive would all this be, the dance professor asked, and the cherub-faced blond contractor\\u2019s spokesman answered politely, \\u201cVery much so, ma\\u2019am.\\u201d Then the chemistry professor chimed in about particulates. If the entire brick fa\\u00e7ade was being torn off, what was being done about air-quality control? The chemistry professor had small children. Small children had small lungs. The blond man said that they would tape over everyone\\u2019s windows. They would tape over the vents of everyone\\u2019s A.C.s. \\u201cSo, no A.C.s or windows?\\u201d another professor asked. \\u201cAll through summer, no opening windows or running A.C.s?\\u201d This professor, who taught biology and kept on the building\\u2019s rooftop a colony of honeybees, was not known to repeat himself. The blond man said that that was correct. And that the rooftop would be closed to accommodate the rigging, so the bee colony would have to be moved.\\n\\nTo better address the concerns of the tenants, a second virtual meeting was called, and predictably it went much worse.\\n\\nThe third virtual meeting was cancelled, and, a day later, scaffolding went up. Spaghetti-like ropes encased the building, and men in orange vests carrying hammer drills appeared on skinny platform lifts. Windows were covered with a neon-blue film that turned every room into an aquarium and gave tenants headaches. \\u201cNo one\\u2019s complained about the blue film before,\\u201d the contractor said, though he then admitted to never having worked on an occupied building before. Clear film was procured four days later, the windows retaped.\\n\\nThe contractor did boast about having an on-site hygienist, a woman who was copied on e-mails but whom no one had met.\\n\\nFor three weeks, the noise level was terrible, from nine to five, Monday through Friday, with no pause. The new writing professor was trying to finish a novel but could only write things like \\u201cSo this is what it must feel like to live inside a tooth that a dentist is trying to drill.\\u201d The tooth occupied her thoughts nightly. She hadn\\u2019t gone to the dentist in years. Red dust coated the window film; plumes of smoke were seen. The religion professor brought up the plumes, how, from her red-tinted window, they seemed cloudlike even. The contractor replied immediately, copying the hygienist, to clarify that what the professor saw was not a plume or anything close to a cloud but a puff of smoke being aggrandized by the wind.\\n\\nEach morning, there was an e-mail update explaining which units would be most directly affected that day, though the apartment numbers were still incorrect. So, to figure out if you were truly going to be affected, you had to watch for where the huge mechanical pulley on the roof was dropping lifts. Glancing up at the building from the outside, the ceramics professor was reminded of his childhood, and that unwinnable arcade game with a bin of plush toys and a slippery claw. He was on the corner waiting for Mister Softee. He was waiting for Mister Softee because his three boys, who were inside, had told him to text them when the truck was in sight.\\n\\nThe technical term for what was missing was flashing\\u2014an embedded sheet of metal that prevents moisture from penetrating a building\\u2019s walls. Flashing is particularly important at junctions, around windows, vent pipes, etc. No one thought anymore of the word\\u2019s other meanings\\u2014committing indecent exposure, for example, running buck naked across a green field in a Superman cape, as the six-year-old son of the dance professor had done during his first soccer game.\\n\\nInclement weather set in one weekend, a hurricane muscling through from the south. Rain fell for three days and nights, and the history professor, whose apartment was right below the pulley, said it sounded as if it were raining within the walls. Could there be a leak? He sent the company an audio clip. The company responded a minute later. Leaks were impossible. They had sealed all the leaks because that was what they were here to do. Below the history professor lived a math professor, who all weekend had been collecting the water that had funnelled into her office through the ceiling. She used a one-gallon bucket, and she\\u2019d emptied the bucket into the bathtub five times. The math professor was married to the East Asian Studies professor. Not that ironically, the former was Asian and the latter white. Between gallons three and four, the former had drafted an angry e-mail to the school, but then stared at her unnuanced message. She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.\\n\\nOver text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured resident\\u2014an economics professor\\u2014to declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. He\\u2019d left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.\\n\\nWithin the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the project\\u2019s architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the building\\u2019s foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the company\\u2019s scope. They dealt only with fa\\u00e7ades. Another company did foundations.\\n\\nThe next weekend, another storm front came through. Seven gallons, the math professor counted. In the history professor\\u2019s bedroom, a paint bubble, the height and width of a man, appeared on the wall overnight. He poked the bubble, afraid that it might actually be a person, like his department chair, and was sprayed, drenched, in brown water.\\n\\nThe professors lamented in the laundry room. What kind of collective e-mail to send, and in what tone? A seven-hundred-word one was drafted, with bulleted questions for further discussion. The e-mail was edited down to three hundred words, then ballooned again to a thousand.\\n\\n\\u201cWe must withhold rent,\\u201d the ethics professor said\\u2014a thought that gave the non-activist professors palpitations.\\n\\nThe walls of the water-filled units now felt spongy, and eventually a two-hundred-word e-mail was sent, signed by all the untenured professors, and ending with the sentence \\u201cWe demand immediate action.\\u201d Within an hour, a fit young man arrived and handed everyone he met a business card. The card said that he was the vice-president of the company. The man noted the places where water was still seeping in. He said that there would likely be mold growth, and, should the mold be the color of soot, coal, or volcanic ash, they would need to call in the hygienist to culture it. Not all strains are toxic, he informed them. Some were perfectly O.K. In addition, he\\u2019d gone up to the roof and found no visible faults around the pulley system, so perhaps the leak was a pre\\u00ebxisting condition that had suddenly, coincidentally, got worse. \\u201cThings like this do happen,\\u201d he insisted, and added that, once the scaffolding was removed, the foundation would naturally rise up, against gravity, to its previous position. Then he tipped his hard hat at the professors and wished them a good day.\\n\\nSo construction went on unimpeded, and more storms came through, and more gallons were collected. Spores grew in the wet areas, none whose colors were quite right to be cultured. Rent was paid reliably; no more complaints were filed. In time, the professors all arrived at the same conclusion. Was the leak really that bad? On good days, it sounded like living next to a waterfall.

The couple is not described in great detail, but it is implied that their relationship is not very strong. The man had bought a guidebook but had never actually used it, and the woman did not know him when he bought it. They use the GPS in their car to find the beach, but the man misses a turn and becomes frustrated. The woman is unresponsive, and the man becomes worried that they will eventually hate each other.\\n\\nThey arrive at a different beach than the one they had intended to go to, but they do not mention that it is the wrong beach. They park and begin walking, taking pictures along the way. The woman takes off her swimsuit top and lies in the sun while the man goes swimming. The woman waits for him to return, and when he does, they both seem shy and awkward. They drive back to the residency together, listening to music and reminiscing about their time there.\\n\\nThe next day, they miss their trains, and the man runs a red light while driving the woman to the station. They arrive just in time, and the man leaves on his train first. The woman watches him leave, feeling distant from him already. On the drive back from the beach, the woman reflects on their relationship and recalls a line from a story she once read. The story ended suddenly, like certain European movies, and she thinks about a poem that was written for her when she was younger. She enjoys the scenery as they drive through the mountains, but when the music stops, she thinks, \\\"This is the part where Johnny Cash comes in.\\\" The story ends on this note of uncertainty and anticipation.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"The story takes place with a couple who are driving to a beach they found in a guidebook. They have been staying at a residency and this is their last beach outing before they have to leave. The man had bought the guidebook at the train station but hadn't previously opened it. The female protagonist confesses to still not really knowing him, not in the past when he bought the guidebook nor in their current situation. However, she accompanies him on the journey and they use GPS in the car to guide their way. They miss a turn on a roundabout and go around again. They eventually pick a random direction, unsure if it's correct.\\n\\nDuring their previous beach outings over their time at the residency, the man has mostly kept to himself, reading articles and taking notes, while the woman sits alone waiting for him, occasionally joining him in the water. The man appears inconsiderate of her presence, not even noticing when she is in the water with him. The woman urinates near their rented car and observes a carefree couple nearby, desperate for a beer but too shy to ask them for one.\\n\\nOn this beach day, they realize the beach they end up at is not the one presented describe in the guidebook. However, neither of them points out that they are at the wrong beach. The woman and the carefree couple strip down to sunbathe. The woman feels embarrassed when the man takes a photo of her naked. They indicate their physical attraction towards each other, though when they finally have intimate moments in their rooms during their residency stay, the encounters are distant and not fully realized. \\n\\nThe narrative confides that at the residency, approaches relaxed social life. The residents didn\\u2019t seem to spend the available time exploring interesting museums or engaging in other and societal activities worth pursuing.

As they drive along the fields and the scenery drifts by, the woman reflects on fragments of literature and a poem written for her in her younger days, drawing parallels to her current situation. As they enter the mountains, the music stops and the woman looks out the window, suggesting that this is where Johnny Cash, the American singer they mentioned earlier, traditionally enters a scene or a narrative with his music.

She is better at sentences. Games they like to play involve the former, and he wins the vast majority of them the vast majority of the time. Debates they find themselves in involve the latter, and there hasn\\u2019t been an occasion (on record) of him winning one for many, many years.\\n\\nCrosswords, Scrabble, that new game with green and yellow squares, he excels at. Given six tries to guess a five-letter word, he is quicker to recall words without real vowels (she doesn\\u2019t support the idea that \\u201cY\\u201d is a vowel), and he has the nerve to guess words with triple letters, like \\u201cfluff,\\u201d on the second try. Of course, she knows what fluff is. It\\u2019s either bullshit or the stuffing that comes out of cheap toys. But it\\u2019s not a word she would have guessed.\\n\\nIn defense of \\u201cY\\u201d \\u2019s vowelness, he asks, What about \\u201clynx\\u201d?\\n\\nLynx? she replies, incredulous. When have you ever used that aloud? Oh, look, over there, that lynx is about to pounce and rip out my heart! She is certain that any person in such a scenario would use the word \\u201cbobcat.\\u201d\\n\\nWhat most infuriates her is the presumption that she must be a whiz at words given her vocation as a writer of books. She is gifted calendar crossword puzzles (yes, three hundred and sixty-five tiny crosswords, one sheet for each day) every December, and is often dragged into long bouts of Words with Friends. In one game, he scores more than seventy points with a well-placed \\u201cQ.\\u201d She loses that game soon enough and texts him, You\\u2019re always doing stuff like that, calculating the value of each word. But that\\u2019s how you play\\u2014those are the rules, he replies. She calls into question these rules: is the point system for letters really based on frequency, or is it some larger institutional metric of mind control? He repeats, But those are the rules. On her darkest of writing days, she takes the last sentence she wrote and tallies it up for points. She is immensely disappointed. Then she stares at those crossword calendars, and they stare back. The five she was gifted this holiday season, plus several from last year. They sit all over her desk like blind cats. Hundreds if not thousands of empty squares.\\n\\nShe wonders why she is so bad at word games and has convinced herself that it\\u2019s because she knows too many words. Also, writers don\\u2019t like to be told what to write. A four-letter word for sleeveless garment, today\\u2019s crossword demands. But why is it \\u201ctank\\u201d and not \\u201cvest\\u201d?\\n\\nHis vocation is probably important: a computer scientist, a programmer, a coder. His work involves numbers and really simple words like \\u201cinput,\\u201d \\u201cprint,\\u201d or \\u201crun.\\u201d Coding also involves punctuation, which she is terrible at. An English teacher once asked her if she\\u2019d ever met a comma in her life. A comma after every fourth word is how she does it, regardless of what the word is (the answer to her teacher\\u2019s question being no), and thank God for copy editors. He is skilled with commas, semicolons, dashes, and slashes, and spends most of the workweek combing through code for a misplaced parenthesis that has misfired an array. Arrays are built into other arrays. Macros built into other macros.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t think I can write a sentence like that, she thinks. A sentence nestled into another, like whatever that turducken dish is, or, more simply, like an onion, the five-letter word she did not guess on the day it was the word to guess. Being the same on either side, the word \\u201conion\\u201d is an onion, the \\u201ci\\u201d bisecting it like a core. She texts him this amazing realization, only to thereby reveal the answer to the word game before he has had a chance to play. He texts back, Thanks, what unexpected luck.\\n\\nHe is also better at phrases, especially at guessing them when they are hidden behind white cubes. He was raised on \\u201cWheel of Fortune,\\u201d and, whenever they watch that program together, he shouts at the people inside the television, Why are you buying vowels? His favorite category is Before and After, or, to her, the category of nonsensical phrases. \\u201cNew baby buggy,\\u201d for instance. She keeps getting stuck on the chronology. Isn\\u2019t a baby by default new? And buggy, an outdated term for the first motorized vehicles with open tops? The Model T was a buggy, wasn\\u2019t it? So, on the time line of existence, an old car should come before a new baby. That\\u2019s not how any of this works, he replies. But, now that they\\u2019ve touched on the chicken-and-egg problem, they have to persist. She accepts that words came before the sentence, but argues that, in the same way calculus was invented to serve physics, words were created to construct sentences. The selection and sequence of words constitute meaning. The sentence is the final boss. After thinking that over, he says, But I like calculus, and she says, Which is fine. Great, even! There\\u2019s nothing wrong with calculus. She pats him on the arm.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s called having \\u201cthe last word,\\u201d not \\u201cthe last sentence.\\u201d So we can\\u2019t end there, with her patting him on the arm and going on and on about sentences. A piece of trivia dislodges in his brain: \\u201ccalculus\\u201d comes from the Latin for small pebble. Pebbles as used on an abacus, to count out money, votes, and distances. In medicine, the word is still used for a solid mass made from mineral salts that can form in organs or ducts. A kidney stone is a calculus. A kidney stone can cause great pain. In high school, everyone sat in metal chairs and had sore backs. Everyone groaned about calculus homework; everyone complained to the teacher, including him.

There were two women sitting at the table with Bo. Floretta was nudging Cloletha\\u2019s shoulder. Both were snapping their fingers to a jukebox song. Norman bought four beers and then sat down with them.\\n\\nIn Chicasetta, time hadn\\u2019t so much passed as crept out Norman\\u2019s back door. He and Barbara-Pam had grown up together in the same church and had attended the same segregated schools. Barbara-Pam\\u2019s mama was a widow, but, when men tried to court her, she\\u2019d tell them she\\u2019d had herself a good love. She didn\\u2019t need nary other. And Barbara-Pam wanted that kind of man, like her daddy had been to her mama.\\n\\nShe\\u2019d caught Norman\\u2019s eye when he was sixteen. He was good-looking, muscular, and knew it. Bo was his ace and full of laughter until he got called up to Vietnam, after graduation. But nineteen was still just an idea that year, and those boys walked the halls of the Negro high school like they were kings in a land where dark skin equalled royalty.\\n\\nBarbara-Pam was pretty back in high school, but so was Floretta. Or maybe Floretta was just all right. Who knew? You couldn\\u2019t take your eyes off them big legs, and, if you tried to lift your gaze, there was that nice, round behind. Floretta\\u2019s mama was a widow, too, of a sort. The man who\\u2019d gotten her pregnant had gone to the electric chair. She insisted they\\u2019d been headed to the altar, but couldn\\u2019t nobody verify that story. The mother and daughter went to church at Mt. Calvary, where the siddity Negroes worshipped and sang true hymns, instead of lining-out spirituals.\\n\\nThe tension between what Floretta promised behind the high school and what Barbara-Pam pretended she didn\\u2019t know existed had eventually made the choice for Norman. But Barbara-Pam\\u2019s shyness gave way two years after they were married. She climbed on top of him, and he found he was disappointed in her pleasure. She was not as pristine as he\\u2019d thought. She\\u2019d simply been ignorant.\\n\\nThe years abandoned Norman. He was in his thirties, past his Jesus year. He was a deacon at his and Barbara-Pam\\u2019s church, where his father had served in the same pious role. When Norman opened the back door of his house, no unexpected tremors greeted him. Barbara-Pam rolled up her hair at night with pink curlers and wore flowered housedresses that reminded Norman of his own mama, an antidote to any man\\u2019s rising nature.\\n\\nThat night at the Legion, Norman put the beers down on the table, but Bo and Cloletha rose and left, holding hands. Floretta didn\\u2019t even look toward the door where the two had departed. She swayed in her seat and mouthed the words along to \\u201cWoman to Woman.\\u201d She told Norman that this was her song.\\n\\nEverybody in town knew that Bo was married and didn\\u2019t have no business with Cloletha, but Bo was Norman\\u2019s best friend. Bo had changed and gone quiet after coming back from the war. Still, an ace was for life. You had to stay with him, or else what was honor? Wasn\\u2019t that the meaning of a friendship stronger than the bones that held your gore and spirit? Norman told himself that he was only sitting at the table to wait for Bo. That was all he intended.\\n\\nBut word travelled to Barbara-Pam that Floretta had slid onto the seat of her husband\\u2019s pickup, and they\\u2019d driven off into the dark. When Norman opened his front door, Barbara-Pam was waiting. She was tired, she said. Didn\\u2019t nothing seem to make him happy no more. He had a good, faithful woman and two little girls who were crazy about him, but he didn\\u2019t seem to care. She ordered him out, though the house was in his name.\\n\\nGiven the expense of divorce, he figured it was cheaper to keep Barbara-Pam, but he started living with Floretta full time. After a few years of private remonstrations from his minister, and his mama refusing to let him attend Sunday dinners at her house, which was only a few yards across the field from his technical dwelling, Norman compromised: he began spending a couple of nights a week with Barbara-Pam.\\n\\nHe got to thinking that all things were possible, like when he\\u2019d walked the halls of Chicasetta Colored High School. Like he was a man across the ocean in Africa, one who had a right to more than one wife. Whenever Barbara-Pam started in with her nagging, he\\u2019d remind her: Don\\u2019t get too feisty. Surprisingly, however, the loving had returned with Barbara-Pam. He began to enjoy it when she climbed on top. Also, there was the smothered cube steak she made for him on alternate Saturday nights.\\n\\nThen Floretta\\u2019s baby boy came, and she started giving Norman a settling-down eye, and he decided Barbara-Pam was his choice. They had made vows in front of a preacher, it didn\\u2019t make no sense to keep bouncing back and forth, and, truth be told, Norman just couldn\\u2019t keep up no more. Their little boy had been walking for a month the Friday he packed the things he kept at Floretta\\u2019s place, but she didn\\u2019t cry. She told him, \\u201cJust \\u2019cause the cock crow, don\\u2019t make the sun rise.\\u201d He thought about that for more days than he cared to admit, but he never could parse it through.\\n\\nThe Sunday morning after their true reconciliation, Norman reached for his wife, but she wasn\\u2019t in bed. He smelled sausage cooking: church mornings weren\\u2019t the same if there wasn\\u2019t pork on the table, and he sure hoped there were biscuits and grits as well. He quickly showered, dried off, then went to the closet, where he found that Barbara-Pam had splattered his deacon\\u2019s suits with bleach. Even his pride and joy, the maroon one with pointy-toed gaiters to match. Somehow, he\\u2019d been sound asleep while his woman had done this.\\n\\nIt took Norman two months to save enough for new church suits, and he was too old-fashioned to wear work clothes to Sunday services. On those heathen days, he\\u2019d drive to his old high school, which was now integrated. Not only law but custom had finally changed, and Norman didn\\u2019t even recognize the place. On school days, there were no loud boasts from boys, no girls fanning their bottoms. He sat in his truck and listened to the radio until he had to turn it off to save the battery.

It was difficult to understand exactly how the Jewish people had got on Anatoly\\u2019s bad side. Maybe Moses hadn\\u2019t been polite when asking Anatoly\\u2019s ancestors for directions to the promised land? Still, although Anatoly was filled with burning hatred for Jews, he didn\\u2019t admit his guilt in an assassination attempt. It wasn\\u2019t so much his conviction that upset him as the fact that he wasn\\u2019t put in a high-security prison, where, Anatoly believed, the real terrorists went. Terrorism, as a rule, is considered a serious crime that could earn you a strict sentence of life imprisonment, but for some reason the court decided to take pity on Anatoly. Either the criminal, in the court\\u2019s opinion, was not dangerous or the evidence was inconclusive. Or maybe the leniency was due to the fact that, as the state of Israel apparently noted in black and white in the accusation against him, there were no victims, no damage, and no claims.\\n\\nAnatoly had been outed to the special services by a friend, who told them that Anatoly was planning to blow up the Israeli Embassy and its Ambassador and had invited him to participate in this exciting event. The friend also handed over some explosives and a flash drive with recordings of his conversations with Anatoly. Anatoly was arrested. He did not confess. The investigators checked the explosives for prints. There were some, but they belonged to Anatoly\\u2019s comrade, not him. The investigators listened to the conversations on the flash drive and discerned some indistinct muttering that led them to make broad conclusions about Anatoly\\u2019s fantasies, but there was nothing about preparing for an explosion. The only substantial evidence was his friend\\u2019s testimony, although the friendship was unlikely to survive such a turn of events. In court, Anatoly pleaded not guilty but delivered a fiery speech about the threat of Zionism to the world. The judge gave him a seven-year sentence because you never knew what could happen.\\n\\nAnatoly was well over fifty. He had a wife and three boys. After the arrest, the youngest son, who was seven, waited a long time for his father to return from his business trip. He watched the news on TV, wishing for a quick end to the war in Donbas, which he believed was the reason his father could not come home\\u2014because it had stopped the trains from running. As usually happens with these sorts of cases, it was difficult to find the extremist. The judge is sure that the investigators wouldn\\u2019t just accuse anyone they come across, especially if the evidence is weak or nonexistent. The investigators work with the material that the field operatives have dug up, conferring on it an almost divine quality. The field operatives seize on any excuse to inflate the importance and existential necessity of their team. And this is how cases involving guys like Anatoly multiply all over Russia, while security forces receive orders and titles, TV channels scare their viewers with talk of terrorists, and the people shudder a little but then sigh in gratitude that such vigilant special-services officers are there to protect them. No one cares that, somewhere, a little boy waits for the trains to bring his father home from a business trip. Such is the state\\u2019s ruthless, repressive machine, which grinds up people\\u2019s futures. Well, at least the Putin regime has not yet resorted to mass executions\\u2014unlike the Stalinist one, when people disappeared into the unknown by the millions. Things were done quietly and in secret then, and everyone tiptoed in fear. Today\\u2019s Russia prefers show trials, to make people terrified of becoming one of those highly publicized examples.\\n\\nAnatoly was of medium height, lean, and athletic for his age. He aimed to go to bed early, before lights-out if possible. To insure a good night\\u2019s sleep, he\\u2019d plug his ears with red paraffin wax that he had scraped from cheese rinds. He also wore a homemade black eye mask to block out any interference from the duty light. In this state of sensory deprivation, he\\u2019d set off to visit Morpheus. In the morning, he rose long before sunrise. Having unsealed his ears and removed his Zorro mask, he washed with cold water at the sink and began his yoga. Each new cellmate, upon waking, was horrified to see the life-threatening positions into which Uncle Tolya contorted himself, and rushed to save him. But there was no need for help: Anatoly unfurled himself independently. During his exercise time in the prison yard, he demonstrated how good he felt, raising his hands and greeting the sun with barely audible whispers, then racing around the cramped courtyard, practically running on the walls. When he was drenched with sweat, he would pause, still not out of breath, put on a special hat with a paper ball tied to it with string, and begin boxing furiously. Anatoly was a master of such homemade devices, and this was one of his most impressive. Even the guards, who had seen a lot in their lifetimes, would stop and watch from above, captivated, as Anatoly\\u2019s ball twirled around. He did little actual boxing, but, judging by the way he relentlessly attacked and defended himself from the ubiquitous ball, it was clear that he had his own unique style.\\n\\nAnatoly didn\\u2019t smoke or have any vices, but he found a unique use for matches. He would burn bread crusts, using them to light or fumigate corners, and even creating fire circles in harmless Zoroastrian rituals. Anatoly was also studying Farsi\\u2014an interest perhaps born of his desire to check the Ayatollah Khomeini Telegram channel for the celebratory news that the Israeli Embassy had been bombed. His progress was slow, but, as Anatoly himself would say, \\u201cThe language is several thousand years old,\\u201d so he was in no rush.\\n\\nIn many ways, Anatoly was a fairly typical inmate, but, as soon as the conversation shifted to the Jewish question, particularly when he himself redirected it there, his cell was filled with visions of Jewish Freemasons who controlled the world, weaving intricate plots and schemes with long-range goals beyond mere mortals\\u2019 comprehension. The main question for Anatoly was: How can we fight all this? And the first answer that came to his mind involved explosives.\\n\\nAnatoly was a seasoned ideological combatant, well versed not only in the so-called Jewish world conspiracy but in the intricacies of Putin\\u2019s regime. For many years, he\\u2019d followed a crazy colonel who intended to overthrow Putin with the help of a couple of divisions that were loyal to him, plus tanks, submarine mini-boats in the Moscow River, and volunteers like Anatoly in a paramilitary organization named after Minin and Pozharsky. The uprising failed: either the tanks didn\\u2019t arrive on schedule or the submarines surfaced in the wrong place. The colonel was imprisoned for a long time, but he continued to direct appeals to his supporters and shower curses on the heads of his enemies.\\n\\nIn his youth, Anatoly had served in Soviet military intelligence. He was sent to Afghanistan as part of a newly formed Muslim battalion. He did not take part in the Tajbeg Palace assault, but he performed other feats to protect the interests of the Soviet Union in a distant and barren land. Anatoly talked a lot about his service, the exhausting training, the long marches in full gear in a-hundred-and-four-degree heat, his stupid fellow-soldiers, the local life, the war. He described how he had interrogated silent mujahideen fighters by inserting an explosive with a Bickford fuse into their ears. While the fuse was burning, the gift of speech usually returned. The stoic ones had half their heads blown off. Every war has its laws, none of which can be called entirely fair. Anatoly did not like to describe what the mujahideen did to the Soviet soldiers they captured.\\n\\nHe sincerely hated Putin for many reasons, including his attack on Ukraine, a country that Anatoly loved with all his heart and whose fate he now worried about from afar. It was not only because his wife was from there, or because they took a train there for a visit every summer, or because of the delicious food or the good people, and definitely not because of the freedom there after the Maidan Revolution, which he could not appreciate, sitting in his cramped cell. He loved Ukraine because it was dearer to him than his own, criminal country.\\n\\nOnce Anatoly had received his sentence but had not yet been sent to the prison camp, he was allowed a short meeting with his wife in a booth where they were separated by a pane of glass. He returned, pale, to his cell, sat on the bed, and stared at the wall. Two of his best friends, former colleagues, had gone to Donbas to fight for Ukraine and had been burned alive in a damaged Kamaz truck. Anatoly spoke, as if to himself: \\u201cAnd my wife, silly woman, came all dressed up and happy. She says, \\u2018It\\u2019s good you\\u2019re in prison, you old fool. Otherwise, you would have gone with them.\\u2019 \\u201d Anatoly couldn\\u2019t contain himself and started to cry. That evening, he burned even more matches than usual.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Anatoly, a middle-aged man, has been sentenced to seven years in a medium-security prison for planning to blow up the Israeli Embassy and its Ambassador.

The court gave him a lenient sentence due to inconclusive evidence and the lack of victims or damage.\\n\\nBefore his arrest, Anatoly's friend had reported him to the special services, providing them with explosives and recordings of their conversations. However, the evidence mostly consisted of Anatoly's friend's testimony, which strained their friendship. Anatoly maintains his innocence and delivers a passionate speech about the threat of Zionism in court. Despite his fiery speech, the judge still sentences him to seven years, citing uncertainty about Anatoly's potential actions.\\n\\nAnatoly has a wife and three sons, and his youngest son, believing his father is away on a business trip, waits for his return, attributing his absence to the ongoing war in Donbas. The story highlights how cases like Anatoly's are common in Russia, where investigators rely on weak or nonexistent evidence, leading to unjust convictions. The state's repressive machine disregards the impact on families and individuals, focusing more on their own agenda.\\n\\nIn prison, Anatoly establishes a routine to ensure a good night's sleep.

Me and my cousin were trying to learn the language, but there were . . . issues. Some people were with us, and some were against us. The former said anyone who wanted to learn should learn, we didn\\u2019t have time to waste, our mother tongue was dying. The others, they said we had too much white blood, we were not dark enough, we acted like we were too good for them! Man. Indian Country. The old guy said that long ago the people were pitiful and it was the wolves that showed us how to live with one another. The vision was one of compassion and order and beauty so fierce I could not grasp it. He told us the word for wolf. Mako\\u2019iyii. The old people, the ones who spoke the language, they had an interesting way of saying things. Even though they talked English, you could tell some other part of them was talking another language at the same time, one I should know, but don\\u2019t. I guess that\\u2019s just how things worked out, isn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nThe guy we were talking to, he was one of those old people who always wore a hat. My gram used to wear this bright-yellow broad-brimmed affair of woven straw. You could see her from way off, walking with her cane, and, if you went up to her, no matter how long it had been, she would demand a hug, and she was much stronger than you expected. It was like this. One old guy, he wore these glasses. I don\\u2019t know where he got them, they might have been the only pair of their kind on earth. This one time I saw him without them. For a second, I had no idea who he was. It\\u2019s not a hat, but you know what I\\u2019m saying. Those old people, they\\u2019re all gone now. I felt a freedom then, when I was at home and the mountains were there and the indescribable plains were there and the sunsets cast a light so serene over the land\\u2014you could think for a moment that everything was O.K. Sometimes, though, at night, I would wake in a proverbial cold sweat, and it seemed I had heard this howling sound, like the way wind sounds as it runs down and through a narrow canyon.\\n\\nThe old guy wore a black cowboy hat, and his face was dark brown and narrow with a long nose and heavy eyelids, and his lips were so dark they took on a purple hue, and he wore black sunglasses even indoors. You had this sense of import when you were around him, he was a line of dark energy running through a room. That\\u2019s how the truth feels. But there was this eagle feather in the hat band, and it was too big, it was obscene somehow, but seeing it made you smile. He might have been a cartoon, but then you talked to him and you understood why there was no in-between with him, people loved him or hated him. His hands were big and heavy-seeming and scarred, and he was always clasping them on the table in front of him. You could not look away. Like a lot of men his age, he had been a street fighter when he was young and even when he smiled there was a threat in it. The three of us usually talked at the casino, and the ones who were against us would see us, and they hated it because there was nothing they could say with him around. They didn\\u2019t know the language at all, or what they did know they mutilated like someone standing at a butcher\\u2019s block holding a cleaver for the first time. He was generous to their faces and laughed at them when they were gone.\\n\\nMe and my cousin, we spent a lot of time with him, and learned about the old ways and how you might think about things now. There was a lot of talk, how things could be if only x and y. In the end, what I learned is that a language is a way of seeing, and there is almost no way to see in the old way now. Because of the feather, his appearance from a distance was jaunty, a word that has never been used to describe people where I am from. One time we asked him about this idea of indian blood and how we might talk about it in the language, and he thought for a while. He ran the pointer and middle fingers of one hand down the inside of the other forearm\\u2014strange how soft the inside of an arm is, you could cut a person wide open\\u2014and he said this phrase in the language. I can\\u2019t remember it anymore. He told us it meant the government was watching our blood. I felt again the colossal thing looming over us all. I guess you might call it history, but that\\u2019s not quite the word, is it. I wanted to throttle the thing with my bare hands, but the past is immune to even our most desperate aggressions and, anyway, I am not the type. The old guy\\u2019s last name was Wolf Striker. Or that\\u2019s how you say it in English. Sometimes when I was alone at night I would say it in the language\\u2014Mako\\u2019iyawakkii\\u2014and imagine myself in the same place but a very different time.\\n\\nListen to me for once. Here is how it works. You look at a thing, and then you look at something else, and when you look back the first thing is different somehow. A value makes its shape known only to the corner of your eye. One day I looked away from the old guy, and when I looked back it was his funeral. I got a call from my uncle. I had gone back to school, I was in a study carrel, reading a text on Indigenous plant medicines written by a professor from Sweden. I was broke, but my auntie gave me gas money to go home. The funeral was one of those things you may not see again. The priest had tried to come in, and there was a fight in front of the building where the bodies are put out, because the old guy had said there should be no priest. I knew why he said it, and I knew that I would say the same whenever my time was near. The church has had us in a choke hold for a long time now. Someone had one-punched Father Allen and laid him out flat on the sidewalk, and then another guy stepped in and really put the boots to him. You knew it was a story that would never go away, that cocksucker on the ground with his broken glasses, crying out, Please God! Inside, the old guy\\u2019s body was in the casket, and his arms were crossed over his chest, and his best boots, the black ones with the embroidered flowers, were on his feet, and the black cowboy hat was off to one side but the feather was missing. Some of the people who were against us were at the funeral, and they said how sorry they were he was gone they were so sorry they had never been this sorry. He was the last great speaker of our language, etc. I watched them go one by one to the mike near the casket, and while they spoke I invited my most murderous thoughts to join me. Then I dropped out of college. Phone calls, e-mails, letters came, even a text. (Hi K____! Your absence from Twentieth-Century U.S. History is noticeable. . . .) I ignored them all. There was nothing left in me. I told family and relatives the things he had taught me and my cousin. This idea of indian blood, I said, half this and a quarter that. It\\u2019s just more white-man bullshit. This isn\\u2019t our way! But no one cared. One of my cousins listened for a while and then bummed a twenty spot. When I went back to school the next year, I don\\u2019t know. There was this white girl in my tribal-sovereignty course. I tried to talk indian law with her, but she just wanted to talk traditional foods. One night she offered profound and considered commentary on the situation. You look white to me, she said. After that I thought often about taking her back to the reservation. We would go to Big Bear Alley, where everyone who lives on the street sleeps in the summer. I would say, This one here and that one there and this one over here who looks sorta like me\\u2014these are my relatives. Is that authentic enough, I would say. Does that meet your criteria, you fucking bitch.\\n\\nThe dreams came back for a while. I dropped out for good. Things really do end. Sometimes, when there is no moon and the soft starry arc of the mako\\u2019iyo\\u201dso\\u2019koi is cast across the sky like a mother\\u2019s arms and I cannot sleep, I drive to a spot on the flats where you can hear the wolves. I roll down my window and listen. They come sleek and systematic and regal down from the mountains and through the canyons, and some of them howl while the others assert themselves over the coyotes and ranch dogs who yelp and cry out in the dark. You would not believe the sound. In my head I can still hear his voice.

He never tired of seeing the street split open as the bridge lifted its asphalt arms to the sky. He loved watching the rusty barges, heaped with demolished cars, floating by on river time, while street traffic waited, jammed bumper to bumper. At night, eruptions of acetylene-blue sparks and furnaces flaring behind charred foundry windows coated the oily water with visions of hellfire.

So, if she asks where to, you want to be prepared to respond, like, Well, I thought maybe we could, like, go get hot beefs, wet, with both kinds of peppers, at Gino\\u2019s.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t have to be Gino\\u2019s.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t have to be anything, numbnuts. It\\u2019s not about fucking where to. It\\u2019s just let\\u2019s walk. If she wasn\\u2019t good with that already, she wouldn\\u2019t have answered your call.\\u201d\\nFactory Windows\\n\\nWe are walking in the cold. I know this taqueria on Twenty-sixth that features an assembly-line-like contraption that makes fresh corn tortillas. A sign claims that in the whole world only two such machines exist, one in Mexico City and the other here in Chicago. It reminds me of a similar setup I saw at the Caf\\u00e9 du Monde in New Orleans, where they make fresh beignets no matter the time of night.\\n\\nBut we have wandered into a part of the city where neither of us has been before, even though it feels familiar. There\\u2019s a saline smell of pilings that you might expect in a maritime city like New Orleans, but not in Chicago.\\n\\n\\u201cMaybe you were here once as a kid,\\u201d she says, \\u201cback when you\\u2019d pedal around for hours on that red Sears bike, trying to get lost.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIf I was here before, it was in another life.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou believe in past lives?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBelieve? No. Even though sometimes it feels like it could be true.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s due to all the different lives we live during the one we think we have.\\u201d\\n\\nWe stop at the center of a bridge spanning the river and look down at a sheet of ice so thin that we can see the shapes of swimming fish below it. Carp, maybe, or catfish, bottom-feeders the ice has brought to the surface. The gulls see them, too, and dip past us, swirling and skimming over the frosted shadows just out of reach.\\n\\n\\u201cWho knew there were still so many fish,\\u201d she says. \\u201cDidn\\u2019t this river once catch on fire?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re not fish you\\u2019d want to eat, unless one of your other lives was as a gull.\\u201d\\n\\nThe bridge crosses into blocks of deserted streets grooved by railroad tracks and lined with shuttered warehouses. We stop in front of what looks to be an abandoned factory with a \\u201cFOR RENT\\u201d sign taped to the door.\\n\\n\\u201cCan you imagine what living here would be like?\\u201d I ask.\\n\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s go in and see.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s a lock.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s just cosmetic,\\u201d she says, and removes a glove, then slowly rotates the numbers she leans toward, as if listening for the tumblers. When it opens, she isn\\u2019t the least surprised. We glance around to be sure that no one is watching and push inside.\\n\\nI expect it to be dark, but the tile floors gleam at the mouths of corridors, and a shaft of light suspending dust as if it were photons streams down the stairs. We begin to climb.\\n\\n\\u201cHow\\u2019d you guess the combination?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s always the same. Same as it was on my gym locker in high school, which was the same as the birthday in May of the first boy I had a crush on.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy birthday\\u2019s in April.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI know. He preceded you. Third grade, St. Casimir\\u2019s.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat was his name?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t remember.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou remember his birthday but not his name?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMust be the kind of secret so sacred you keep it even from yourself. Know what I mean?\\u201d she asks.\\n\\nWe climb three flights and turn down a corridor that\\u2019s lined with chipped, cream-colored radiators. A bank of wired-glass windows gleams above them. Like the river, the windows are sheathed in a pane of ice. It has patched over all the cracked and broken places that shine a coppery pink through the frost, like wounds through gauze. Dusk shoots like laser beams through the bullet holes. The track of a push broom on the floor has shaped a tiny dune of shattered glass mottled with flakes of lead paint and bird droppings. We stare up into a skylight whitewashed by generations of pigeons.\\n\\n\\u201cIt feels like we\\u2019re in a story together,\\u201d she says.\\n\\n\\u201cMore like a poem.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat poem would that be?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cRemember that old anthology of Chicago poets we used to page through for something to read at slams, Sandburg\\u2019s \\u2018the fog comes on little cat feet,\\u2019 Brooks\\u2019s \\u2018We Real Cool\\u2019?

Along corridors, the radiators begin to knock, more like someone demanding in or out than like applause.\\n\\n    Somebody\\u2019s always throwing bricks,\\n\\n    Somebody\\u2019s always heaving cinders,\\n\\n    Playing ugly Yahoo tricks.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was more,\\u201d she says. \\u201cAnother stanza about how nobody throws bricks through chapel windows, but I don\\u2019t remember the rhymes. I always thought that name Vachel was too cool.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSo you remember Vachel and his immortal lines, but take the fifth when it comes to the name of your first love.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCasimir.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI thought that was the school?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey named it after him.\\u201d\\n\\nThe radiators stop their arrhythmic knocking. The windows above them no longer glow. The skylight has turned from whitewashed to bronzed. We\\u2019re losing the light. Earlier, when we crossed the river, the cries of gulls resonated through the girders as if the bridge were a giant tuning fork. We\\u2019ve yet to hear the pigeons.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019d think they\\u2019d be flying all over this place,\\u201d I tell her.\\n\\n\\u201cI could live here,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI love steam heat.\\u201d\\n\\nBut there\\u2019s no heat.

The factory is eerie yet captivatingly beautiful, with illuminating silver tiles on the once-ground floor that lay grooved by railroad tracks.\\n\\nAmidst the exploration of the factory, conversations between the two characters reveal deep philosophical musings.

I\\u2019d never thought that I would teach high-school Latin, although I was equipped to do so. As for the substitution: they didn\\u2019t explain if the teacher I was stepping in for was sick or had died or been fired; his absence sounded more like a time-out. It was not only time that seemed frozen; the school did, too. Something had sucked the air out of that place: at school functions, students did not breathe, and the teachers\\u2019 lounge featured enormous portraits of illustrious rectors, plus a gigantic one of a major naval battle. The teachers\\u2019 lounge was dark, as were the courtyards, and in those places I would sense disapproving looks aimed in my direction.\\n\\nThere was surely a modern methodology for teaching Latin, but that place prevented me from making any plans. I would go in terrified and feel calm again only once I was at least two blocks away. I felt that everything I did was wrong; my fear was a kind of animal fear, and I was just relieved that they didn\\u2019t beat me or lock me inside.\\n\\nThe school has always been a nest for fledgling leaders, dissidents, and success stories, but, at thirteen and fourteen years old, those kids were punished for any little thing; a security guard, who was said to work for the police, did not allow them to go to the bathroom during classroom hours, no exceptions. Those were the conditions I had to work in, and teaching Latin no less. The sentences my students translated went like this:\\n\\n    The slave prepares a dinner of roasted eel for the lady.\\n    The dog must be obedient to his owner, the child to his parents.\\n    Young lady, put on the light-blue toga to honor our goddess.\\n    Caesar advances forty-five parasangs with his Army.\\n\\nHow far is a \\u201cparasang\\u201d? Whom could I ask?\\n\\n    Young lady, you must put flowers on the goddess\\u2019s altar and cinnabar on Janus\\u2019.\\n\\nWhat might \\u201ccinnabar\\u201d be? The students were going to fuck with me by asking, but neither I nor they actually wanted to know. Having made a fool of myself, I would leave the school still not knowing such things, and if, as I expected, some punishment were to be inflicted upon me, at least I would know the reason. The texts used such restrictive and cruel language; it was always an order, a demand, an altar for some goddess. But the passage I hated most was the one by Arria, the matron who, with great conviction, told her sick husband in one room that their son, who had died in another, was getting better and had eaten a hearty meal.\\n\\nSince I taught Latin class from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M., I would lighten the mood by teaching Roman culture in the second hour and describing what the Romans ate.\\n\\nOne thing I always found odd about Roman cuisine was that one creature was cooked inside another. For example, you might find a goose inside a pig, and, inside the goose, a little chicken, all of this smeared in honey, the glue that kept it together.\\n\\nI would say to my students, \\u201cHow interesting!\\u201d\\n\\nAnd they would reply, \\u201cDisgusting! Why are you telling us this\\u2014and right at noon!\\u201d\\n\\nI also taught them that, in ancient Rome, people would toss everything in the streets\\u2014piss and all the rest. The lesson generated such an uproar that I wasn\\u2019t able to contain it. I was saved by the bell, but the security guard who was with the police still came in and stared at me. I fled to a caf\\u00e9 that was about five blocks away and not on my regular route; I wandered around like a lost puppy. When I sat down, the caf\\u00e9 seemed extraordinary to me, the street like a sanctuary, and the waiter a prince.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The narrator reluctantly takes on a position as a substitute Latin teacher at the National School of Buenos Aires, an elite preparatory school.

The people of the village began to gather in the square, between the post office and the bank, around ten o\\u2019clock; in some towns there were so many people that the lottery took two days and had to be started on June 26th, but in this village, where there were only about three hundred people, the whole lottery took only about two hours, so it could begin at ten o\\u2019clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner.\\n\\nThe children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous play, and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix\\u2014the villagers pronounced this name \\u201cDellacroy\\u201d\\u2014eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at the boys, and the very small children rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.\\n\\nSoon the men began to gather, surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother\\u2019s grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother.\\n\\nThe lottery was conducted\\u2014as were the square dances, the teen-age club, the Halloween program\\u2014by Mr. Summers, who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him, because he had no children and his wife was a scold. When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called, \\u201cLittle late today, folks.\\u201d The postmaster, Mr. Graves, followed him, carrying a three-legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between themselves and the stool, and when Mr. Summers said, \\u201cSome of you fellows want to give me a hand?,\\u201d there was a hesitation before two men, Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers inside it.\\n\\nThe original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box now resting on the stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest man in town, was born. Mr. Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box, but no one liked to upset even as much tradition as was represented by the black box. There was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down to make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking again about a new box, but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything\\u2019s being done. The black box grew shabbier each year; by now it was no longer completely black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in some places faded or stained.\\n\\nMr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, held the black box securely on the stool until Mr. Summers had stirred the papers thoroughly with his hand. Because so much of the ritual had been forgotten or discarded, Mr. Summers had been successful in having slips of paper substituted for the chips of wood that had been used for generations. Chips of wood, Mr. Summers had argued, had been all very well when the village was tiny, but now that the population was more than three hundred and likely to keep on growing, it was necessary to use something that would fit more easily into the black box. The night before the lottery, Mr. Summers and Mr. Graves made up the slips of paper and put them into the box, and it was then taken to the safe of Mr. Summers\\u2019 coal company and locked up until Mr. Summers was ready to take it to the square next morning. The rest of the year, the box was put away, sometimes one place, sometimes another; it had spent one year in Mr. Graves\\u2019 barn and another year underfoot in the post office, and sometimes it was set on a shelf in the Martin grocery and left there.\\n\\nThere was a great deal of fussing to be done before Mr. Summers declared the lottery open. There were the lists to make up\\u2014of heads of families, heads of households in each family, members of each household in each family. There was the proper swearing-in of Mr. Summers by the postmaster, as the official of the lottery; at one time, some people remembered, there had been a recital of some sort, performed by the official of the lottery, a perfunctory, tuneless chant that had been rattled off duly each year; some people believed that the official of the lottery used to stand just so when he said or sang it, others believed that he was supposed to walk among the people, but years and years ago this part of the ritual had been allowed to lapse. There had been, also, a ritual salute, which the official of the lottery had had to use in addressing each person who came up to draw from the box, but this also had changed with time, until now it was felt necessary only for the official to speak to each person approaching. Mr. Summers was very good at all this; in his clean white shirt and blue jeans, with one hand resting carelessly on the black box, he seemed very proper and important as he talked interminably to Mr. Graves and the Martins.\\n\\nJust as Mr. Summers finally left off talking and turned to the assembled villagers, Mrs. Hutchinson came hurriedly along the path to the square, her sweater thrown over her shoulders, and slid into place in the back of the crowd. \\u201cClean forgot what day it was,\\u201d she said to Mrs. Delacroix, who stood next to her, and they both laughed softly. \\u201cThought my old man was out back stacking wood,\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson went on, \\u201cand then I looked out the window and the kids was gone, and then I remembered it was the twenty-seventh and came a-running.\\u201d She dried her hands on her apron, and Mrs. Delacroix said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re in time, though. They\\u2019re still talking away up there.\\u201d\\n\\nMrs. Hutchinson craned her neck to see through the crowd and found her husband and children standing near the front. She tapped Mrs. Delacroix on the arm as a farewell and began to make her way through the crowd. The people separated good-humoredly to let her through; two or three people said, in voices just loud enough to be heard across the crowd, \\u201cHere comes your Mrs., Hutchinson,\\u201d and \\u201cBill, she made it after all.\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson reached her husband, and Mr. Summers, who had been waiting, said cheerfully, \\u201cThought we were going to have to get on without you, Tessie.\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson said, grinning, \\u201cWouldn\\u2019t have me leave m\\u2019dishes in the sink, now, would you, Joe?,\\u201d and soft laughter ran through the crowd as the people stirred back into position after Mrs. Hutchinson\\u2019s arrival.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, now,\\u201d Mr. Summers said soberly, \\u201cguess we better get started, get this over with, so\\u2019s we can go back to work. Anybody ain\\u2019t here?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDunbar,\\u201d several people said. \\u201cDunbar, Dunbar.\\u201d\\n\\nMr. Summers consulted his list. \\u201cClyde Dunbar,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s right. He\\u2019s broke his leg, hasn\\u2019t he? Who\\u2019s drawing for him?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMe, I guess,\\u201d a woman said, and Mr. Summers turned to look at her. \\u201cWife draws for her husband,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. \\u201cDon\\u2019t you have a grown boy to do it for you, Janey?\\u201d Although Mr. Summers and everyone else in the village knew the answer perfectly well, it was the business of the official of the lottery to ask such questions formally. Mr. Summers waited with an expression of polite interest while Mrs. Dunbar answered.\\n\\n\\u201cHorace\\u2019s not but sixteen yet,\\u201d Mrs. Dunbar said regretfully. \\u201cGuess I gotta fill in for the old man this year.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cRight,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. He made a note on the list he was holding. Then he asked, \\u201cWatson boy drawing this year?\\u201d\\n\\nA tall boy in the crowd raised his hand. \\u201cHere,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m drawing for m\\u2019mother and me.\\u201d He blinked his eyes nervously and ducked his head as several voices in the crowd said things like \\u201cGood fellow, Jack,\\u201d and \\u201cGlad to see your mother\\u2019s got a man to do it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, \\u201cguess that\\u2019s everyone.

Keep the paper folded in your hand without looking at it until everyone has had a turn. Everything clear?\\u201d\\n\\nThe people had done it so many times that they only half listened to the directions; most of them were quiet, wetting their lips, not looking around. Then Mr. Summers raised one hand high and said, \\u201cAdams.\\u201d A man disengaged himself from the crowd and came forward. \\u201cHi, Steve,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, and Mr. Adams said, \\u201cHi, Joe.\\u201d They grinned at one another humorlessly and nervously. Then Mr. Adams reached into the black box and took out a folded paper. He held it firmly by one corner as he turned and went hastily back to his place in the crowd, where he stood a little apart from his family, not looking down at his hand.\\n\\n\\u201cAllen,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. \\u201cAnderson. . . .

Delacroix.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThere goes my old man,\\u201d Mrs. Delacroix said. She held her breath while her husband went forward.\\n\\n\\u201cDunbar,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, and Mrs. Dunbar went steadily to the box while one of the women said, \\u201cGo on, Janey,\\u201d and another said, \\u201cThere she goes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re next,\\u201d Mrs. Graves said. She watched while Mr. Graves came around from the side of the box, greeted Mr. Summers gravely, and selected a slip of paper from the box. By now, all through the crowd there were men holding the small folded papers in their large hands, turning them over and over nervously. Mrs. Dunbar and her two sons stood together, Mrs. Dunbar holding the slip of paper.\\n\\n\\u201cHarburt. . . . Hutchinson.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGet up there, Bill,\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson said, and the people near her laughed.\\n\\n\\u201cJones.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey do say,\\u201d Mr. Adams said to Old Man Warner, who stood next to him, \\u201cthat over in the north village they\\u2019re talking of giving up the lottery.\\u201d\\n\\nOld Man Warner snorted. \\u201cPack of crazy fools,\\u201d he said. \\u201cListening to the young folks, nothing\\u2019s good enough for them. Next thing you know, they\\u2019ll be wanting to go back to living in caves, nobody work any more, live that way for a while. Used to be a saying about \\u2018Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon.\\u2019 First thing you know, we\\u2019d all be eating stewed chickweed and acorns.

Then he called, \\u201cWarner.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSeventy-seventh year I been in the lottery,\\u201d Old Man Warner said as he went through the crowd. \\u201cSeventy-seventh time.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWatson.\\u201d The tall boy came awkwardly through the crowd. Someone said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t be nervous, Jack,\\u201d and Mr. Summers said, \\u201cTake your time, son.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cZanini.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter that, there was a long pause, a breathless pause, until Mr. Summers, holding his slip of paper in the air, said, \\u201cAll right, fellows.\\u201d For a minute, no one moved, and then all the slips of paper were opened. Suddenly, all the women began to speak at once, saying, \\u201cWho is it?,\\u201d \\u201cWho\\u2019s got it?,\\u201d \\u201cIs it the Dunbars?,\\u201d \\u201cIs it the Watsons?\\u201d Then the voices began to say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s Hutchinson. It\\u2019s Bill,\\u201d \\u201cBill Hutchinson\\u2019s got it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGo tell your father,\\u201d Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son.\\n\\nPeople began to look around to see the Hutchinsons. Bill Hutchinson was standing quiet, staring down at the paper in his hand. Suddenly, Tessie Hutchinson shouted to Mr. Summers, \\u201cYou didn\\u2019t give him time enough to take any paper he wanted. I saw you. It wasn\\u2019t fair!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBe a good sport, Tessie,\\u201d Mrs. Delacroix called, and Mrs. Graves said, \\u201cAll of us took the same chance.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cShut up, Tessie,\\u201d Bill Hutchinson said.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, everyone,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, \\u201cthat was done pretty fast, and now we\\u2019ve got to be hurrying a little more to get done in time.\\u201d He consulted his next list. \\u201cBill,\\u201d he said, \\u201cyou draw for the Hutchinson family. You got any other households in the Hutchinsons?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s Don and Eva,\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson yelled. \\u201cMake them take their chance!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDaughters draw with their husbands\\u2019 families, Tessie,\\u201d Mr. Summers said gently. \\u201cYou know that as well as anyone else.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t fair,\\u201d Tessie said.\\n\\n\\u201cI guess not, Joe,\\u201d Bill Hutchinson said regretfully. \\u201cMy daughter draws with her husband\\u2019s family, that\\u2019s only fair. And I\\u2019ve got no other family except the kids.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen, as far as drawing for families is concerned, it\\u2019s you,\\u201d Mr. Summers said in explanation, \\u201cand as far as drawing for households is concerned, that\\u2019s you, too. Right?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cRight,\\u201d Bill Hutchinson said.\\n\\n\\u201cHow many kids, Bill?\\u201d Mr. Summers asked formally.\\n\\n\\u201cThree,\\u201d Bill Hutchinson said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s Bill, Jr., and Nancy, and little Dave. And Tessie and me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAll right, then,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. \\u201cHarry, you got their tickets back?\\u201d\\n\\nMr. Graves nodded and held up the slips of paper. \\u201cPut them in the box, then,\\u201d Mr. Summers directed. \\u201cTake Bill\\u2019s and put it in.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI think we ought to start over,\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson said, as quietly as she could. \\u201cI tell you it wasn\\u2019t fair. You didn\\u2019t give him time enough to choose. Everybody saw that.\\u201d\\n\\nMr. Graves had selected the five slips and put them in the box, and he dropped all the papers but those onto the ground, where the breeze caught them and lifted them off.\\n\\n\\u201cListen, everybody,\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson was saying to the people around her.\\n\\n\\u201cReady, Bill?\\u201d Mr. Summers asked, and Bill Hutchinson, with one quick glance around at his wife and children, nodded.\\n\\n\\u201cRemember,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, \\u201ctake the slips and keep them folded until each person has taken one. Harry, you help little Dave.\\u201d Mr. Graves took the hand of the little boy, who came willingly with him up to the box. \\u201cTake a paper out of the box, Davy,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. Davy put his hand into the box and laughed. \\u201cTake just one paper,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. \\u201cHarry, you hold it for him.\\u201d Mr. Graves took the child\\u2019s hand and removed the folded paper from the tight fist and held it while little Dave stood next to him and looked up at him wonderingly.\\n\\n\\u201cNancy next,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. Nancy was twelve, and her school friends breathed heavily as she went forward, switching her skirt, and took a slip daintily from the box. \\u201cBill, Jr.,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, and Billy, his face red and his feet overlarge, nearly knocked the box over as he got a paper out. \\u201cTessie,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. She hesitated for a minute, looking around defiantly, and then set her lips and went up to the box. She snatched a paper out and held it behind her.\\n\\n\\u201cBill,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, and Bill Hutchinson reached into the box and felt around, bringing his hand out at last with the slip of paper in it.\\n\\nThe crowd was quiet. A girl whispered, \\u201cI hope it\\u2019s not Nancy,\\u201d and the sound of the whisper reached the edges of the crowd.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not the way it used to be,\\u201d Old Man Warner said clearly. \\u201cPeople ain\\u2019t the way they used to be.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAll right,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. \\u201cOpen the papers. Harry, you open little Dave\\u2019s.\\u201d\\n\\nMr. Graves opened the slip of paper and there was a general sigh through the crowd as he held it up and everyone could see that it was blank. Nancy and Bill, Jr., opened theirs at the same time, and both beamed and laughed, turning around to the crowd and holding their slips of paper above their heads.\\n\\n\\u201cTessie,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. There was a pause, and then Mr. Summers looked at Bill Hutchinson, and Bill unfolded his paper and showed it. It was blank.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s Tessie,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, and his voice was hushed. \\u201cShow us her paper, Bill.\\u201d\\n\\nBill Hutchinson went over to his wife and forced the slip of paper out of her hand. It had a black spot on it, the black spot Mr. Summers had made the night before with the heavy pencil in the coal-company office. Bill Hutchinson held it up, and there was a stir in the crowd.\\n\\n\\u201cAll right, folks,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. \\u201cLet\\u2019s finish quickly.\\u201d\\n\\nAlthough the villagers had forgotten the ritual and lost the original black box, they still remembered to use stones. The pile of stones the boys had made earlier was ready; there were stones on the ground with the blowing scraps of paper that had come out of the box. Mrs. Delacroix selected a stone so large she had to pick it up with both hands and turned to Mrs. Dunbar. \\u201cCome on,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHurry up.\\u201d\\n\\nMrs. Dunbar had small stones in both hands, and she said, gasping for breath. \\u201cI can\\u2019t run at all. You\\u2019ll have to go ahead and I\\u2019ll catch up with you.\\u201d\\n\\nThe children had stones already, and someone gave little Davy Hutchinson a few pebbles.\\n\\nTessie Hutchinson was in the center of a cleared space by now, and she held her hands out desperately as the villagers moved in on her. \\u201cIt isn\\u2019t fair,\\u201d she said. A stone hit her on the side of the head.\\n\\nOld Man Warner was saying, \\u201cCome on, come on, everyone.\\u201d Steve Adams was in the front of the crowd of villagers, with Mrs. Graves beside him.\\n\\n\\u201cIt isn\\u2019t fair, it isn\\u2019t right,\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson screamed, and then they were upon her.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In a small village, the annual lottery is about to take place.

You don\\u2019t walk, you creep. Some days you crawl. Others, best just to lie still. The closets are full of ghosts. Blouses she wore when she was twenty-six. A denim skirt. Killer dresses. Shoes\\u2014heels, pumps, a pair of Capezio tap shoes\\u2014entombed in boxes. When you open the closet door her coats hold still, suspecting they\\u2019re gonners. Threads of memory. She wore this one there, that one here. Every garment a chapter. The clothes of the dead have no future. You could burn them. You could leave them be, decades of sartorial history hanging from a pole sagging with the weight of remembrance. You could cross-dress with a vengeance. Everything Must Go. Not discarded, donated. To the Women\\u2019s Shelter, cartons and paper bags and piles of clothes, until the woman behind the counter says they\\u2019re overstocked. You\\u2019re tempted to take them all back. Who denies the donation of a dead woman\\u2019s clothes? The rest to St. Vincent DePaul\\u2019s, and there her cottons and linens and rayon blends are added to bins heaped with corduroy and polyester. (But for one satin nightgown that will not be donated.) Until the closets seem empty. Your clothes don\\u2019t count\\u2014they aren\\u2019t you, but just neglected shirts, pants, and jackets. As summer wanes, you open a drawer and find sweaters, scarves, wool hats and gloves. Gear for a woman who understood winter. You send sweaters and shawls and silk scarves to the women and girls in her family. They respond with photographs of ten year old daughters wrapped in blue for the fifth grade\\u2019s Colonial Day. Still you are possessed by possessions. Even after you dispossess yourself, they turn up in the kitchen drawers and cabinets, where she kept jars of dry goods, beans and grains, future meals. And there, in the freezer, plastic containers: soups, tomato sauce, chili. Nutritional messages from the afterlife. Hoard them. Defrost only as a last resort. Yet through the winter the freezer becomes as spacious and cold as your heart. By the time you open the last tub, labeled Black Bean Chili 3/14/10, food no longer has any meaning. It\\u2019s no longer an act of love, a gesture of kindness. There is no intimacy in tuna salad or in marinating chicken thighs. It\\u2019s embarrassing to recall how often you ate by candlelight; it\\u2019s like the satin nightgown tucked away in a drawer you never open. Instead just heat and serve. Just nuke it. Just eat. Overcooked sustenance. When you eat dinner right out of the skillet or pot, the temptation is to glance over your shoulder in shame. No one is watching, except the cookbooks. Shelves of cookbooks, back issues of Gourmet and Bon Appetit, and a three-ring binder stuffed with recipes, a culinary legacy handed down from grandmother to mother to daughter. Recipes written in her short hand, scrolls and waves and loops fetching across the page with an occasional word, a white cap of English. Instructions for future meals, for candlelight dinners, for guests. There are no recipes now, there are no guests; no need for the wedding china, the good tablecloth. Don\\u2019t forget Widower\\u2019s Rule #1: Never turn down a dinner invitation. You\\u2019re the guest now. And after dinner you walk about the house, speaking to the dark. Go ahead, come back and haunt me. Move the book on the table. Slam the bedroom door. Anything, I\\u2019m ready. Go ahead, I dare you. Scare me to death. I am ready. The reply is the deepest silence. Yet sometimes you feel her in the silence: nothing moves, no hinges creak, no lights flicker. Just her silence. Fuck you, Stephen Spielberg; death has no special effects. There is no possession, just possessions. To break the silence you play music. CDs in horizontal stacks; vertical rows of plastic jewel boxes, never properly alphabetized (as she so often suggested). Songs with melodies, lyrics, choruses, verses, movements, codas. Songs you can\\u2019t live without. Songs you\\u2019ll never listen to again. Songs you know by heart. Songs you want to forget. Songs you can\\u2019t forget. Songs for dinner, for reading, for dancing, for killing a bottle of wine, for making love. Songs to break the silence. Songs against eternal darkness. But one day (maybe) you\\u2019ll make a deal with the silence. You\\u2019ll sit in her grandparents\\u2019 chair and it will only be a chair. Or you could give it away. All of it. Everything. Everything except the stones. She was forever (or so it seemed) gathering beach stones. She\\u2019d return from a beach with her coat pockets sagging, doing her best Virginia Woolf. Round stones, egg-shaped stones, disk-shaped stones, stones ground smooth by water and time. Stones from England, Scotland, Ireland, Italy, Turkey, Cape Cod. Stones stored in shoe boxes, in plastic bags, in bowls; clusters of stones distributed about the house like incense. She liked the look of them, the feel of them, rattling in her palm. You could get rid of it all, but not the stones. You could walk on them, sleep on them, sit on them, eat off of them. Your house would be silent, filled with stones. You would have solitude.

The narrator decides to donate most of their late wife\\u2019s clothes to a Women's Shelter and St. Vincent De Paul\\u2019s, but keep certain sentimental pieces to remember her by.\\n\\nThe dispossessing process extends beyond the closets, as remnants of the wife still linger in the kitchen drawers and cabinets, with frozen meals that were made before her passing. The narrator maintains an intimate connection to these possessions, even as the meaning and enjoyment derived from them disappears. They shift from cooking elaborate meals and speaking the language of love to simply overcooking convenience food and dining alone. Cookbooks, cookware, and lonesome suppertime conversations become the lone remnants of their efforts in the culinary arts, leading the narrator to participant in society as a guest rather than a host.\\n\\nHaunted memories consume their thoughts, and despite their acceptance of mourning, they invite the supernatural. To combat the silence, the narrator plays music, but it comes with mixed emotions, triggering both regret and solace. The songs hold the dual purpose of breaking the silence and warding off eternal darkness. Nevertheless, they face an eventual confrontation with the silence, possibly making peace with their loss.\\n\\nThe narrator considers releasing all their possessions tailor\\u2014with the sole exception of the stones their wife collected from different beaches. These hold immense sentimental value and become symbols of their eternal bond. The concept of solitude not equating with loneliness comes to the fore \\u2014the stones reminding the narrator of their wife's presence in their life. They find solace in not being alone through the simple presence of these preserved beach stones.\", \"story_token_count\": 1355, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 296, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 455}, {\"Title\": \"Ramona\", \"Author\": \"Sarah Gerkensmeyer\", \"story\": \"Ramona used to say, \\u201cWhen it\\u2019s on the outside I feel self-conscious.\\u201d\\n\\nWe did overnights at her house that summer. After finishing the sixth grade, we had stopped calling them sleepovers. Ramona had a full-sized bed, but I still felt scrunched up next to her when we were in it. We didn\\u2019t press into each other while we slept, but I think I felt pushed up against her because of what I knew about her heart. About how sometimes it flipped and somersaulted and somehow ended up on the outside of her skin, resting there on the wrong side of her body for a few seconds like a wild bird afraid to fly away but so eager to do it.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen my family moved here, I was afraid I wouldn\\u2019t make a single friend.\\u201d\\n\\nI told Ramona this while we were sitting out on her front steps at dusk, sucking on popsicles and bored out of our minds. We didn\\u2019t say it, but we were waiting for something big to happen. We were waiting for a boy to call and ask for one of us. Or better yet: for a boy\\u2014two of them!\\u2014to pass by Ramona\\u2019s house, trying to slouch their shoulders and barely nod while glancing our way. But half of the summer was dead already and neither of those things had happened.\\n\\n\\u201cI thought meeting new people would be hard,\\u201d I said, chewing on my splintered popsicle stick. \\u201cAnd then bam, I met you.\\u201d\\n\\nThis wasn\\u2019t exactly true. I felt the urge to exaggerate things when I was around Ramona. I found myself making up little lies. I was the only person in the entire world who knew about her heart thing. I felt like I owed her something. I had nothing to confess, and so I made things up.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m afraid of being abducted by aliens,\\u201d I lied.\\n\\n\\u201cI shoplifted a bag of peanut M&Ms in the checkout line, standing right next to my mom,\\u201d I lied.\\n\\n\\u201cSheila Hastings is stupid. Her bangs are ugly,\\u201d I lied. \\u201cAnd I kicked her once in the hallway on the way to lunch.\\u201d\\n\\nThat summer, three bad things happened. Matt Gowen\\u2019s dad died of cancer. Tracy Turner\\u2019s dog Velvet got run over by a minivan. And then, at the beginning of August, Troy Benson\\u2019s little brother climbed into the baby pool and started to drown in only a few inches of water. The paramedics had to do CPR, and we all decided he\\u2019d be messed up forever after going through something like that.\\n\\n\\u201cI wonder what it would be like if I started jogging,\\u201d Ramona said one night while we were sitting on her bed, painting our toenails lime green.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s all she said, but I knew exactly what she meant. Some girls our age had started jogging around the neighborhood in packs. It was the girls who had started to develop. They didn\\u2019t jog because it was healthy. They jogged so they could wear tight, neon-colored exercise clothes, the sudden swelling on their chests pushing out against bright elastic, tugging them forward along the streets of our neighborhood and into the rest of their lives. I knew that Ramona wanted to jog and see if her heart would push itself out while she was panting and sputtering. She\\u2019d have a bulge on her little chest then. Who cares if it was only on one side?  Imagine being with a boy, in a basement or a closet, and then that sudden beating on the outside of your chest. Imagine that he wouldn\\u2019t be grossed out at all. Imagine that he\\u2019d let out a moan, some unbelievable sound, because of the way your body was being right there in front of him. Ramona never confessed to any daydreams like that, but I knew she had them. I had them for her.\\n\\nI practically lived at Ramona\\u2019s house that summer. Almost every night I was stretched out there on her bed, waiting for sleep and feeling the humidity press into every part of me like a secret I figured someday I might identify and then maybe understand.\\n\\n\\u201cSee,\\u201d she said the first time she showed me. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like this.\\u201d\\n\\nRamona pulled her tank top up and there it was: a heart beating on the outside of her chest. I didn\\u2019t scream like I thought I would. I didn\\u2019t cover my eyes or gag or laugh uncontrollably. I just looked at it. I nodded my head. \\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said. And then I blinked or glanced at her face, and when I looked again it was already gone. She didn\\u2019t have her bra on. We had each bought the same size and the same style at the beginning of the summer, even though neither of us needed one yet. We hardly wore them when it was just the two of us lazing around her house, waiting for the world to happen. Ramona kept her tank top pulled up even after her heart had disappeared. I stared at her chest. It was creamy and bare and ordinary\\u2014no trace of the bloody, glistening muscle that had been galloping there only seconds before.\\n\\nI miss Ramona. It\\u2019s a simple kind of missing. It\\u2019s the way vague regret and longing pool in your stomach when you shouldn\\u2019t be feeling anything at all\\u2014while pulling laundry out of the washer, while walking the dog, while reaching for something in the shower with your eyes squeezed shut. The two of us were careless and let whatever we had dissolve into a leftover pang of almost-nostalgia. Who knows where she is now?\\n\\n\\u201cTurn your stomach inside out,\\u201d she said one night.\\n\\nI was almost asleep. I opened my eyes up to the dark.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI mean, for real,\\u201d she said. There was that mean, annoyed flip that sometimes came out at the ends of her sentences.\\n\\n\\u201cLike this,\\u201d she said. She turned on the little lamp next to her bed, and her heart was there again, beating and wet against the delicate V of her unbuttoned nightgown. The openings and valves and the whole mess of it sucked at the air like an angry, stranded fish.\\n\\nI think about that heart late at night, my husband pressed here in bed next to me. I try to reach back into my childhood and pin lanky, eleven-year-old Ramona with eating disorders and depression and the hungry, open mouth of loneliness. But really, it was just that thing with her heart. That\\u2019s all. And I\\u2019m jealous. I still do it\\u2014lie here in bed and try to push things outside of myself. I\\u2019m jealous of any woman who has ever given birth. Think of it\\u2014something being forced out like that, gravity or fate or whatever it is pulling away at you like a stubborn, certain thing.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The narrator and her friend, Ramona, spend the summer together, waiting for something exciting to happen.

The girls paint their toenails and discuss the possibility of Ramona's heart appearing while exercising.\\n\\nRamona shows the narrator what her heart looks like one night, exposing her chest and revealing her beating heart. The narrator reacts calmly, but feels a sense of longing and nostalgia for their friendship.\\n\\nYears later, the narrator reflects on her memories of Ramona and her heart.

Mama says so sometimes.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat is a witch?\\u201d I asked Mama once.\\n\\n\\u201cA witch is an unusual person. They are different from normal people,\\u201d Mama told me.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople call me different. Am I a witch too?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cIdara, you are not a witch, okay?!\\u201d Mama said. \\u201cYou are a kind and sweet little girl and when I\\u2019m done with you, you will be a strong, independent woman,\\u201d she told me, holding my arms as she looked into my eyes, smiling. I smiled too.\\n\\n\\u201cA witch can never be these things,\\u201d she said. \\u201cA witch is a paranormal creature that lives between the shadows cast by daylight. They traverse the infinities of a heartbeat, they sail in seas of dreams\\u2026 they manipulate nature.\\u201d\\n\\nI couldn\\u2019t understand Mama. It seemed to me that witches did wonderful things.\\n\\n\\u201cAbove all else, a witch is evil. Evil for a witch is its own reward,\\u201d she finished. I knew it must be true because Mama never lied.\\n\\nI wondered if Aunty Adesuwa was all these things. I think it was that day my hatred for witches began to take root. I hated how they perverted a thing that would otherwise have been beautiful. I didn\\u2019t know why Mama or anyone hadn\\u2019t stopped Aunty Adesuwa and I didn\\u2019t care to know. I would stop her myself.\\n\\nI once saw Aunty Adesuwa eavesdropping on my mother and two of her friends. I didn\\u2019t know how to signal Mama without her seeing me. My palms became sweaty and my breathing difficult.\\n\\n\\u201cWe all know Adesuwa killed her ex-husband\\u2019s illegitimate child,\\u201d Aunty Bisi, one of Mama\\u2019s friends said. She probably thought she was whispering. She wasn\\u2019t. Aunty Bisi always complained about my clothing to my mom. She had a big nose. I didn\\u2019t like her. As I stood paralyzed by fear, Aunty Adesuwa burst into the meeting. She was all tears and fury.\\n\\n\\u201cI loved that child!\\u201d she screamed. Mama and her friends stared open-mouthed at her.\\n\\n\\u201cAm I the cancer that afflicted him?\\u201d she asked. \\u201cYou\\u2019re all typical weak women! You judge me for leaving a man who was perpetually unfaithful. You judge me for doing well for myself without his help. You blame me for his misfortunes. You blame me for the death of a child whom I loved regardless of the manner of his conception.\\u201d\\n\\nWhile she talked I felt it resonating in my bones. My blood seemed to heat up in my veins as if her words scorched my insides. I wondered if Mama and her friends felt this strangeness. They didn\\u2019t seem to.\\n\\n\\u201cGod will judge all of you\\u201d Aunty Adesuwa said finally, walking away. Days later, I still pondered her words.\\n\\nIt was a sunny day, two weeks after Aunty Adesuwa\\u2019s tirade. I hid in the bushes by her house. Aunty Bisi had come down with a fever. Mama had sent me to give her and her big nose the medicinal pepper soup. I had subliminally taken a route that went past Aunty Adesuwa\\u2019s house when I saw her calling to a teenage boy. He was new in the village. His bicycle seemed worn out. I watched as she offered him a steaming plate of jollof rice and chilled Fanta. I saw a grin split his face. Generally, we were not very hospitable to strangers in our village. Even Mama was downright awful to them. I pondered this as I went to give Aunty Big Nose her pepper soup.\\n\\nThree weeks later I sneaked out of my house at midnight. Mama was sleeping like a log. She had been helping her only friend other than Aunty Bisi, Aunty Uwa with the burial of her son. He had accidently ridden his bicycle off a cliff the day he came visiting from the neighboring village. I wish I had known him.\\n\\nI walked to Aunty Adesuwa\\u2019s house. I had to see the witch in her element. It still pained me that such a fascinating and wondrous thing as magic was used for evil. I hid in the darkness watching aunty Adesuwa\\u2019s house. It was hours before I heard her back door opening. I ran on tip toes to the backyard. I saw Aunty Adesuwa, naked as her name day, striding into the forest. I followed her. It was a long walk. Finally she stepped into a moonlit clearing. As I watched her, I felt a migraine that blurred my sight. In the place where Aunty Adesuwa should have been, there was instead the body of a very large cat with her head still human. Her glowing eyes were looking right at my hidden position in the bushes.\\n\\n\\u201cIdara,\\u201d she hissed.\\n\\nMy heart pounded violently. My whole body shook with trepidation. I steadied myself as best as I could and stepped out with Mama\\u2019s kitchen knife clutched in my trembling hands.\\n\\n\\u201cI hate you,\\u201d I said.\\n\\n\\u201cWhy?\\u201d she purred innocently.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Cause you\\u2019re evil,\\u201d I said.\\n\\n\\u201cAre you certain?\\u201d she asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said, nodding to myself. Mama had told me witches were evil. She had also said Aunty Adesuwa was a witch. Therefore, Aunty Adesuwa was evil.\\n\\n\\u201cI know you\\u2019ve been watching, Idara. Your mother taught you better than to jump to conclusions,\\u201d she chided.\\n\\n\\u201cConsider the facts,\\u201d she said. It was something Mama always said to me that helped me solve riddles.\\n\\n\\u201cThe riddle of witches?\\u201d I asked\\n\\n\\u201dThe riddle of my witchcraft,\\u201d she replied.\\n\\nI pondered thoughts I had kept in the deep recesses of my mind. I was sure witches were evil because Mama never lied. I was sure Aunty Adesuwa was a witch after seeing her transformation but was I sure Aunty Adesuwa was evil?\\n\\nAunty Adesuwa had been kind and sweet to the stranger with the bicycle. She had loved her stepson. She had also shown her strength and independence by leaving her cheating husband and thriving without him. She was also a witch. This was my confusion.\\n\\nMama said a witch could never be these things.\\n\\n\\u201cThings not adding up, yes?\\u201d she asked, amused by my consternation.\\n\\nIt hit me. Aunty Adesuwa must be a good witch. They actually existed! The realization rekindled a forgotten hope of mine.\\n\\n\\u201cWill you teach me to be a good witch like you?\\u201d I asked her.\\n\\nShe purred contentedly. She seemed to have anticipated my response. I suppose I should have been scared. I wasn\\u2019t.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, sweet child. I will teach you to be a witch\\u2026 just like me,\\u201d she said, her tail swinging leisurely behind her.\\n\\n\\u201cThank you, Aunty,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nShe stalked away into the deep foliage gesturing me to follow with her tail.\\n\\nAs I followed, I thought of Mama. Mama never lied but she was human. She could make mistakes. She didn\\u2019t know about good witches. I thought about how I would make her proud. I would show her the beauty I had only ever seen in my sea of dreams.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story revolves around a young girl named Idara who believes her Aunt Adesuwa is a witch because her mother insists on it sometimes.

Frightened, Idara steps forward with a kitchen knife and proclaims her hatred for Aunt Adesuwa because she is evil.\\n\\nAunt Adesuwa questions Idara's certainty and asks her to consider the facts. Confused and conflicted, Idara reflects on Aunt Adesuwa's past actions, such as being kind and sweet to a stranger and loving her stepson. These actions contradict the idea that witches are evil, leading Idara to realize that Aunt Adesuwa may be a good witch.\\n\\nIdara eagerly asks Aunt Adesuwa to teach her to be a good witch like her.

We\\u2014that is, the board and I\\u2014have poured over every possible budgetary alteration, and we just can\\u2019t conceive of a scenario in which retaining your services makes logistical sense. All the research we\\u2019ve conducted behind your back over the last three years suggests that the position of chief executive officer for our multi-billion dollar corporation can be more efficiently performed by a robot.\\n\\nEffective immediately, you have been relieved of your duties. ROB-X164, seated to your left, will be sworn in as your replacement, with a formal announcement coming this afternoon. While we\\u2019re sure this is quite a shock to you right now, we do believe that in time you will accept that this decision is in the best interest of the company.\\n\\nIn your present state of fury, you\\u2019re probably wondering, \\u201cWhat makes ROB so special?\\u201d The short answer? Everything. We see in ROB a more personable, less error-prone version of you.

What we\\u2019re talking about here is someone who can guide this company to unscaled heights, not to mention its first corporate league softball championship in thirteen years.\\n\\nROB has proven himself to be quite the workaholic. It\\u2019s a never-ending cycle of productivity with this guy\\u2014there\\u2019s no taking off for sick days, vacation, or even sleep. There\\u2019s also no division of commitment to worry about.

Let\\u2019s say he wanted to make love to your wife, which he most certainly does not, as he\\u2019s completely devoid of sexual desire, but if he did, he could do so in one quarter of the time it takes you, with half the effort and twice the vigor, eliciting sixty-four times the sexual satisfaction. Factoring in your age, heart rate, and penis size, as well as that new Facebook pic of your wife in compression shorts, ROB arrived at these figures in 3.7 seconds, or, approximately the amount of time it takes you to react to the most vanilla softball pitch imaginable.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re still not convinced of ROB\\u2019s utter superiority in every conceivable facet, take a gander at these visual aids:\\n\\n* Here\\u2019s a photo of ROB shaking hands with a prominent shareholder.

I\\u2019m certain her original homework was wrong because she copied off of mine and I\\u2019m an algebraic head case. Billy Maguire\\u2019s a goon, but Billy Maguire is also the smartest kid in the seventh grade. That\\u2019s how I know life isn\\u2019t fair. Lola folds Maguire\\u2019s offering into her training bra and plops down next to him. I taste this morning\\u2019s Cheerios backing up in my throat.\\n\\nTypical day now. Lola and Maguire are holding hands at the bus stop. It\\u2019s 7:45 AM, which makes it even grosser.\\n\\nMy best friend, Seegs, is obsessed with two things\\u2014Soldier of Fortune 3 and sex. He points at Lola and Maguire. \\u201cHow far do you think they\\u2019ve gone?\\u201d\\n\\nI think about decking Seegs, but he\\u2019s a compulsive nose bleeder.

He knows practically nothing, but his brother told him stuff and he\\u2019s at State College. It\\u2019s sick to think about Maguire, his monster lips and hands oozing over my sister. Or maybe more.

We didn\\u2019t know each other. We took her car and headed to Missouri from Chicago. I remember that by the time we\\u2019d gone a few miles south on the Stevenson we\\u2019d already run out of things to say. But, for some reason, we both decided, without spelling it out, not to push it. Nothing was going to come of this, of us, we had hours to go, and it was all right just to let the silence be and listen to the radio. We were on our way to a s\\u00e9ance she\\u2019d heard about from an old high-school friend. She\\u2019d grown up in a small town southwest of St. Louis, and the s\\u00e9ance was being held nearby, at an abandoned air-force base.\\n\\nWe\\u2019d met a couple of nights before. Beth had come into the restaurant near the Loop where I waited tables, and had written her number on a napkin. \\u201cCall me,\\u201d she\\u2019d ordered. A couple of nights later, over drinks, she told me that she wasn\\u2019t the kind of person who ordered people to call her. Something about my face had said that I needed to be told what to do. That was also when she mentioned that this s\\u00e9ance was happening at 2:00 A.M. near St. Louis. If we left right away, she said, we could probably make it. The fact that we both had to be at work the next day made it all the more spontaneous and awesome. We headed out into the night exalted, until, like I said, our conversation dried up completely. It was as if the intrepid adventure were already over and now we just had a shitlong ride ahead of us, which we did.\\n\\nWhen I woke up, we were already past St. Louis and Beth had turned off onto a narrow two-lane highway that cut through a forest. We drove another hour and a half before we reached the base. As per her friend\\u2019s instructions, we ditched the car beneath a stand of trees. Beth didn\\u2019t need any help climbing the fence. She practically leapt over it, and I had to sprint to catch up with her as she strode along the ghost streets, past rows of empty barracks.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the hurry?\\u201d I said. \\u201cEverybody\\u2019s already dead.\\u201d No answer. When we got to Hangar 32, the s\\u00e9ance had already begun. About a dozen people were standing in a circle holding hands. At the center of the circle was a flower pot. Two people unclasped their hands to allow Beth and me to join. A bearded guy in a black watch cap was mumbling with authority. I admit that at first I found the whole thing mesmerizing. Coming upon this group in the darkness of that enormous hangar, the man chanting, the single flame flowing shadows onto the corrugated walls. There was something weirdly sacred about it all, and I thought, Right, if you want to commune with the dead, of course what you have to do is drive across the night to Missouri.\\n\\nBut, after half an hour, forty-five minutes, I began to understand just how fucking cold I was. It was mid-March and I hadn\\u2019t dressed for it. You want to dress lightly on a first date to demonstrate how free and easy-going you are. The dude was still mumbling, and I waited for something, anything, to happen, while softly stamping my feet on the crumbling pavement to warm them up. I was about to whisper to Beth, whose hand I was holding, \\u201cYo, why don\\u2019t we blow this popsicle stand and get some fucking breakfast?,\\u201d when somebody new began shouting. \\u201cMarina? Is that you, Marina?\\u201d Then other people were speaking, too. \\u201cLarry, tell your sister I\\u2019m onto her games.\\u201d \\u201cHow many years did you think you could hide in plain sight, Ramon?\\u201d Even Beth got into it: \\u201cYou never loved me, not a day, not an hour, not a second of a single minute\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nEverybody was speaking at once, and I had trouble discerning individual words in the chaos of voices. And it was ridiculous, it was beyond ridiculous, but it also wasn\\u2019t ridiculous. Shouts in the dark. Maybe that\\u2019s the best we can do to reach beyond ourselves. I tried to join in, too, but I could sense none of my dead, and I couldn\\u2019t, for the life of me, think of anything to just spout out. So I bought it, but at the same time, by that point, I was just trying to live through it, I was so cold. Then the candle went out and our leader broke ranks and swooped down to relight it, but his lighter jammed. We all stopped speaking and began patting down our pockets for a lighter or matches. But our leader shouted at us, \\u201cNo! Don\\u2019t break the membrane! Re-bond!\\u201d\\n\\nWe never quite got back on track after that. The collective spirit or belief or whatever it was escaped from us, and, though our leader mumbled for another half an hour, only a few people spoke up. The guy next to me, a guy I\\u2019d been holding hands with for almost two hours without getting a look at his face, actually made a joke. At least, I thought it was a joke. He said something about the temperature of coffee in hell. I laughed out loud. No one else did. That pretty much ended it. Before we left, Beth went up to the leader and gave him a kiss on the lips that wasn\\u2019t a friend\\u2019s kiss, not by a long stretch. In the car, I asked her who she\\u2019d reached. She said she didn\\u2019t want to talk about it.\\n\\n\\u201cSo you and the dude\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat was nothing. O.K.?\\u201d\\n\\nWe settled back into the silence of the drive. No radio now, just the drone of the engine, which you don\\u2019t hear unless you listen for it, and then it\\u2019s there all the time. It was getting toward dawn, and the dark was giving way to gray. I\\u2019ve always loved that early-morning gloom. I was about to say as much, to try to chip away at the silence, when I noticed that the car had begun to drift into the oncoming lane. Beth had fallen asleep. I don\\u2019t know why but, instead of grabbing the wheel, I seized her shoulder. She woke up but didn\\u2019t seem to realize what was happening and immediately stomped on the brakes. We jolted forward, skidded, and stopped. Headlights were approaching out of the gray. I had time for only one thing. I opened my door, got out, ran off the road into the trees, and waited for the headlights to slam into Beth.\\n\\nThey didn\\u2019t. The other driver saw her in time and fishtailed around her and stopped. For a few moments, everything was still. Then I heard the birds in the trees. I walked back out to the road. The guy rolled down the window of his truck. He looked at Beth in her car; he looked at me. Then he drove away, as if some lovers\\u2019 spat weren\\u2019t worth anything he might have mustered up to say. My door was still open. Beth was calm, motionless, her hands still gripping the wheel.\\n\\nWhen something happens, for better or for worse it\\u2019s happened. It has a before. It has an after. Maybe you can talk about it. Maybe you can\\u2019t. But what about something that almost happens? What almost happens repeats itself. I\\u2019ve come to believe this as a kind of personal gospel.

Whenever children use blue paint, tiny particles of it dissolve from their hands into the air and color it blue.  Over time the pigment fades, but as long as there is fingerpainting, there will always be blue sky.\\n\\nAnother answer is related to the blue-eyed creatures at the North and South Poles.  They are always looking up into the sky, and the blue of their eyes reflects back for the whole world to see.  You\\u2019ve probably never heard of these polar creatures because they know how to hide from satellites and explorers.  The reflection of their eyes is all we\\u2019ll ever see of them.\\n\\nBut the answer I think is true right now concerns angels and blueberries. \\n\\nYou see, blueberries are the angels\\u2019 favorite food.  There\\u2019s nothing they like more; and berries are healthy, so it\\u2019s a happy coincidence.  The only problem is, angels are sloppy eaters, and they eat pretty much all day. Of course they do other things like play the harp and sing and keep little babies from getting into the bleach under the sink. But they still have lots of time to munch on blueberries\\u2014they live forever, after all\\u2014so little bits of blueberry wind up all over the sky.\\n\\nEven worse, some angels don\\u2019t like the blueberry skins, so they peel each berry before eating it and toss the skins to the side.  This doesn\\u2019t make them blatant litterers, mind you\\u2014they know they\\u2019ll get around to picking up the skins, just not at that very moment.\\n\\nSo as the day goes on, the angels eat more and more berries; and as the sun goes down, its light reflects through the berry pulp and juice, creating wonderful reds and oranges and yellows.  And still the angels eat, and the sky grows darker and darker with blue skins and bits of berry.  The angels keep on munching until, with the exception of little gaps for the moon and stars, no light can get to the Earth at all.  In fact, there\\u2019s not even enough room for the moon most of the time, which is why you only see the whole thing once a month.\\n\\nIn the middle of the night God finally has enough, and she tells the angels they have to start cleaning up their mess.  Of course they start right away, but it\\u2019s a big mess and it takes a while.  And as they clean, you can see a little bits of light start to penetrate the layer of blueberry waste.  Dawn begins as they wipe and scrub, and daylight breaks when they finally clear away enough blueberries for the sun to shine on the Earth again. \\n\\nThe one problem is that blueberry skins stain, and the angels can\\u2019t scrub the traces away completely.  Some days they do better, and the sky is light blue.  But on very sunny days you can see the full extent of the staining and the sky is a rich, dark blue.  But God isn\\u2019t that concerned about the stains.  She actually thinks they\\u2019re pretty, and the renters down on the surface don\\u2019t mind, and she\\u2019s not planning on moving anytime soon, so it\\u2019s not like she has to worry about resale value.  What matters to her is that the angels did their best.\\n\\nNow, you may wonder what would happen if the angels ever got tired of blueberries.  What would happen if they switched to raspberries?  Would the sky eventually wind up purple?  If they started eating bananas, would the yellow peels turn the blue sky green?  Or if they developed a fondness for lemons, would the juice bleach the color out forever?  And if that happened, would your grandchildren ever believe the sky had once been blue? \\n\\nOr would they just think you were a silly writer telling stories about angels and blueberries?\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story is a whimsical and imaginative explanation of why the sky is blue. The narrator presents multiple fantastical explanations, each with its own unique twist.\\n\\nFirstly, the narrator suggests that the blue color of the sky comes from the particles of blue fingerpaint that children dissolve into the air when they use it. This idea implies that as long as there is fingerpainting, the sky will always be blue.\\n\\nNext, the narrator introduces the concept of blue-eyed creatures at the North and South Poles. These creatures constantly look up at the sky, and the blue reflection from their eyes is what gives the sky its color. These creatures are said to be elusive and skilled at hiding from satellites and explorers.\\n\\nThe third explanation revolves around angels and blueberries. The narrator claims that blueberries are the favorite food of angels. However, angels are messy eaters, and as they eat blueberries all day, tiny bits of the fruit end up in the sky. The angels also discard the berry skins, which contributes to the blue mess in the sky. When the sky becomes dark with blueberry remnants, God commands the angels to clean up their mess. As they scrub away the blueberry waste, bits of light start to penetrate the sky, and dawn breaks when enough blueberries are cleared for the sun to shine on the Earth again.\\n\\nThe story emphasizes that despite the stains left behind by blueberry skins, God finds them beautiful and does not mind the marks on the sky. The narrator poses the question of what would happen if the angels decided to eat something other than blueberries, implying that the sky's color could potentially change based on their food preferences. However, these further explanations are left to the imagination.\\n\\nThroughout the story, the narrator suggests that different people may have different answers to why the sky is blue, depending on their perspective or creativity. The story encourages a sense of wonder and imagination, leaving the readers to contemplate their own interpretations of the sky.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"In this whimsical and imaginative story, the narrator provides various answers to the question of why the sky is blue. The answers range from scientific explanations to creative explanations involving fictional creatures and objects. Each response represents a different approach and perspective. \\n\\nThe story starts by acknowledging that an adult's answer to the question is scientific and technical, explaining how light interacts with air particles to create the color blue. The narrative then transitions into imaginative responses. First, it suggests that the color blue in the sky comes from the particles of blue fingerpaint that dissolve into the air when children use it. This theory claims that the constant fingerpainting of children always ensures a blue sky.\\n\\nThe narrative further expresses that the skies could be blue because of blue-eyed creatures living at the poles. These creatures remain hidden from human explorers and spy satellites, but their blue eyes contribute to the sky's color. They act as mirrors, reflecting the blue of their eyes into the atmosphere.\\n\\nTowards the end, the story's conclusion settles on the idea that the blueberries angels consume creates the blue hue of the atmospheric sky. The angels, who are attributed with various duties, enjoy snacking on blueberries throughout eternity. As they eat, stray bits of blueberry go all over the sky; their purple juice creates the warm tones seen during sunset. Eventually, their meal debris becomes so extensive that it obstructs any light reaching the Earth, resulting in nighttime.\\n\\nGod, seeing enough of this mess, instructs the angels to clean up. Thus, they tirelessly scrub and wipe away the blueberry remnants, allowing daylight to reemerge for humans to enjoy once again. They cannot, however, removed all the stains, leading to variations in the appearance of the sky, depending on the sunlight. God, unconcerned about the staining, appreciates their effort and the beauty it brings to the sky.\\n\\nThe story concludes by playfully pondering about potential scenarios in which the angels switch their fruit preference, humorously speculating how different fruits might alter the sky's color. Ultimately, the story leaves readers with the question of whether individuals who hear and believe these stories and explanations might be seen as silly storytellers themselves.\", \"story_token_count\": 1087, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 470, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 529}, {\"Title\": \"BABY DOLLS\", \"Author\": \"Becky Robison\", \"story\": \"My mother isn\\u2019t always Raggedy Ann, but she was when I was born.

They explain that she is not always like this, but she was when they were born. The narrator recounts a Halloween office party that took place in Richard Nixon's basement apartment. Their mother, dressed as Raggedy Ann, sipped on Shirley Temples while the narrator's fists pummeled her beneath her thrift-store jumper.\\n\\nThe narrator expresses their dislike for grenadine, the sweet syrup in the Shirley Temples, but understands that Raggedy Ann, being a doll, would not know this.

It is hinted that their mother may not have been in her right mind due to being under the influence of drugs or alcohol when she became pregnant. The story then revolves around a Halloween office party that took place at Richard Nixon's basement apartment.\\n\\nAt the party, the narrator's mother is depicted as a young woman, dressed as Raggedy Ann, and partakes in indulgent behavior by occasionally drinking Shirley Temples. Meanwhile, the narrator describes the strangeness of their early existence as they communicate with their jelly-like fists from within their mother's womb during the event. The narrator also inadvertently dislikes the taste of grenadine, which is present in the Shirley Temples.\\n\\nThe party guests, presumably intoxicated or under the influence, engage in lively and chaotic behavior causing amusement. As a result, when the mother's water breaks and dampens her striped stockings, the raucous laughter fills the room, including the mother joining in on the lighthearted response to the situation.\\n\\nFollowing this, a cat who seemingly possesses a disproportionately long tail to the length of the mother's skirt appears and carries the doll-like Raggedy Ann figure into the bathroom, shutting the moldy curtain on them both.

B\\u2019lieve it all you wants tuh, but dontcha tell mah son none of it.\\u201d\\n\\nPerhaps ten-year-old John was puzzling to the simple folk there in the Florida woods for he was an imaginative child and fond of day-dreams. The St. John River flowed a scarce three hundred feet from his back door. On its banks at this point grow numerous palms, luxuriant magnolias and bay trees with a dense undergrowth of ferns, cat-tails and rope-grass. On the bosom of the stream float millions of delicately colored hyacinths. The little brown boy loved to wander down to the water\\u2019s edge, and, casting in dry twigs, watch them sail away down stream to Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world and John Redding wanted to follow them.\\n\\nSometimes in his dreams he was a prince, riding away in a gorgeous carriage. Often he was a knight bestride a fiery charger prancing down the white shell road that led to distant lands. At other times he was a steamboat captain piloting his craft down the St. John River to where the sky seemed to touch the water. No matter what he dreamed or who he fancied himself to be, he always ended by riding away to the horizon; for in his childish ignorance he thought this to be farthest land.\\n\\nBut these twigs, which John called his ships, did not always sail away. Sometimes they would be swept in among the weeds growing in the shallow water, and be held there. One day his father came upon him scolding the weeds for stopping his sea-going vessels.\\n\\n\\u201cLet go mah ships! You ole mean weeds you!\\u201d John screamed and stamped impotently. \\u201cThey wants tuh go \\u2019way.

She was a small wiry woman with large eyes that might have been beautiful when she was young, but too much weeping had left them watery and weak.\\n\\n\\u201cMatty,\\u201d Alf began as he took his place at the table, \\u201cdontcha know our boy is different from any othah chile roun\\u2019 heah.

He kain\\u2019t help wantin\\u2019 tuh go cause he\\u2019s a man chile!\\u201d\\n\\nMrs. Redding promptly went off into a fit of weeping but the man and boy ate supper unmoved. Twelve years of married life had taught Alfred that far from being miserable when she wept, his wife was enjoying a bit of self-pity.\\n\\nThus John Redding grew to manhood, playing, studying and dreaming. He attended the village school as did most of the youth about him, but he also went to high school at the county seat where none of the villagers went. His father shared his dreams and ambitions, but his mother could not understand why he should wish to go strange places where neither she nor his father had been. No one of their community had ever been farther away than Jacksonville. Few indeed had ever been there. Their own gardens, general store, and occasional trips to the county seat\\u2014seven miles away\\u2014sufficed for all their needs. Life was simple indeed with these folk.\\n\\nJohn was the subject of much discussion among the country folk. Why didn\\u2019t he teach school instead of thinking about strange places and people? Did he think himself better than any of the \\u201cgals\\u201d there about that he would not go a-courting any of them? He must be \\u201cfixed\\u201d as his mother claimed, else where did his queer notions come from? Well, he was always queer, and one could not expect the man to be different from the child. They never failed to stop work at the approach of Alfred in order to be at the fence and inquire after John\\u2019s health and ask when he expected to leave.\\n\\n\\u201cOh,\\u201d Alfred would answer. \\u201cJes\\u2019 as soon as his mah gits reconciled to th\\u2019 notion. He\\u2019s a mighty dutiful boy, mah John is. He doan wanna hurt her feelings.\\u201d\\n\\nThe boy had on several occasions attempted to reconcile his mother to the notion, but found it a difficult task. Matty always took refuge in self-pity and tears. Her son\\u2019s desires were incomprehensible to her, that was all. She did not want to hurt him. It was love, mother love, that made her cling so desperately to John.\\n\\n\\u201cLawd knows,\\u201d she would sigh, \\u201cAh nevah wuz happy an\\u2019 nevah specks tuh be.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAn\\u2019 from yo\\u2019 actions,\\u201d put in Alfred hotly, \\u201cyou\\u2019s determined not to be.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThas right, Alfred, go on an\\u2019 \\u2019buse me. You allus does. Ah knows Ah\\u2019m ign\\u2019rant an\\u2019 all dat, but dis is mah son. Ah bred an\\u2019 born \\u2019im. He kain\\u2019t help from wantin\\u2019 to go rovin\\u2019 cause travel dust been put down fuh him. But mebbe we kin cure \\u2019im by disincouragin\\u2019 the idee.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, Ah wants mah son tuh go; an\\u2019 he wants tuh go too. He\\u2019s a man now, Matty. An\\u2019 we mus\\u2019 let John hoe his own row. If it\\u2019s travelin\\u2019 twon\\u2019t be foh long. He\\u2019ll come back to us bettah than when he went off. What do you say, son?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMamma,\\u201d John began slowly, \\u201cit hurts me to see you so troubled over my going away; but I feel that I must go. I\\u2019m stagnating here. This indolent atmosphere will stifle every bit of ambition that\\u2019s in me. Let me go mamma, please. What is there here for me? Why, sometimes I get to feeling just like a lump of dirt turned over by the plow\\u2014just where it falls there\\u2019s where it lies\\u2014no thought or movement or nothing. I wanter make myself something\\u2014not just stay where I was born.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNaw, John, it\\u2019s bettah for you to stay heah and take over the school. Why don\\u2019t you marry and settle down?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to, mamma. I want to go away.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell,\\u201d said Mrs. Redding, pursing her mouth tightly, \\u201cyou ainta goin\\u2019 wid mah consent!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry mamma, that you won\\u2019t consent. I am going nevertheless.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJohn, John, mah baby! You wouldn\\u2019t kill yo\\u2019 po\\u2019 ole mamma, would you? Come, kiss me, son.\\u201d\\n\\nThe boy flung his arms about his mother and held her closely while she sobbed on his breast. To all of her pleas, however, he answered that he must go.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ll stay at home this year, mamma, then I\\u2019ll go for a while, but it won\\u2019t be long. I\\u2019ll come back and make you and papa oh so happy. Do you agree, mamma dear?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh reckon tain\\u2019 nothin\\u2019 tall fuh me to do else.\\u201d\\n\\nThings went on very well around the Redding home for some time. During the day John helped his father about the farm and read a great deal at night.\\n\\nThen the unexpected happened. John married Stella Kanty, a neighbor\\u2019s daughter. The courtship was brief but ardent\\u2014on John\\u2019s part at least. He danced with Stella at a candy-pulling, walked with her home and in three weeks had declared himself. Mrs. Redding declared that she was happier than she had ever been in her life. She therefore indulged in a whole afternoon of weeping. John\\u2019s change was occasioned possibly by the fact that Stella was really beautiful; he was young and red-blooded, and the time was spring.\\n\\nSpring-time in Florida is not a matter of peeping violets or bursting buds merely. It is a riot of color in nature\\u2014glistening green leaves, pink, blue, purple, yellow blossoms that fairly stagger the visitor from the north. The miles of hyacinths lie like an undulating carpet on the surface of the river and divide reluctantly when the slow-moving alligators push their way log-like across. The nights are white nights for the moon shines with dazzling splendor, or in the absence of that goddess, the soft darkness creeps down laden with innumerable scents. The heavy fragrance of magnolias mingled with the delicate sweetness of jasmine and wild roses.\\n\\nIf time and propinquity conquered John, what then? These forces have overcome older men.\\n\\nThe raptures of the first few weeks over, John began to saunter out to the gate to gaze wistfully down the white dusty road; or to wander again to the river as he had done in childhood. To be sure he did not send forth twig-ships any longer, but his thoughts would in spite of himself, stray down river to Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world\\u2014and poor home-tied John Redding wanted to follow them.\\n\\nHe grew silent and pensive. Matty accounted for this by her ever-ready explanation of \\u201cconjuration.\\u201d Alfred said nothing but smoked and puttered about the barn more than ever. Stella accused her husband of indifference and made his life miserable with tears, accusations and pouting. At last John decided to bring matters to a head and broached the subject to his wife.\\n\\n\\u201cStella, dear, I want to go roving about the world for a spell. Would you stay here with papa and mamma and wait for me to come back?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJohn, is you crazy sho\\u2019 nuff? If you don\\u2019t want me, say so an\\u2019 I kin go home to mah folks.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStella, darling, I do want you, but I want to go away too. I can have both if you\\u2019ll let me. We\\u2019ll be so happy when I return . . .\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNaw, John, you kain\\u2019t rush me off one side like that. You didn\\u2019t hafta marry me. There\\u2019s a plenty othahs that would have been glad enuff tuh get me; you know Ah wan\\u2019t educated befo\\u2019 han\\u2019.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t make me too conscious of my weakness, Stella. I know I should never have married with my inclinations, but it\\u2019s done now, no use to talk about what is past. I love you and want to keep you, but I can\\u2019t stifle that longing for the open road, rolling seas, for peoples and countries I have never seen. I\\u2019m suffering too, Stella, I\\u2019m paying for my rashness in marrying before I was ready. I\\u2019m not trying to shirk my duty\\u2014you\\u2019ll be well taken care of in the meanwhile.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJohn, folks allus said youse queer and tol\\u2019 me not to marry yuh, but Ah jes\\u2019 loved yuh so Ah couldn\\u2019t help it, an\\u2019 now to think you wants tuh sneak off an\\u2019 leave me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut I\\u2019m coming back, darling . . . listen Stella.\\u201d\\n\\nBut the girl would not. Matty came in and Stella fell into her arms weeping. John\\u2019s mother immediately took up arms against him. The two women carried on such an effective war against him for the next few days that finally Alfred was forced to take his son\\u2019s part.\\n\\n\\u201cMatty, let dat boy alone, Ah tell you! Ef he wuz uh homebuddy he\\u2019d be drove \\u2019way by you all\\u2019s racket.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, Alf, dat\\u2019s all we po\\u2019 wimmen kin do. We wants our husbands an\\u2019 our sons.

Let John walk off an\\u2019 leave huh?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNaw, git outer huh foolishness an\\u2019 go \\u2019long wid him. He\\u2019d take huh.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStella ain\\u2019t got no call tuh go crazy \\u2019cause John is. She ain\\u2019t no woman tuh be floppin\\u2019 roun\\u2019 from place tuh place lak some uh dese reps follerin\\u2019 uh section gang.\\u201d\\n\\nThe man turned abruptly from his wife and stood in the kitchen door. A blue haze hung over the river and Alfred\\u2019s attention seemed fixed upon this. In reality his thoughts were turned inward. He was thinking of the numerous occasions upon which he and his son had sat on the fallen log at the edge of the water and talked of John\\u2019s proposed travels. He had encouraged his son, given him every advantage his own poor circumstances would permit. And now John was home-tied.\\n\\nThe young man suddenly turned the corner of the house and approached his father.\\n\\n\\u201cHello, papa.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2019Lo, son.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere\\u2019s mamma and Stella?\\u201d\\n\\nThe older man merely jerked his thumb toward the interior of the house and once more gazed pensively toward the river. John entered the kitchen and kissed his mother fondly.\\n\\n\\u201cGreat news, mamma.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat now?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGot a chance to join the Navy, mamma, and go all around the world. Ain\\u2019t that grand?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJohn, you shorely ain\\u2019t gointer leave me an\\u2019 Stella, is yuh?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, I think I am. I know how both of you feel, but I know how I feel, also. You preach to me the gospel of self-sacrifice for the happiness of others, but you are unwilling to practice any of it yourself. Stella can stay here\\u2014I am going to support her and spend all the time I can with her. I am going\\u2014that\\u2019s settled, but I want to go with your good will. I want to do something worthy of a strong man. I have done nothing so far but look to you and papa for everything. Let me learn to strive and think\\u2014in short, be a man.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNaw, John, Ah\\u2019ll nevah give mah consent. I know yous hard-headed jes\\u2019 lak yo\\u2019 paw; but if you leave dis place ovah mah head, Ah nevah wants you tuh come back heah no mo. Ef Ah wuz laid on de coolin\\u2019 board, Ah doan want yuh standin\\u2019 ovah me, young man. Doan even come neah mah grave, you ongrateful wretch!\\u201d\\n\\nMrs. Redding arose and flung out of the room. For once, she was too incensed to cry. John stood in his tracks, gone cold and numb at his mother\\u2019s pronouncement. Alfred, too, was moved. Mrs. Redding banged the bed-room door violently and startled John slightly. Alfred took his son\\u2019s arm, saying softly: \\u201cCome, son, let\\u2019s go down to the river.\\u201d\\n\\nAt the water\\u2019s edge they halted for a short space before seating themselves on the log. The sun was setting in a purple cloud. Hundreds of mosquito hawks darted here and there, catching gnats and being themselves caught by the lightning-swift bullbats. John abstractly snapped in two the stalk of a slender young bamboo. Taking no note of what he was doing, he broke it into short lengths and tossed them singly into the stream. The old man watched him silently for a while, but finally he said: \\u201cOh, yes, my boy, some ships get tangled in the weeds.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, papa, they certainly do. I guess I\\u2019m beaten\\u2014might as well surrender.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNevah say die. Yuh nevah kin tell what will happen.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat can happen? I have courage enough to make things happen; but what can I do against mamma! What man wants to go on a long journey with his mother\\u2019s curses ringing in his ears? She doesn\\u2019t understand. I\\u2019ll wait another year, but I am going because I must.\\u201d\\n\\nAlfred threw an arm about his son\\u2019s neck and drew him nearer but quickly removed it. Both men instantly drew apart, ashamed for having been so demonstrative. The father looked off to the woodlot and asked with a reminiscent smile: \\u201cSon, do you remember showin\\u2019 me the tree dat looked lak a skeleton head?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, I do. It\\u2019s there still. I look at it sometimes when things have become too painful for me at the house, and I run down here to cool off and think. And every time I look at it, papa, it laughs at me like it had some grim joke up its sleeve.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYuh wuz always imaginin\\u2019 things, John; things that nobody else evah thought on!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou know, papa, sometimes\\u2014I reckon my longing to get away makes me feel this way. . . . I feel that I am just earth, soil lying helpless to move myself, but thinking. I seem to hear herds of big beasts like horses and cows thundering over me, and rains beating down; and winds sweeping furiously over\\u2014all acting upon me, but me, well, just soil, feeling but not able to take part in it all. Then a soft wind like love passes over and warms me, and a summer rain comes down like understanding and softens me, and I push a blade of grass or a flower, or maybe a pine tree\\u2014that\\u2019s the ground thinking. Plants are ground thoughts, because the soil can\\u2019t move itself. Whenever I see little whirls of dust sailing down the road I always step aside\\u2014don\\u2019t want to stop \\u2019em \\u2019cause they\\u2019re on their shining way\\u2014moving! Oh, yes, I\\u2019m a dreamer. . . . I have such wonderfully complete dreams, papa. They never come true. But even as my dreams fade I have others.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYas, son, Ah have them same feelings exactly, but Ah can\\u2019t find no words lak you do. It seems lak you an\\u2019 me see wid de same eyes, hear wid de same ears an\\u2019 even feel de same inside. Only thing you kin talk it an\\u2019 Ah can\\u2019t. But anyhow you speaks for me, so whut\\u2019s the difference?\\u201d\\n\\nThe men arose without more conversation. Possibly they feared to trust themselves to speech. As they walked leisurely toward the house Alfred remarked the freshness of the breeze.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s about time the rains set in,\\u201d added his son. \\u201cThe year is wearin\\u2019 on.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter a gloomy supper John strolled out into the spacious front yard and seated himself beneath a China-berry tree. The breeze had grown a trifle stronger since sunset and continued from the south-east. Matty and Stella sat on the deep front porch, but Alfred joined John under the tree. The family was divided into two armed camps and the hostilities had reached that stage where no quarter could be asked or given.\\n\\nAbout nine o\\u2019clock an automobile came flying down the dusty white road and halted at the gate. A white man slammed the gate and hurried up the walk toward the house, but stopped abruptly before the men beneath the China-berry. It was Mr. Hill, the builder of the new bridge that was to span the river.\\n\\n\\u201cHowdy John, Howdy Alf. I\\u2019m mighty glad I found you. I am in trouble.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell now, Mist\\u2019 Hill,\\u201d answered Alfred slowly but pleasantly. \\u201cWe\\u2019se glad you foun\\u2019 us too. What trouble could you be having now?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s the bridge. The weather bureau says that the rains will be upon me in forty-eight hours. If it catches the bridge as it is now, I\\u2019m afraid all my work of the past five months will be swept away, to say nothing of a quarter of a million dollars\\u2019 worth of labor and material. I\\u2019ve got all my men at work now and I thought to get as many extra hands as I could t0 help out tonight and tomorrow. We can make her weather tight in that time if I can get about twenty more.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ll go, Mister Hill,\\u201d said John with a great deal of energy. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want papa out on that bridge\\u2014too dangerous.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGood for you, John!\\u201d cried the white man. \\u201cNow if I had a few more men of your brawn and brain, I could build an entirely new bridge in forty-eight hours. Come on and jump into the car. I am taking the men on down as I find them.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWait a minute. I must put on my blue jeans. I won\\u2019t be long.\\u201d\\n\\nJohn arose and strode to the house. He knew that his mother and wife had overheard everything, but he paused for a moment to speak to them.\\n\\n\\u201cMamma, I am going to work all night on the bridge.\\u201d\\n\\nThere was no answer. He turned to his wife.\\n\\n\\u201cStella, don\\u2019t be lonesome. I will be home at day-break.\\u201d\\n\\nHis wife was as silent as his mother. John stood for a moment on the steps, then resolutely strode past the women and into the house. A few minutes later he emerged clad in his blue overalls and brogans. This time he said nothing to the silent figures rocking back and forth on the porch. But when he was a few feet from the steps he called back: \\u201cBye, mamma; bye, Stella,\\u201d and hurried on down the walk to where his father sat.\\n\\n\\u201cSo long, papa. I\\u2019ll be home around seven.\\u201d\\n\\nAlfred roused himself and stood. Placing both hands upon his son\\u2019s broad shoulders he said softly: \\u201cBe keerful son, don\\u2019t fall or nothin\\u2019.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI will, papa. Don\\u2019t you get into a quarrel on my account.\\u201d\\n\\nJohn hurried on to the waiting car and was whirled away.\\n\\nAlfred sat for a long time beneath the tree where his son had left him and smoked on. The women soon went indoors. On the night breeze were borne numerous scents: of jasmine, of roses, of damp earth of the river, of the pine forest near by. A solitary whip-poor-will sent forth his plaintive call from the nearby shrubbery. A giant owl roared and boomed from the woodlot. The calf confined in the barn would bleat and be answered by his mother\\u2019s sympathetic \\u201cmoo\\u201d from the pen. Away down in Lake Howell Creek the basso profundo of the alligators boomed and died, boomed and died.\\n\\nAround ten o\\u2019clock the breeze freshened, growing stiffer until midnight when it became a gale. Alfred fastened the doors and bolted the wooden shutters at the windows. The three persons sat about a round deal table in the kitchen upon which stood a bulky kerosene lamp, flickering and sputtering in the wind that came in through the numerous cracks in the walls. The wind rushed down the chimney blowing puffs of ashes about the room. It banged the cooking utensils on the walls. The drinking gourd hanging outside by the door played a weird tattoo, hollow and unearthly, against the thin wooden wall.\\n\\nThe man and the women sat silently. Even if there had been no storm they would not have talked. They could not go to bed because the women were afraid to retire during a storm and the man wished to stay awake and think with his son. Thus they sat: the women hot with resentment toward the man and terrified by the storm; the man hardly mindful of the tempest but eating his heart out in pity for his boy. Time wore heavily on.\\n\\nAnd now a new element of terror was added. A screech-owl alighted on the roof and shivered forth his doleful cry. Possibly he had been blown out of his nest by the wind. Matty started up at the sound but fell back in her chair, pale and trembling: \\u201cMy Gawd!\\u201d she gasped, \\u201cdat\\u2019s a sho\\u2019 sign uh death.\\u201d\\n\\nStella hurriedly thrust her hand into the salt-jar and threw some into the chimney of the lamp. The color of the flame changed from yellow to blue-green but this burning of salt did not have the desired effect\\u2014to drive away the bird from the roof. Matty slipped out of her blue calico wrapper and turned it wrong side out before replacing it. Even Alfred turned one sock.\\n\\n\\u201cAlf,\\u201d said Matty, \\u201cwhat do you reckon\\u2019s gonna happen from this?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow do Ah know, Matty?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh wisht John hadn\\u2019t went away from heah tuh night.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHumh.\\u201d\\n\\nOutside the tempest raged. The palms rattled dryly and the giant pines groaned and sighed in the grip of the wind. Flying leaves and pine-mast filled the air. Now and then a brilliant flash of lightning disclosed a bird being blown here and there with the wind. The prodigious roar of the thunder seemed to rock the earth. Black clouds hung so low that the tops of the pines were among them moving slowly before the wind and made the darkness awful. The screech-owl continued his tremulous cry.\\n\\nAfter three o\\u2019clock the wind ceased and the rain commenced. Huge drops clattered down upon the shingle roof like buckshot and ran from the eaves in torrents. It entered the house through the cracks in the walls and under the doors. It was a deluge in volume and force but subsided before morning.\\n\\nThe sun came up brightly on the havoc of the wind and rain calling forth millions of feathered creatures. The white sand everywhere was full of tiny cups dug out by the force of the falling raindrops. The rims of the little depressions crunched noisily underfoot.\\n\\nAt daybreak Mr. Redding set out for the bridge. He was uneasy. On arriving he found that the river had risen twelve feet during the cloudburst and was still rising. The slow St. John was swollen far beyond its banks and rushing on to sea like a mountain stream, sweeping away houses, great blocks of earth, cattle, trees\\u2014in short anything that came within its grasp. Even the steel framework of the new bridge was gone!\\n\\nThe siren of the fibre factory was tied down for half an hour, announcing the disaster to the country side. When Alfred arrived therefore he found nearly all the men of the district there.\\n\\nThe river, red and swollen, was full of floating debris. Huge trees were swept along as relentlessly as chicken coops and fence rails. Some steel piles were all that was left of the bridge.\\n\\nAlfred went down to a group of men who were fishing members of the ill-fated construction gang out of the water. Many were able to swim ashore unassisted. Wagons backed up and were hurriedly driven away loaded with wet shivering men. Two men had been killed outright, others seriously wounded. Three men had been drowned. At last all had been accounted for except John Redding. His father ran here and there asking for him, or calling him. No one knew where he was. No one remembered seeing him since daybreak.\\n\\nDozens of women had arrived at the scene of the disaster by this time. Matty and Stella, wrapped in woolen shawls, were among them. They rushed to Alfred in alarm and asked where was John.\\n\\n\\u201cAh doan know,\\u201d answered Alfred impatiently, \\u201cthat\\u2019s what Ah\\u2019m trying to fin\\u2019 out now.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDo you reckon he\\u2019s run away?\\u201d asked Stella thoughtlessly.\\n\\nMatty bristled instantly.\\n\\n\\u201cNaw,\\u201d she answered sternly, \\u201che ain\\u2019t no sneak.\\u201d\\n\\nThe father turned to Fred Mimms, one of the survivors and asked him where John was and how had the bridge been destroyed.\\n\\n\\u201cYuh see,\\u201d said Mimms, \\u201cwhen dat turrible win\\u2019 come up we wuz out \\u2019bout de middle of de river. Some of us wuz on de bridge, some on de derrick. De win\\u2019 blowed so hahd we could skeercely stan\\u2019 and Mist\\u2019 Hill tol\\u2019 us tuh set down fuh a spell. He\\u2019s \\u2019fraid some of us mought go overboard. Den all of a sudden de lights went out\\u2014guess de wires wuz blowed down. We wuz all skeered tuh move for slippin\\u2019 overboard. Den dat rain commenced\\u2014an\\u2019 Ah nevah seed such a down-pour since de flood. We set dere and someone begins tuh pray. Lawd how we did pray tuh be spared! Den somebody raised a song an\\u2019 we sung, you hear me, we sung from de bottom of our hearts till daybreak. When the first light come we couldn\\u2019t see nothin\\u2019 but fog everywhere. You couldn\\u2019t tell which wuz water an\\u2019 which wuz lan\\u2019. But when de sun come up de fog begin to liff, an\\u2019 we could see de water. Dat fog wuz so thick an\\u2019 heavy dat it wuz huggin\\u2019 dat river lak a windin\\u2019 sheet. And when it rose we saw dat de river had rose way up durin\\u2019 the rain. My Gawd, Alf! it wuz runnin\\u2019 high\\u2014so high it nearly teched de span of de bridge\\u2014an\\u2019 red as blood! So much clay, you know from lan\\u2019 she done overflowed. Comin\\u2019 down stream, as fas\\u2019 as \\u2019press train wuz three big pine trees. De first one wuzn\\u2019t fohty feet from us and there wasn\\u2019t no chance to do nothin\\u2019 but pray. De fust one struck us and shook de whole works an\\u2019 befo\\u2019 it could stop shakin\\u2019 the other two hit us an\\u2019 down we went. Ah thought Ah\\u2019d never see home again.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut, Mimms, where\\u2019s John?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh ain\\u2019t seen him, Alf, since de logs struck us. Mebbe he\\u2019s swum ashore, mebbe dey picked him up. What\\u2019s dat floatin\\u2019 way out dere in de water?\\u201d\\n\\nAlfred shaded his eyes with his gnarled brown hand and gazed out into the stream. Sure enough there was a man floating on a piece of timber. He lay prone upon his back. His arms were outstretched, and the water washed over his brogans but his feet were lifted out of the water whenever the timber was buoyed up by the stream. His blue overalls were nearly torn from his body. A heavy piece of steel or timber had struck him in falling for his left side was laid open by the thrust. A great jagged hole wherein the double fists of a man might be thrust, could plainly be seen from the shore. The man was John Redding.\\n\\nEveryone seemed to see him at once. Stella fell to the wet earth in a faint. Matty clung to her husband\\u2019s arm, weeping hysterically. Alfred stood very erect with his wife clinging tearfully to him, but he said nothing. A single tear hung on his lashes for a time then trickled slowly down his wrinkled brown cheek.\\n\\n\\u201cAlf! Alf!\\u201d screamed Matty, \\u201cdere\\u2019s our son. Ah knowed when Ah heard dat owl las\\u2019 night. . . .\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh see \\u2019im, Matty,\\u201d returned her husband softly.\\n\\n\\u201cWhy is yuh standin\\u2019 heah? Go git mah boy.\\u201d\\n\\nThe men were manning a boat to rescue the remains of John Redding when Alfred spoke again.\\n\\n\\u201cMah po\\u2019 boy, his dreams never come true.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAlf,\\u201d complained Matty, \\u201cwhy doantcher hurry an\\u2019 git my boy\\u2014doantcher see he\\u2019s floatin\\u2019 on off?\\u201d\\n\\nHer husband paid her no attention but addressed himself to the rescue-party.\\n\\n\\u201cYou all stop! Leave my boy go on. Doan stop \\u2019im. Doan\\u2019 bring \\u2019im back for dat ole tree to grin at. Leave him g\\u2019wan. He wants tuh go.

I was lying bare-chested in bed, rubbing some gunk from the corner of my right eye. It must have collected while I was sleeping, and to just let it stay there seemed inappropriate. Meanwhile, my left eye was idle, so I gave it the job of looking at my pants. I had taken them off the night before, and now I regretted tossing them so casually over the chair, where they lay wrinkled and crumpled beside my jacket. As my left eye inspected them, I began to wonder whether while sleeping I had shed, snakelike, a layer of skin, for that\\u2019s what my jacket and pants looked like. At this point, a drop of sunshine reached my pant leg; the little splotch of leaping light made me think of a golden flea. And so I felt itchy all over and had my idle left hand make itself useful by scratching.\\n\\nSomeone was knocking on the door.\\n\\nBut who could it be? I was the only person with a reason to come here, and I was already here. So I decided to ignore the knocking and continue with my scratching. Now the door was making a colossal noise, as though it were about to cave in. The person outside, I realized, was knocking not with his hand but with his foot, and, before I had time to think of a response, the door fell to the floor with such a crash that it sent shock waves through me.\\n\\nA brawny fellow with whiskers on his face charged over to my bed. \\u201cYour friend\\u2019s dying, and you\\u2019re still not up?\\u201d he yelled.\\n\\nI\\u2019d never seen this man before. \\u201cHave you come to the wrong address?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cNo chance of that,\\u201d he answered.\\n\\nHis blithe self-assurance made me wonder whether I had somehow gone to sleep in the wrong bed. I jumped up and ran out into the corridor to check the number on the door. But, of course, the door was now lying on the floor of my apartment. On it was written \\u201c26 Hongqiao New Village, Apt. 3.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIs this the door you just kicked down?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, it is,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nSo this was my apartment. \\u201cYou have definitely come to the wrong place,\\u201d I told him.\\n\\nNow it was my confident manner that confused him. He stared at me for a moment. \\u201cAre you or are you not Yu Hua?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, I am,\\u201d I said, \\u201cbut I don\\u2019t know you.\\u201d\\n\\nHe gave a roar of rage. \\u201cYour friend\\u2019s dying!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut I don\\u2019t have any friends!\\u201d I was roaring, too.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s nonsense, you little philistine!\\u201d He glared.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m no philistine,\\u201d I said. \\u201cYou can see the proof of that in the books that fill my room. If you\\u2019re trying to offload this guy on me, I absolutely refuse, because I have never had a single friend. However\\u2014\\u201d I softened my tone. \\u201cHowever, feel free to donate him to my neighbor in Apartment 4. He\\u2019s got a lot of pals and I don\\u2019t think he\\u2019ll mind if you toss in another.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou fickle little philistine!\\u201d He stretched out an arm as thick as my shin and tried to pull my hair.\\n\\nI shrank back to the corner of the bed, shouting desperately, \\u201cI\\u2019m not a philistine\\u2014and I\\u2019ve got the books to prove it.\\u201d\\n\\nWith his firm, cold hand, he grabbed my feeble, warm foot. Then he hauled me out of bed and dumped me on the floor. \\u201cHurry up and get dressed,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOtherwise I\\u2019ll drag you all the way there just as you are.\\u201d\\n\\nI knew it was pointless to argue any further with this guy, because he was at least five times as strong as me. \\u201cSeeing as a dying man wants to see me,\\u201d I told him, \\u201cof course I\\u2019m happy to go.\\u201d\\n\\nSo that was how, on this lousy morning, a muscleman kicked down my door and lumbered me with a friend I had no interest in having\\u2014a friend who was about to die, no less. What\\u2019s more, the north wind was howling like a banshee outside. I had no overcoat or scarf, no gloves or hat\\u2014all I was wearing was a thin jacket as I went off to visit this friend I knew absolutely nothing about.\\n\\nOnce we were in the street, the north wind blew me and the big fellow to the friend\\u2019s house just as quickly as it would blow leaves off a tree. The doorway was piled high with wreaths. The big fellow turned to me and said dolefully, \\u201cYour friend is dead.\\u201d\\n\\nBefore I had time to consider whether this was a cause for rejoicing or for grief, I heard a loud chorus of weeping, toward which the big fellow proceeded to push me.\\n\\nA crowd of tearful men and women surrounded me. \\u201cDon\\u2019t take things so hard,\\u201d they told me solicitously.\\n\\nAll I could do was nod and put on a show of being sad, because now there was no point in saying the things I really wanted to say. I gently patted their shoulders, showing my appreciation for their condolences.\\n\\nThen an old lady tottered forward and grabbed my hand as tears poured down her face. \\u201cMy son is dead,\\u201d she sobbed.\\n\\n\\u201cI know,\\u201d I said. \\u201cI am very sad, because it all happened so suddenly.\\u201d\\n\\nMy comment loosened the floodgates still further, and her wails were now so piercing my hair stood on end.\\n\\n\\u201cPlease don\\u2019t take it so hard,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nHer crying seemed to subside a little and she began to dry her tears with my hand. Then she raised her head and said, \\u201cYou need to take it in stride, too.\\u201d\\n\\nI nodded reassuringly. \\u201cOh, I will do that. We must transform grief into strength.\\u201d\\n\\nShe nodded. \\u201cMy son closed his eyes before you could get here. You don\\u2019t blame him, do you?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, I\\u2019d never do that,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nAgain she fell into a fit of sobbing. After a while she recovered enough to say, \\u201cHe was the only son I had, but he\\u2019s dead. You\\u2019re my son now.\\u201d\\n\\nTugging desperately, I was finally able to retrieve my hand, on the pretext that I needed it to wipe away my own tears, though I had none. Then I said, \\u201cActually, I\\u2019ve thought of you as my mother for a long time now.\\u201d I had no choice but to say that.\\n\\nShe led me to another room, saying, \\u201cGo in and keep my son company for a bit.\\u201d\\n\\nThe room was empty, apart from a dead man lying in a bed under a white shroud. The chair next to the bed seemed to be meant for me, so I sat down.\\n\\nI sat there for a good long time before lifting the shroud to see what the man looked like. I glimpsed a pale face that gave little indication of age, a face I had never seen before. I put the shroud back and thought, So that\\u2019s my friend.\\n\\nThere I sat, next to the corpse whose face I had just seen but instantly forgotten. Although the man\\u2019s death had delivered me from a friendship I refused to recognize, it had not relieved me of my burden, for his mother had simply taken his place: an old woman I did not know had become my mother. It was only too clear what I had to do next: I\\u2019d have to fork out twenty yuan to buy a big wreath; I\\u2019d have to don sackcloth and guard his coffin; I\\u2019d have to weep and wail and parade through the streets with one arm around the cremation urn and the other propping up his mother. And, after all that was over, I\\u2019d have to sweep his grave every April, not to mention carry on his unfinished labors and perform the duties of a filial son. But the first order of business\\u2014and the most important thing, as far as I was concerned\\u2014was to find a carpenter to rehang the door that the big fellow had kicked down.

Chloe is picking her up soon. It\\u2019s darkening outside. There\\u2019s a rumble in the distance. Thunder spoils milk, her Granny would say. Having lived in Canada for half a century, she never forgot German sayings. Nina empties the rest of the milk into a glass and drinks it up.\\n\\nThey\\u2019ve arrived at the Bavarian Forest Restaurant in Kitchener. The pink neon sign, of which only the \\u201cForest\\u201d part remains, buzzes feebly.\\n\\nThis is their fourth gig at the Bavarian Forest as dancers. A singer and a comedian are also part of the team. Today, instead of Dave, there\\u2019s a new comedian. But they aren\\u2019t surprised. Comedians come, comedians go. Singers come, singers go. Backstage, Chloe and Nina put on their Rio-the-Carnival costumes. Nina puts a tiara on her head. A slight headache has already begun.\\n\\nThe air in the restaurant is stagnant, like that of the Amazon rainforest. Offstage Nina sees Linda humming, pearls of perspiration on her forehead. Nina and Chloe come onstage from either side, eyeing each other with pasted-on smiles. The rhythm doubles. Samba. The scent of Chloe\\u2019s coconut oil lingers in the air, and Nina thinks of her pi\\u00f1a colada at the Copacabana. The red-cheeked old men behind the beer steins catapult their arms into the air, iPhones in their hands.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s okay. People staring at Nina know that she is a dancer.

We\\u2019d been alone in space too long. Back home, we\\u2019d be treated for space sickness and starlust, our brains scanned and studied for signs that our grey matter had deteriorated in the vacuum. We\\u2019d be swaddled in hospitals, kept barefoot and away from the night sky until we stopped dreaming of plumed nebulas and stopped thinking we could hear the music of the spheres in C minor.\\n\\nBut there was no more Earth, and we were lost, limping along to a semi-terraformed planet we were supposed to be studying and would now be colonizing. We\\u2019d taken to talking each other away from the airlock when the stars started looking like houses in the distance and confirming reality as a matter of course. We might all lose our minds, but probably not at the same time.\\n\\n\\u201cDoes this taste like banana?\\u201d Lucinda asked, chewing on a freeze-dried ration. And we\\u2019d all nod.\\n\\n\\u201cI hear someone breathing out there,\\u201d Antin murmured, standing at one of the portholes. And we\\u2019d all say no, it\\u2019s only rock and plasma, come away from there, look at us instead.\\n\\nSo when Carl found the signal and the voice crackled through the speakers, he asked, \\u201cDo you hear a voice?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d said Jane, and Lucinda, and then one by one we all confirmed that we did hear a voice. Muttering, male, half-covered in static. We all bent close to the speakers.\\n\\nThe voice coughed, and paused, and Lucinda covered her mouth.\\n\\nBreath rattled. More words.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s Russian,\\u201d Antin whispered. None of the rest of us spoke it. Hardly anyone in the space programs did anymore. Russia died at the beginning of the slow end. He swayed in time with the enunciation. \\u201cHe says he\\u2019s lost. Over and over. He\\u2019s lost.\\u201d\\n\\nHe grabbed the mic before the rest of us could stop him and broadcast out into the black. \\u201cZdravstvujtye? Zdravstvujtye?\\u201c\\n\\nA pause. We held our breath, our hearts waiting for the next word to start beating again. It had been so long since we\\u2019d savored the sound of a stranger\\u2019s voice.\\n\\nHe began again. The same pattern.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a recording,\\u201d Carl said. He had tears in his eyes. One ended up in his mustache, a shimmer in the energy-efficient lighting.\\n\\nWe let the voice play all night, damn the fuel reserves, damn the razor-thin margins between death and life on a barely-habitable planet.\\n\\nThe next day, we found the ship. Late twentieth century as near as anyone could guess. Our scanners were calibrated for geological identifications only. We didn\\u2019t know what trick of folding space brought it here. The hull was pitted with burn marks and long scratches from debris. It was just big enough for one person who wasn\\u2019t claustrophobic.\\n\\nMatt and Amal volunteered to go aboard. Amal was forty, probably too old to have children when we made landfall. Matt insisted. We could have debated the impact their possible deaths would have on our as-yet-hypothetical colony, but none of the rest of us wanted to stop them. We helped them put on the suits and tethers.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s cold,\\u201d Amal said when she made it aboard. Her chattering teeth made the radio pop. \\u201cThere he is. Look.\\u201d\\n\\nThey had a camera and we tumbled over each other in a mess of arms and legs and sweating palms to get close to the screen. Lucinda and Regan\\u2013who loved each other so secretly that even they didn\\u2019t know it yet\\u2013held onto each other\\u2019s forearms so tight that Lucinda had waning moon scars from Regan\\u2019s nails for the rest of her life. Antin\\u2019s mouth twitched, and we all knew he was aching for the cigarettes he\\u2019d given up to see the stars.\\n\\nAmal held the camera up to where the cosmonaut\\u2019s eyes used to be. He\\u2019d been handsome. He had a vintage face out of the days of Hugo Boss and ships caught in the orbit of a single planet.\\n\\n\\u201cDo you know who he is?\\u201d Carl asked.\\n\\nAntin shook his head. His hands still didn\\u2019t know what to do. \\u201cThere were so many lost in the early days. When my mother was a child, her class listened to the audio of Vladimir Komarov sobbing.\\u201d\\n\\nMatt\\u2019s breath was the rush of the ocean half-remembered. In and out and in and out. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to die up here like that.\\u201d\\n\\nAmal touched the dead man\\u2019s cheek with one gloved finger. With all the air gone, he was a facsimile of human still, even after these hundreds of years. \\u201cHush. We won\\u2019t die. Think of everything that aligned for you to be here, at the right moment and the right velocity, at the same time as he is. We are in the presence of a miracle. Of a universal astronomical improbability. No one is going to die.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t believe in signs,\\u201d Lucinda said from the deck of our ship, with her arms still bleeding in Regan\\u2019s hands. She didn\\u2019t mean it.\\n\\nMatt went to his knees. Amal smoothed her other hand over his helmet and it would have been comforting had they not been separated by six layers of Mylar and mysterious alloys. She kept her other hand on the cosmonaut, and for a moment the dead Earth and the new were separated by only a touch.\\n\\nWe stripped the old ship for precious metals and spare parts, liquefied the body for the carbon. Our fuel reserves rose above the margin of error. We collected the ice crystals from the interior and thrilled at the taste of unfiltered water. It tasted like dust and dirt and everything else we wouldn\\u2019t see again for months.\\n\\nWe kept the recording. Matt played it when we dimmed the lights for nighttime.

Four boys, lanky and tan, were racing against each other. First one pulled ahead, then another, then another. Girls on the sidelines stood cheering, occasionally ripping up grass and throwing it at each other. Finally, one of the boys\\u2014the one with long hair\\u2014won.

She wanted to visit some of her connections in east Tennessee and she was seizing at every chance to change Bailey's mind. Bailey was the son she lived with, her only boy. He was sitting on the edge of his chair at the table, bent over the orange sports section of the Journal. \\\"Now look here, Bailey,\\\" she said, \\\"see here, read this,\\\" and she stood with one hand on her thin hip and the other rattling the newspaper at his bald head. \\\"Here this fellow that calls himself The Misfit is aloose from the Federal Pen and headed toward Florida and you read here what it says he did to these people. Just you read it. I wouldn't take my children in any direction with a criminal like that aloose in it. I couldn't answer to my conscience if I did.\\\"\\n\\nBailey didn't look up from his reading so she wheeled around then and faced the children's mother, a young woman in slacks, whose face was as broad and innocent as a cabbage and was tied around with a green head-kerchief that had two points on the top like rabbit's ears. She was sitting on the sofa, feeding the baby his apricots out of a jar. \\\"The children have been to Florida before,\\\" the old lady said. \\\"You all ought to take them somewhere else for a change so they would see different parts of the world and be broad. They never have been to east Tennessee.\\\"\\n\\nThe children's mother didn't seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, John Wesley, a stocky child with glasses, said, \\\"If you don't want to go to Florida, why dontcha stay at home?\\\" He and the little girl, June Star, were reading the funny papers on the floor.\\n\\n\\\"She wouldn't stay at home to be queen for a day,\\\" June Star said without raising her yellow head.\\n\\n\\\"Yes and what would you do if this fellow, The Misfit, caught you?\\\" the grandmother asked.\\n\\n\\\"I'd smack his face,\\\" John Wesley said.\\n\\n\\\"She wouldn't stay at home for a million bucks,\\\" June Star said. \\\"Afraid she'd miss something. She has to go everywhere we go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right, Miss,\\\" the grandmother said. \\\"Just remember that the next time you want me to curl your hair.\\\"\\n\\nJune Star said her hair was naturally curly.\\n\\nThe next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. She had her big black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it she was hiding a basket with Pitty Sing, the cat, in it. She didn't intend for the cat to be left alone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he might brush against one of the gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. Her son, Bailey, didn't like to arrive at a motel with a cat.\\n\\nShe sat in the middle of the back seat with John Wesley and June Star on either side of her. Bailey and the children's mother and the baby sat in front and they left Atlanta at eight forty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. The grandmother wrote this down because she thought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. It took them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city.\\n\\nThe old lady settled herself comfortably, removing her white cotton gloves and putting them up with her purse on the shelf in front of the back window. The children's mother still had on slacks and still had her head tied up in a green kerchief, but the grandmother had on a navy blue straw sailor hat with a bunch of white violets on the brim and a navy blue dress with a small white dot in the print. Her collars and cuffs were white organdy trimmed with lace and at her neckline she had pinned a purple spray of cloth violets containing a sachet. In case of an accident, anyone seeing her dead on the highway would know at once that she was a lady.\\n\\nShe said she thought it was going to be a good day for driving, neither too hot nor too cold, and she cautioned Bailey that the speed limit was fifty-five miles an hour and that the patrolmen hid themselves behind billboards and small clumps of trees and sped out after you before you had a chance to slow down. She pointed out interesting details of the scenery: Stone Mountain; the blue granite that in some places came up to both sides of the highway; the brilliant red clay banks slightly streaked with purple; and the various crops\\n\\nthat made rows of green lace-work on the ground. The trees were full of silver-white sunlight and the meanest of them sparkled. The children were reading comic magazines and their mother had gone back to sleep.\\n\\n\\\"Let's go through Georgia fast so we won't have to look at it much,\\\" John Wesley said.\\n\\n\\\"If I were a little boy,\\\" said the grandmother, \\\"I wouldn't talk about my native state that way. Tennessee has the mountains and Georgia has the hills.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tennessee is just a hillbilly dumping ground,\\\" John Wesley said, \\\"and Georgia is a lousy state too.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You said it,\\\" June Star said.\\n\\n\\\"In my time,\\\" said the grandmother, folding her thin veined fingers, \\\"children were more respectful of their native states and their parents and everything else. People did right then. Oh look at the cute little pickaninny!\\\" she said and pointed to a Negro child standing in the door of a shack. \\\"Wouldn't that make a picture, now?\\\" she asked and they all turned and looked at the little Negro out of the back window. He waved.\\n\\n\\\"He didn't have any britches on,\\\" June Star said.\\n\\n\\\"He probably didn't have any,\\\" the grandmother explained. \\\"Little niggers in the country don't have things like we do. If I could paint, I'd paint that picture,\\\" she said.\\n\\nThe children exchanged comic books.\\n\\nThe grandmother offered to hold the baby and the children's mother passed him over the front seat to her. She set him on her knee and bounced him and told him about the things they were passing. She rolled her eyes and screwed up her mouth and stuck her leathery thin face into his smooth bland one. Occasionally he gave her a faraway smile. They passed a large cotton field with five or six graves fenced in the middle of it, like a small island. \\\"Look at the graveyard!\\\" the grandmother said, pointing it out. \\\"That was the old family burying ground. That belonged to the plantation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where's the plantation?\\\" John Wesley asked.\\n\\n\\\"Gone With the Wind,\\\" said the grandmother. \\\"Ha. Ha.\\\"\\n\\nWhen the children finished all the comic books they had brought, they opened the lunch and ate it. The grandmother ate a peanut butter sandwich and an olive and would not let\\n\\nthe children throw the box and the paper napkins out the window. When there was nothing else to do they played a game by choosing a cloud and making the other two guess what shape it suggested. John Wesley took one the shape of a cow and June Star guessed a cow and John Wesley said, no, an automobile, and June Star said he didn't play fair, and they began to slap each other over the grandmother.\\n\\nThe grandmother said she would tell them a story if they would keep quiet. When she told a story, she rolled her eyes and waved her head and was very dramatic. She said once when she was a maiden lady she had been courted by a Mr. Edgar Atkins Teagarden from Jasper, Georgia. She said he was a very good-looking man and a gentleman and that he brought her a watermelon every Saturday afternoon with his initials cut in it, E. A. T. Well, one Saturday, she said, Mr. Teagarden brought the watermelon and there was nobody at home and he left it on the front porch and returned in his buggy to Jasper, but she never got the watermelon, she said, because a nigger boy ate it when he saw the initials, E. A. T.! This story tickled John Wesley's funny bone and he giggled and giggled but June Star didn't think it was any good. She said she wouldn't marry a man that just brought her a watermelon on Saturday. The grandmother said she would have done well to marry Mr. Teagarden because he was a gentleman and had bought Coca-Cola stock when it first came out and that he had died only a few years ago, a very wealthy man.\\n\\nThey stopped at The Tower for barbecued sandwiches. The Tower was a part stucco and part wood filling station and dance hall set in a clearing outside of Timothy. A fat man named Red Sammy Butts ran it and there were signs stuck here and there on the building and for miles up and down the highway saying, TRY RED SAMMY'S FAMOUS BARBECUE. NONE LIKE FAMOUS RED SAMMY'S! RED SAM! THE FAT BOY WITH THE HAPPY LAUGH. A VETERAN! RED SAMMY'S YOUR MAN!\\n\\nRed Sammy was lying on the bare ground outside The Tower with his head under a truck while a gray monkey about a foot high, chained to a small chinaberry tree, chattered nearby. The monkey sprang back into the tree and got on the highest limb as soon as he saw the children jump out of the car and run toward him.\\n\\nInside, The Tower was a long dark room with a counter at one end and tables at the other and dancing space in the middle. They all sat down at a board table next to the nickelodeon and Red Sam's wife, a tall burnt-brown woman with hair and eyes lighter than her skin, came and took their order. The children's mother put a dime in the machine and played \\\"The Tennessee Waltz,\\\" and the grandmother said that tune always made her want to dance. She asked Bailey if he would like to dance but he only glared at her. He didn't have a naturally sunny disposition like she did and trips made him nervous. The grandmother's brown eyes were very bright. She swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her chair. June Star said play something she could tap to so the children's mother put in another dime and played a fast number and June Star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap routine.\\n\\n\\\"Ain't she cute?\\\" Red Sam's wife said, leaning over the counter. \\\"Would you like to come be my little girl?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No I certainly wouldn't,\\\" June Star said. \\\"I wouldn't live in a broken-down place like this for a minion bucks!\\\" and she ran back to the table.\\n\\n\\\"Ain't she cute?\\\" the woman repeated, stretching her mouth politely.\\n\\n\\\"Arn't you ashamed?\\\" hissed the grandmother.\\n\\nRed Sam came in and told his wife to quit lounging on the counter and hurry up with these people's order. His khaki trousers reached just to his hip bones and his stomach hung over them like a sack of meal swaying under his shirt. He came over and sat down at a table nearby and let out a combination sigh and yodel. \\\"You can't win,\\\" he said. \\\"You can't win,\\\" and he wiped his sweating red face off with a gray handkerchief. \\\"These days you don't know who to trust,\\\" he said. \\\"Ain't that the truth?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"People are certainly not nice like they used to be,\\\" said the grandmother.\\n\\n\\\"Two fellers come in here last week,\\\" Red Sammy said, \\\"driving a Chrysler. It was a old beat-up car but it was a good one and these boys looked all right to me. Said they worked\\n\\nat the mill and you know I let them fellers charge the gas they bought? Now why did I do that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because you're a good man!\\\" the grandmother said at once.\\n\\n\\\"Yes'm, I suppose so,\\\" Red Sam said as if he were struck with this answer.\\n\\nHis wife brought the orders, carrying the five plates all at once without a tray, two in each hand and one balanced on her arm. \\\"It isn't a soul in this green world of God's that you can trust,\\\" she said. \\\"And I don't count nobody out of that, not nobody,\\\" she repeated, looking at Red Sammy.\\n\\n\\\"Did you read about that criminal, The Misfit, that's escaped?\\\" asked the grandmother.\\n\\n\\\"I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he didn't attact this place right here,\\\" said the woman. \\\"If he hears about it being here,I wouldn't be none surprised to see him. If he hears it's two cent in the cash register, I wouldn't be a tall surprised if he . . .\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That'll do,\\\" Red Sam said. \\\"Go bring these people their Co'-Colas,\\\" and the woman went off to get the rest of the order.\\n\\n\\\"A good man is hard to find,\\\" Red Sammy said. \\\"Every- thing is getting terrible. I remember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more.\\\"\\n\\nHe and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion Europe was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you would think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was exactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the lacy chinaberry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully between his teeth as if it were a delicacy.\\n\\nThey drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grand- mother took cat naps and woke up every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled an old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady. She said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks leading up to it and two little wooden trellis\\n\\narbors on either side in front where you sat down with your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to it. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the more she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin arbors were still standing. \\\"There was a secret panel in this house,\\\" she said craftily, not telling the truth but wishing that she were, \\\"and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in it when Sherman came through but it was never found . . .\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hey!\\\" John Wesley said. \\\"Let's go see it! We'll find it! We'll poke all the woodwork and find it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can't we turn off there?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We never have seen a house with a secret panel!\\\" June Star shrieked. \\\"Let's go to the house with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can't we go see the house with the secret panel!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's not far from here, I know,\\\" the grandmother said. \\\"It wouldn't take over twenty minutes.\\\"\\n\\nBailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. \\\"No,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret panel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother's shoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their vacation, that they could never do what THEY wanted to do. The baby began to scream and John Wesley kicked the back of the seat so hard that his father could feel the blows in his kidney.\\n\\n\\\"All right!\\\" he shouted and drew the car to a stop at the side of the road. \\\"Will you all shut up? Will you all just shut up for one second? If you don't shut up, we won't go anywhere.\\n\\n\\\"It would be very educational for them,\\\" the grandmother murmured.\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" Bailey said, \\\"but get this: this is the only time we're going to stop for anything like this. This is the one and only time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The dirt road that you have to turn down is about a mile back,\\\" the grandmother directed. \\\"I marked it when we passed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A dirt road,\\\" Bailey groaned.\\n\\nAfter they had turned around and were headed toward the dirt road, the grandmother recalled other points about the house, the beautiful glass over the front doorway and the candle-lamp in the hall. John Wesley said that the secret panel was probably in the fireplace.\\n\\n\\\"You can't go inside this house,\\\" Bailey said. \\\"You don't know who lives there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"While you all talk to the people in front, I'll run around behind and get in a window,\\\" John Wesley suggested.\\n\\n\\\"We'll all stay in the car,\\\" his mother said. They turned onto the dirt road and the car raced roughly along in a swirl of pink dust. The grandmother recalled the times when there were no paved roads and thirty miles was a day's journey. The dirt road was hilly and there were sudden washes in it and sharp curves on dangerous embankments. All at once they would be on a hill, looking down over the blue tops of trees for miles around, then the next minute, they would be in a red depression with the dust-coated trees looking down on them.\\n\\n\\\"This place had better turn up in a minute,\\\" Bailey said, \\\"or I'm going to turn around.\\\"\\n\\nThe road looked as if no one had traveled on it in months.\\n\\n\\\"It's not much farther,\\\" the grandmother said and just as she said it, a horrible thought came to her. The thought was so embarrassing that she turned red in the face and her eyes dilated and her feet jumped up, upsetting her valise in the corner. The instant the valise moved, the newspaper top she had over the basket under it rose with a snarl and Pitty Sing,the cat, sprang onto Bailey's shoulder.\\n\\nThe children were thrown to the floor and their mother, clutching the baby, was thrown out the door onto the ground; the old lady was thrown into the front seat. The car turned over once and landed right-side-up in a gulch off the side of the road. Bailey remained in the driver's seat with the cat-gray-striped with a broad white face and an orange nose-clinging to his neck like a caterpillar.\\n\\nAs soon as the children saw they could move their arms and legs, they scrambled out of the car, shouting, \\\"We've had an ACCIDENT!\\\" The grandmother was curled up under the\\n\\ndashboard, hoping she was injured so that Bailey's wrath would not come down on her all at once. The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had remembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee.\\n\\nBailey removed the cat from his neck with both hands and flung it out the window against the side of a pine tree. Then he got out of the car and started looking for the children's mother. She was sitting against the side of the red gutted ditch, holding the screaming baby, but she only had a cut down her face and a broken shoulder. \\\"We've had an ACCIDENT!\\\" the children screamed in a frenzy of delight.\\n\\n\\\"But nobody's killed,\\\" June Star said with disappointment as the grandmother limped out of the car, her hat still pinned to her head but the broken front brim standing up at a jaunty angle and the violet spray hanging off the side. They all sat down in the ditch, except the children, to recover from the shock. They were all shaking.\\n\\n\\\"Maybe a car will come along,\\\" said the children's mother hoarsely.\\n\\n\\\"I believe I have injured an organ,\\\" said the grandmother, pressing her side, but no one answered her. Bailey's teeth were clattering. He had on a yellow sport shirt with bright blue parrots designed in it and his face was as yellow as the l shirt. The grandmother decided that she would not mention that the house was in Tennessee.\\n\\nThe road was about ten feet above and they could see only the tops of the trees on the other side of it. Behind the ditch they were sitting in there were more woods, tall and dark and deep. In a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as if the occupants were watching them. The grandmother stood up and waved both arms dramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared around a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over. It was a big black battered hearse-like automobile. There were three men in it.\\n\\nIt came to a stop just over them and for some minutes, the driver looked down with a steady expressionless gaze to where they were sitting, and didn't speak. Then he turned his\\n\\nhead and muttered something to the other two and they got out. One was a fat boy in black trousers and a red sweat shirt with a silver stallion embossed on the front of it. He moved around on the right side of them and stood staring, his mouth partly open in a kind of loose grin. The other had on khaki pants and a blue striped coat and a gray hat pulled down very low, hiding most of his face. He came around slowly on the left side. Neither spoke.\\n\\nThe driver got out of the car and stood by the side of it, looking down at them. He was an older man than the other two. His hair was just beginning to gray and he wore silver- rimmed spectacles that gave him a scholarly look. He had a long creased face and didn't have on any shirt or undershirt. He had on blue jeans that were too tight for him and was holding a black hat and a gun. The two boys also had guns.\\n\\n\\\"We've had an ACCIDENT!\\\" the children screamed.\\n\\nThe grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she knew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known him au her life but she could not recall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment, placing his feet carefully so that he wouldn't slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks, and his ankles were red and thin. \\\"Good afternoon,\\\" he said. \\\"I see you all had you a little spill.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We turned over twice!\\\" said the grandmother.\\n\\n\\\"Once\\\",\\\" he corrected. \\\"We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram,\\\" he said quietly to the boy with the gray hat.\\n\\n\\\"What you got that gun for?\\\" John Wesley asked. \\\"Whatcha gonna do with that gun?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lady,\\\" the man said to the children's mother, \\\"would you mind calling them children to sit down by you? Children make me nervous. I want all you all to sit down right together there where you're at.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What are you telling US what to do for?\\\" June Star asked.\\n\\nBehind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. \\\"Come here,\\\" said their mother.\\n\\n\\\"Look here now,\\\" Bailey began suddenly, \\\"we're in a predicament! We're in . . .\\\"\\n\\nThe grandmother shrieked. She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. \\\"You're The Misfit!\\\" she said. \\\"I recognized you at once!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes'm,\\\" the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be known, \\\"but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn't of reckernized me.\\\"\\n\\nBailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the children. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened.\\n\\n\\\"Lady,\\\" he said, \\\"don't you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don't mean. I don't reckon he meant to talk to you thataway.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You wouldn't shoot a lady, would you?\\\" the grandmother said and removed a clean handkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.\\n\\nThe Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then covered it up again. \\\"I would hate to have to,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Listen,\\\" the grandmother almost screamed, \\\"I know you're a good man. You don't look a bit like you have com- mon blood. I know you must come from nice people!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes mam,\\\" he said, \\\"finest people in the world.\\\" When he smiled he showed a row of strong white teeth. \\\"God never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy's heart was pure gold,\\\" he said. The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was standing with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. \\\"Watch them children, Bobby Lee,\\\" he said. \\\"You know they make me nervous.\\\" He looked at the six of them huddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn't think of anything to say. \\\"Ain't a cloud in the sky,\\\" he remarked, looking up at it. \\\"Don't see no sun but don't see no cloud neither.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, it's a beautiful day,\\\" said the grandmother. \\\"Listen,\\\" she said, \\\"you shouldn't call yourself The Misfit because I know you're a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hush!\\\" Bailey yelled. \\\"Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!\\\" He was squatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn't move.\\n\\n\\\"I prechate that, lady,\\\" The Misfit said and drew a little circle in the ground with the butt of his gun.\\n\\n\\\"It'll take a half a hour to fix this here car,\\\" Hiram called, looking over the raised hood of it.\\n\\n\\\"Well, first you and Bobby Lee get him and that little boy to step over yonder with you,\\\" The Misfit said, pointing to Bailey and John Wesley. \\\"The boys want to ast you some- thing,\\\" he said to Bailey. \\\"Would you mind stepping back in them woods there with them?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Listen,\\\" Bailey began, \\\"we're in a terrible predicament! Nobody realizes what this is,\\\" and his voice cracked. His eyes were as blue and intense as the parrots in his shirt and he remained perfectly still.\\n\\nThe grandmother reached up to adjust her hat brim as if she were going to the woods with him but it came off in her hand. She stood staring at it and after a second she let it fall on the ground. Hiram pulled Bailey up by the arm as if he were assisting an old man. John Wesley caught hold of his father's hand and Bobby Lee followed. They went off toward the woods and just as they reached the dark edge, Bailey turned and supporting himself against a gray naked pine trunk, he shouted, \\\"I'll be back in a minute, Mamma, wait on me!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come back this instant!\\\" his mother shrilled but they all disappeared into the woods.\\n\\n\\\"Bailey Boy!\\\" the grandmother called in a tragic voice but she found she was looking at The Misfit squatting on the ground in front of her. \\\"I just know you're a good man,\\\" she said desperately. \\\"You're not a bit common!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nome, I ain't a good man,\\\" The Misfit said after a second as if he had considered her statement carefully, \\\"but I ain't the worst in the world neither. My daddy said I was a different breed of dog from my brothers and sisters. 'You know,' Daddy said, 'it's some that can live their whole life out without asking about it and it's others has to know why it is, and this boy is one of the latters. He's going to be into every- thing!'\\\" He put on his black hat and looked up suddenly and then away deep into the woods as if he were embarrassed again. \\\"I'm sorry I don't have on a shirt before you ladies,\\\" he said, hunching his shoulders slightly. \\\"We buried our clothes that we had on when we escaped and we're just\\n\\nmaking do until we can get better. We borrowed these from some folks we met,\\\" he explained.\\n\\n\\\"That's perfectly all right,\\\" the grandmother said. \\\"Maybe Bailey has an extra shirt in his suitcase.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll look and see terrectly,\\\" The Misfit said.\\n\\n\\\"Where are they taking him?\\\" the children's mother screamed.\\n\\n\\\"Daddy was a card himself,\\\" The Misfit said. \\\"You couldn't put anything over on him. He never got in trouble with the Authorities though. Just had the knack of handling them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You could be honest too if you'd only try,\\\" said the grandmother. \\\"Think how wonderful it would be to settle down and live a comfortable life and not have to think about some- body chasing you all the time.\\\"\\n\\nThe Misfit kept scratching in the ground with the butt of his gun as if he were thinking about it. \\\"Yes'm, somebody is always after you,\\\" he murmured.\\n\\nThe grandmother noticed how thin his shoulder blades were just behind-his hat because she was standing up looking down on him. \\\"Do you ever pray?\\\" she asked.\\n\\nHe shook his head. All she saw was the black hat wiggle between his shoulder blades. \\\"Nome,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThere was a pistol shot from the woods, followed closely by another. Then silence. The old lady's head jerked around. She could hear the wind move through the tree tops like a long satisfied insuck of breath. \\\"Bailey Boy!\\\" she called.\\n\\n\\\"I was a gospel singer for a while,\\\" The Misfit said. \\\"I been most everything. Been in the arm service, both land and sea, at home and abroad, been twict married, been an undertaker, been with the railroads, plowed Mother Earth, been in a tornado, seen a man burnt alive oncet,\\\" and he looked up at the children's mother and the little girl who were sitting close together, their faces white and their eyes glassy; \\\"I even seen a woman flogged,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Pray, pray,\\\" the grandmother began, \\\"pray, pray . . .\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I never was a bad boy that I remember of,\\\" The Misfit said in an almost dreamy voice, \\\"but somewheres along the line I done something wrong and got sent to the penitentiary. I was buried alive,\\\" and he looked up and held her attention to him by a steady stare.\\n\\n\\\"That's when you should have started to pray,\\\" she said \\\"What did you do to get sent to the penitentiary that first time?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Turn to the right, it was a wall,\\\" The Misfit said, looking up again at the cloudless sky. \\\"Turn to the left, it was a wall. Look up it was a ceiling, look down it was a floor. I forget what I done, lady. I set there and set there, trying to remember what it was I done and I ain't recalled it to this day. Oncet in a while, I would think it was coming to me, but it never come.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maybe they put you in by mistake,\\\" the old lady said vaguely.\\n\\n\\\"Nome,\\\" he said. \\\"It wasn't no mistake. They had the papers on me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You must have stolen something,\\\" she said.\\n\\nThe Misfit sneered slightly. \\\"Nobody had nothing I wanted,\\\" he said. \\\"It was a head-doctor at the penitentiary said what I had done was kill my daddy but I known that for a lie. My daddy died in nineteen ought nineteen of the epidemic flu and I never had a thing to do with it. He was buried in the Mount Hopewell Baptist churchyard and you can go there and see for yourself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you would pray,\\\" the old lady said, \\\"Jesus would help you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's right,\\\" The Misfit said.\\n\\n\\\"Well then, why don't you pray?\\\" she asked trembling with delight suddenly.\\n\\n\\\"I don't want no hep,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm doing all right by myself.\\\"\\n\\nBobby Lee and Hiram came ambling back from the woods. Bobby Lee was dragging a yellow shirt with bright blue parrots in it.\\n\\n\\\"Thow me that shirt, Bobby Lee,\\\" The Misfit said. The shirt came flying at him and landed on his shoulder and he put it on. The grandmother couldn't name what the shirt reminded her of. \\\"No, lady,\\\" The Misfit said while he was buttoning it up, \\\"I found out the crime don't matter. You can do one thing or you can do another, kill a man or take a tire off his car, because sooner or later you're going to forget what it was you done and just be punished for it.\\\"\\n\\nThe children's mother had begun to make heaving noises as if she couldn't get her breath. \\\"Lady,\\\" he asked, \\\"would you and that little girl like to step off yonder with Bobby Lee and Hiram and join your husband?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, thank you,\\\" the mother said faintly. Her left arm dangled helplessly and she was holding the baby, who had gone to sleep, in the other. \\\"Hep that lady up, Hiram,\\\" The Misfit said as she struggled to climb out of the ditch, \\\"and Bobby Lee, you hold onto that little girl's hand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't want to hold hands with him,\\\" June Star said. \\\"He reminds me of a pig.\\\"\\n\\nThe fat boy blushed and laughed and caught her by the arm and pulled her off into the woods after Hiram and her mother.\\n\\nAlone with The Misfit, the grandmother found that she had lost her voice. There was not a cloud in the sky nor any sun. There was nothing around her but woods. She wanted to tell him that he must pray. She opened and closed her mouth several times before anything came out. Finally she found herself saying, \\\"Jesus. Jesus,\\\" meaning, Jesus will help you, but the way she was saying it, it sounded as if she might be cursing.\\n\\n\\\"Yes'm,\\\" The Misfit said as if he agreed. \\\"Jesus shown everything off balance. It was the same case with Him as with me except He hadn't committed any crime and they could prove I had committed one because they had the papers on me. Of course,\\\" he said, \\\"they never shown me my papers. That's why I sign myself now. I said long ago, you get you a signature and sign everything you do and keep a copy of it. Then you'll know what you done and you can hold up the crime to the punishment and see do they match and in the end you'll have something to prove you ain't been treated right. I call myself The Misfit,\\\" he said, \\\"because I can't make what all I done wrong fit what all I gone through in punishment.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a piercing scream from the woods, followed closely by a pistol report. \\\"Does it seem right to you, lady, that one is punished a heap and another ain't punished at all?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Jesus!\\\" the old lady cried. \\\"You've got good blood! I know you wouldn't shoot a lady! I know you come from nice people! Pray! Jesus, you ought not to shoot a lady. I'll give you all the money I've got!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lady,\\\" The Misfit said, looking beyond her far into the woods, \\\"there never was a body that give the undertaker a tip.\\\"\\n\\nThere were two more pistol reports and the grandmother raised her head like a parched old turkey hen crying for water and called, \\\"Bailey Boy, Bailey Boy!\\\" as if her heart would break.\\n\\n\\\"Jesus was the only One that ever raised the dead,\\\" The Misfit continued, \\\"and He shouldn't have done it. He shown everything off balance. If He did what He said, then it's nothing for you to do but thow away everything and follow Him, and if He didn't, then it's nothing for you to do but enjoy the few minutes you got left the best way you can-by killing somebody or burning down his house or doing some other meanness to him. No pleasure but meanness,\\\" he said and his voice had become almost a snarl.\\n\\n\\\"Maybe He didn't raise the dead,\\\" the old lady mumbled, not knowing what she was saying and feeling so dizzy that she sank down in the ditch with her legs twisted under her.\\n\\n\\\"I wasn't there so I can't say He didn't,\\\" The Misfit said. \\\"I wisht I had of been there,\\\" he said, hitting the ground with his fist. \\\"It ain't right I wasn't there because if I had of been there I would of known. Listen lady,\\\" he said in a high voice, \\\"if I had of been there I would of known and I wouldn't be like I am now.\\\" His voice seemed about to crack and the grandmother's head cleared for an instant. She saw the man's face twisted close to her own as if he were going to cry and she murmured, \\\"Why you're one of my babies. You're one of my own children!\\\" She reached out and touched him on the shoulder. The Misfit sprang back as if a snake had bitten him and shot her three times through the chest. Then he put his gun down on the ground and took off his glasses and began to clean them.\\n\\nHiram and Bobby Lee returned from the woods and stood over the ditch, looking down at the grandmother who half sat and half lay in a puddle of blood with her legs crossed under her like a child's and her face smiling up at the cloudless sky.\\n\\nWithout his glasses, The Misfit's eyes were red-rimmed and pale and defenseless-looking. \\\"Take her off and thow her where you shown the others,\\\" he said, picking up the cat that was rubbing itself against his leg.\\n\\n\\\"She was a talker, wasn't she?\\\" Bobby Lee said, sliding down the ditch with a yodel.\\n\\n\\\"She would of been a good woman,\\\" The Misfit said, \\\"if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Some fun!\\\" Bobby Lee said.\\n\\n\\\"Shut up, Bobby Lee\\\" The Misfit said. \\\"It's no real pleasure in life.\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"\\\"The Grandmother\\\" is a short story by Flannery O'Connor that revolves around a family road trip that takes a dark turn. The story begins with the grandmother trying to convince her son, Bailey, to change their vacation plans to Florida and go to Tennessee instead, due to her fear of a criminal called The Misfit who has escaped from prison and is heading towards Florida. Despite her efforts, the family continues their journey towards Florida.\\n\\nDuring the car ride, the grandmother engages in a conversation with her grandchildren, John Wesley and June Star, about the criminal, and they express their lack of concern. They mock their grandmother's worry and imply that she wouldn't stay at home even if The Misfit were to catch her. As they continue driving, the grandmother tells stories and tries to engage the family, all while worrying about the escaped criminal.\\n\\nEventually, the family stops at a restaurant called The Tower, where they have a tense encounter with Red Sammy Butts, the owner, who laments about the lack of trustworthiness in people. The grandmother mentions the criminal, and Red Sammy becomes concerned about their safety. They leave the restaurant and continue their journey.\\n\\nWhile on the road, the grandmother suddenly recalls a house in Tennessee that she wants to visit. She convinces Bailey to take a detour and visit the house, but along the way, she realizes that the house is actually in Tennessee, not Georgia. Distressed, she keeps this information to herself.\\n\\nAs they drive on a remote dirt road, the grandmother becomes increasingly anxious about the destination, and Bailey, frustrated with her, loses control of the car and it overturns in a ditch. Moments later, a car approaches them, and three men, including The Misfit, get out. The grandmother recognizes The Misfit and panics, trying to reason with him and impress upon him that he is a good man with good blood. The Misfit and his accomplices take Bailey and his son, John Wesley, into the woods, leaving the grandmother alone with The Misfit. She continues to plead for her life, even referring to The Misfit as one of her own children.\\n\\nThe Misfit becomes agitated and shoots the grandmother three times. He then orders his accomplices to take the grandmother's body to where they had taken Bailey and John Wesley. The story concludes with The Misfit reflecting on the grandmother's talkative nature and her fascination with him before leaving the scene.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"In the short story \\\"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\\\" by Flannery O'Connor, the Grandmother insists on taking a trip to east Tennessee instead of going to Florida with her son Bailey and his family. She argues with Bailey over a newspaper article that mentions an escaped criminal called The Misfit heading towards Florida. The Grandmother fears that he might harm her family, but Bailey dismisses her concerns.\\n\\nThey set off on the car trip, and along the way, the Grandmother reminisces about her past and continuously tries to convince Bailey to take the detour to see an old plantation house. The children, John Wesley and June Star, are disinterested and ask her why she doesn't just stay home if she doesn't want to go to Florida.\\n\\nThe family stops at a roadside diner called The Tower, and they encounter a man named Red Sammy Butts. Red Sammy complains about how the world has gotten worse with dishonest people and reflects on a recent incident where two strangers tricked him into giving them money for gas. The Grandmother tells Red Sammy about an escaped criminal on the loose, but he dismisses her warnings.\\n\\nBack on the road, the Grandmother unknowingly causes an accident by startling the family cat, Pitty Sing, who leaps onto Bailey's shoulder, distracting him. The car overturns, and they are stranded in the middle of nowhere.\\n\\nAs they wait for someone to help, a car with three men arrives. The leader is The Misfit, the escaped criminal the Grandmother had warned them about. The family is led into the woods with him, leaving Bailey and his son unarmed. The Grandmother tries to initiate a conversation about religion and goodness with The Misfit while subtly trying to convince him not to harm her family. Meanwhile, the other two men, Bobby Lee and Hiram, take Bailey and the young boy into the woods separately.\\n\\nUltimately, The Misfit ends up shooting the entire family, starting with the Grandmother. The story ends with The Misfit reflecting on his actions and the difficult questions about goodness, faith, and humanity that his encounter with the family raises.\\n\\nThroughout the story, O'Connor explores themes of violence, manipulation, and redemption as she delves into the complex motivations of her characters. The Grandmother, in her self-absorption and insistence on doing as she pleases, ends up inadvertently leading her family into the hands of dangerous individuals. Conversely, The Misfit is portrayed as a complex character, capable of glimpses of self-awareness and grappling with questions of morality.

An uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces.\\nThe former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back drawing-room. Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all the rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers. Among these I found a few paper-covered books, the pages of which were curled and damp: The Abbot, by Walter Scott, The Devout Communicant, and The Memoirs of Vidocq. I liked the last best because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house contained a central apple-tree and a few straggling bushes, under one of which I found the late tenant's rusty bicycle-pump. He had been a very charitable priest; in his will he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of his house to his sister.\\nWhen the short days of winter came, dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinners. When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the silent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses, where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness. When we returned to the street, light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner, we hid in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan's sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea, we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan's steps resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her before he obeyed, and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body, and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side.\\nEvery morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood.\\nHer image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance. On Saturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I had to go to carry some of the parcels. We walked through the flaring streets, jostled by drunken men and bargaining women, amid the curses of labourers, the shrill litanies of shop-boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs' cheeks, the nasal chanting of street-singers, who sang a come-all-you about O'Donovan Rossa, or a ballad about the troubles in our native land. These noises converged in a single sensation of life for me: I imagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes. Her name sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and praises which I myself did not understand. My eyes were often full of tears I could not tell why and at times a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out into my bosom. I thought little of the future. I did not know whether I would ever speak to her or not or, if I spoke to her, how I could tell her of my confused adoration. But my body was like a harp and her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the wires.\\nOne evening I went into the back drawing-room in which the priest had died. It was a dark rainy evening and there was no sound in the house. Through one of the broken panes I heard the rain impinge upon the earth, the fine incessant needles of water playing in the sodden beds. Some distant lamp or lighted window gleamed below me. I was thankful that I could see so little. All my senses seemed to desire to veil themselves and, feeling that I was about to slip from them, I pressed the palms of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: 'O love! O love!' many times.\\nAt last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me was I going to Araby. I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It would be a splendid bazaar; she said she would love to go.\\n'And why can't you?' I asked.\\nWhile she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist. She could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week in her convent. Her brother and two other boys were fighting for their caps, and I was alone at the railings. She held one of the spikes, bowing her head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one side of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible as she stood at ease.\\n'It's well for you,' she said.\\n'If I go,' I said, 'I will bring you something.'\\nWhat innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts after that evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening days. I chafed against the work of school. At night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came between me and the page I strove to read. The syllables of the word Araby were called to me through the silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment over me. I asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night. My aunt was surprised, and hoped it was not some Freemason affair. I answered few questions in class. I watched my master's face pass from amiability to sternness; he hoped I was not beginning to idle. I could not call my wandering thoughts together. I had hardly any patience with the serious work of life which, now that it stood between me and my desire, seemed to me child's play, ugly monotonous child's play.\\nOn Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to the bazaar in the evening. He was fussing at the hallstand, looking for the hat-brush, and answered me curtly:\\n'Yes, boy, I know.'\\nAs he was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour and lie at the window. I felt the house in bad humour and walked slowly towards the school. The air was pitilessly raw and already my heart misgave me.\\nWhen I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home. Still it was early. I sat staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking began to irritate me, I left the room. I mounted the staircase and gained the upper part of the house. The high, cold, empty, gloomy rooms liberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front window I saw my companions playing below in the street. Their cries reached me weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the cool glass, I looked over at the dark house where she lived. I may have stood there for an hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress.\\nWhen I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at the fire. She was an old, garrulous woman, a pawnbroker's widow, who collected used stamps for some pious purpose. I had to endure the gossip of the tea-table. The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come. Mrs Mercer stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn't wait any longer, but it was after eight o'clock and she did not like to be out late, as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone I began to walk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said:\\n'I'm afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord.'\\nAt nine o'clock I heard my uncle's latchkey in the hall door. I heard him talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had received the weight of his overcoat. I could interpret these signs. When he was midway through his dinner I asked him to give me the money to go to the bazaar. He had forgotten.\\n'The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,' he said.\\nI did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically:\\n'Can't you give him the money and let him go? You've kept him late enough as it is.'\\nMy uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he believed in the old saying: 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.' He asked me where I was going and, when I told him a second time, he asked me did I know The Arab's Farewell to his Steed. When I left the kitchen he was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt.\\nI held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street towards the station. The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled to me the purpose of my journey. I took my seat in a third-class carriage of a deserted train. After an intolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly. It crept onward among ruinous houses and over the twinkling river. At Westland Row Station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors; but the porters moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the bazaar. I remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the train drew up beside an improvised wooden platform. I passed out on to the road and saw by the lighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me was a large building which displayed the magical name.\\nI could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the bazaar would be closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile, handing a shilling to a weary-looking man. I found myself in a big hall girded at half its height by a gallery. Nearly all the stalls were closed and the greater part of the hall was in darkness. I recognized a silence like that which pervades a church after a service. I walked into the centre of the bazaar timidly. A few people were gathered about the stalls which were still open. Before a curtain, over which the words Caf\\u00e9 Chantant were written in coloured lamps, two men were counting money on a salver. I listened to the fall of the coins.\\nRemembering with difficulty why I had come, I went over to one of the stalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered tea-sets. At the door of the stall a young lady was talking and laughing with two young gentlemen. I remarked their English accents and listened vaguely to their conversation.\\n'O, I never said such a thing!'\\n'O, but you did!'\\n'O, but I didn't!'\\n'Didn't she say that?'\\n'Yes. I heard her.'\\n'O, there's a. . . fib!'\\nObserving me, the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy anything. The tone of her voice was not encouraging; she seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense of duty. I looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern guards at either side of the dark entrance to the stall and murmured:\\n'No, thank you.'\\nThe young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to the two young men. They began to talk of the same subject. Once or twice the young lady glanced at me over her shoulder.\\nI lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make my interest in her wares seem the more real. Then I turned away slowly and walked down the middle of the bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to fall against the sixpence in my pocket. I heard a voice call from one end of the gallery that the light was out. The upper part of the hall was now completely dark.\\nGazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story is set in North Richmond Street, a quiet street where the Christian Brothers' School releases the boys at the end of the day.

This one is so very old that I cannot understand how it has clung so vividly and tenaciously to my memory. Since then I have seen so many sinister things, either affecting or terrible, that I am astonished at not being able to pass a single day without the face of Mother Bellflower recurring to my mind's eye, just as I knew her formerly long, long ago, when I was ten or twelve years old.\\nShe was an old seamstress who came to my parents' house once a week, every Thursday, to mend the linen. My parents lived in one of those country houses called chateaux, which are merely old houses with pointed roofs, to which are attached three or four adjacent farms.\\nThe village, a large village, almost a small market town, was a few hundred yards off and nestled round the church, a red brick church, which had become black with age.\\nWell, every Thursday Mother Bellflower came between half-past six and seven in the morning and went immediately into the linen room and began to work. She was a tall, thin, bearded or rather hairy woman, for she had a beard all over her face, a surprising, an unexpected beard, growing in improbable tufts, in curly bunches which looked as if they had been sown by a madman over that great face, the face of a gendarme in petticoats. She had them on her nose, under her nose, round her nose, on her chin, on her cheeks, and her eyebrows, which were extraordinarily thick and long and quite gray, bushy and bristling, looked exactly like a pair of mustaches stuck on there by mistake.\\nShe limped, not like lame people generally do, but like a ship pitching. When she planted her great bony, vibrant body on her sound leg, she seemed to be preparing to mount some enormous wave, and then suddenly she dipped as if to disappear in an abyss and buried herself in the ground. Her walk reminded one of a ship in a storm, and her head, which was always covered with an enormous white cap, whose ribbons fluttered down her back, seemed to traverse the horizon from north to south and from south to north at each limp.\\nI adored Mother Bellflower. As soon as I was up I used to go into the linen room, where I found her installed at work with a foot warmer under her feet. As soon as I arrived she made me take the foot warmer and sit upon it, so that I might not catch cold in that large chilly room under the roof.\\n\\\"That draws the blood from your head,\\\" she would say to me.\\nShe told me stories while mending the linen with her long, crooked, nimble fingers; behind her magnifying spectacles, for age had impaired her sight, her eyes appeared enormous to me, strangely profound, double.\\nAs far as I can remember from the things which she told me and by which my childish heart was moved, she had the large heart of a poor woman. She told me what had happened in the village, how a cow had escaped from the cow house and had been found the next morning in front of Prosper Malet's mill looking at the sails turning, or about a hen's egg which had been found in the church belfry without anyone being able to understand what creature had been there to lay it, or the queer story of Jean Pila's dog who had gone ten leagues to bring back his master's breeches which a tramp had stolen while they were hanging up to dry out of doors after he had been caught in the rain. She told me these simple adventures in such a manner that in my mind they assumed the proportions of never-to-be-forgotten dramas, of grand and mysterious poems; and the ingenious stories invented by the poets, which my mother told me in the evening, had none of the flavor, none of the fullness or of the vigor of the peasant woman's narratives.\\nWell, one Thursday when I had spent all the morning in listening to Mother Clochette, I wanted to go upstairs to her again during the day after picking hazelnuts with the manservant in the wood behind the farm. I remember it all as clearly as what happened only yesterday.\\nOn opening the door of the linen room I saw the old seamstress lying on the floor by the side of her chair, her face turned down and her arms stretched out, but still holding her needle in one hand and one of my shirts in the other. One of her legs in a blue stocking, the longer one no doubt, was extended under her chair, and her spectacles glistened by the wall, where they had rolled away from her.\\nI ran away uttering shrill cries. They all came running, and in a few minutes I was told that Mother Clochette was dead.\\nI cannot describe the profound, poignant, terrible emotion which stirred my childish heart. I went slowly down into the drawing room and hid myself in a dark corner in the depths of a great old armchair, where I knelt and wept. I remained there for a long time, no doubt, for night came on. Suddenly someone came in with a lamp--without seeing me, however--and heard my father and mother talking with the medical man, whose voice recognized.\\nHe had been sent for immediately, and he was explaining the cause of the accident, of which I understood nothing, however. Then he sat down and had a glass of liqueur and a biscuit.\\nHe went on talking, and what he then said will remain engraved on my mind until I die. I think that I can give the exact words which he used.\\n\\\"Ah!\\\" he said. \\\"The poor woman! she broke her leg the day of my arrival here. I had not even had time to wash my hands after getting off the diligence before I was sent for in all haste, for it was a bad case, very bad.\\n\\\"She was seventeen and a pretty girl, very pretty! Would anyone believe it? I have never told her story before; in fact, no one but myself and one other person, who is no longer living in this part of the country, ever knew it. Now that she is dead I may be less discreet.\\n\\\"A young assistant teacher had just come to live in the village; he was good looking and had the bearing of a soldier. All the girls ran after him, but he was disdainful. Besides that, he was very much afraid of his superior, the schoolmaster, old Grabu, who occasionally got out of bed the wrong foot first.\\n\\\"Old Grabu already employed pretty Hortense, who has just died here and who was afterward nicknamed Clochette. The assistant master singled out the pretty young girl who was no doubt flattered at being chosen by this disdainful conqueror; at any rate, she fell in love with him, and he succeeded in persuading her to give him a first meeting in the hayloft behind the school at night after she had done her day's sewing.\\n\\\"She pretended to go home, but instead of going downstairs when she left the Grabus', she went upstairs and hid among the hay to wait for her lover. He soon joined her, and he was beginning to say pretty things to her, when the door of the hayloft opened and the schoolmaster appeared and asked: 'What are you doing up there, Sigisbert?' Feeling sure that he would be caught, the young schoolmaster lost his presence of mind and replied stupidly: 'I came up here to rest a little among the bundles of hay, Monsieur Grabu.'\\n\\\"The loft was very large and absolutely dark. Sigisbert pushed the frightened girl to the farther end and said: 'Go, there and hide yourself. I shall lose my situation, so get away and hide yourself.'\\n\\\"When the schoolmaster heard the whispering he continued: 'Why, you are not by yourself.'\\n\\\"'Yes, I am, Monsieur Grabu!'\\n\\\"'But you are not, for you are talking.'\\n\\\"'I swear I am, Monsieur Grabu.'\\n\\\"'I will soon find out,' the old man replied and, double-locking the door, he went down to get a light.\\n\\\"Then the young man, who was a coward such as one sometimes meets, lost his head, and he repeated, having grown furious all of a sudden: 'Hide yourself, so that he may not find you. You will deprive me of my bread for my whole life; you will ruin my whole career! Do hide yourself!'\\n\\\"They could hear the key turning in the lock again, and Hortense ran to the window which looked out onto the street, opened it quickly and then in a low and determined voice said: 'You will come and pick me up when he is gone,' and she jumped out.\\n\\\"Old Grabu found nobody and went down again in great surprise! A quarter of an hour later Monsieur Sigisbert came to me and related his adventure. The girl had remained at the foot of the wall, unable to get up, as she had fallen from the second story, and I went with him to fetch her. It was raining in torrents, and I brought the unfortunate girl home with me, for the right leg was broken in three places, and the bones had come out through the flesh. She did not complain and merely said with admirable resignation: 'I am punished, well punished!'\\n\\\"I sent for assistance and for the workgirl's friends and told them a made-up story of a runaway carriage which had knocked her down and lamed her outside my door. They believed me, and the gendarmes for a whole month tried in vain to find the author of this accident.\\n\\\"That is all! Now I say that this woman was a heroine and had the fiber of those who accomplish the grandest deeds in history.\\n\\\"That was her only love affair, and she died a virgin. She was a martyr, a noble soul, a sublimely devoted woman! And if I did not absolutely admire her I should not have told you this story, which I would never tell anyone during her life; you understand why.\\\"\\nThe doctor ceased; Mamma cried, and Papa said some words which I did not catch; then they left the room, and I remained on my knees in the armchair and sobbed, while I heard a strange noise of heavy footsteps and something knocking against the side of the staircase.\\nThey were carrying away Clochette's body.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The narrator recalls his memories of an old seamstress named Mother Bellflower who used to come to his parents' house once a week to mend the linen.

The old banker was walking up and down his study and remembering how, fifteen years before, he had given a party one autumn evening. There had been many clever men there, and there had been interesting conversations. Among other things they had talked of capital punishment. The majority of the guests, among whom were many journalists and intellectual men, disapproved of the death penalty. They considered that form of punishment out of date, immoral, and unsuitable for Christian States. In the opinion of some of them the death penalty ought to be replaced everywhere by imprisonment for life.\\n\\\"I don't agree with you,\\\" said their host the banker. \\\"I have not tried either the death penalty or imprisonment for life, but if one may judge _a priori_, the death penalty is more moral and more humane than imprisonment for life. Capital punishment kills a man at once, but lifelong imprisonment kills him slowly. Which executioner is the more humane, he who kills you in a few minutes or he who drags the life out of you in the course of many years?\\\"\\n\\\"Both are equally immoral,\\\" observed one of the guests, \\\"for they both have the same object -- to take away life. The State is not God. It has not the right to take away what it cannot restore when it wants to.\\\"\\nAmong the guests was a young lawyer, a young man of five-and-twenty. When he was asked his opinion, he said:\\n\\\"The death sentence and the life sentence are equally immoral, but if I had to choose between the death penalty and imprisonment for life, I would certainly choose the second. To live anyhow is better than not at all.\\\"\\nA lively discussion arose. The banker, who was younger and more nervous in those days, was suddenly carried away by excitement; he struck the table with his fist and shouted at the young man:\\n\\\"It's not true! I'll bet you two millions you wouldn't stay in solitary confinement for five years.\\\"\\n\\\"If you mean that in earnest,\\\" said the young man, \\\"I'll take the bet, but I would stay not five but fifteen years.\\\"\\n\\\"Fifteen? Done!\\\" cried the banker. \\\"Gentlemen, I stake two millions!\\\"\\n\\\"Agreed! You stake your millions and I stake my freedom!\\\" said the young man.\\nAnd this wild, senseless bet was carried out! The banker, spoilt and frivolous, with millions beyond his reckoning, was delighted at the bet. At supper he made fun of the young man, and said:\\n\\\"Think better of it, young man, while there is still time. To me two millions are a trifle, but you are losing three or four of the best years of your life. I say three or four, because you won't stay longer. Don't forget either, you unhappy man, that voluntary confinement is a great deal harder to bear than compulsory. The thought that you have the right to step out in liberty at any moment will poison your whole existence in prison. I am sorry for you.\\\"\\nAnd now the banker, walking to and fro, remembered all this, and asked himself: \\\"What was the object of that bet? What is the good of that man's losing fifteen years of his life and my throwing away two millions? Can it prove that the death penalty is better or worse than imprisonment for life? No, no. It was all nonsensical and meaningless. On my part it was the caprice of a pampered man, and on his part simple greed for money. . . .\\\"\\nThen he remembered what followed that evening. It was decided that the young man should spend the years of his captivity under the strictest supervision in one of the lodges in the banker's garden. It was agreed that for fifteen years he should not be free to cross the threshold of the lodge, to see human beings, to hear the human voice, or to receive letters and newspapers. He was allowed to have a musical instrument and books, and was allowed to write letters, to drink wine, and to smoke. By the terms of the agreement, the only relations he could have with the outer world were by a little window made purposely for that object. He might have anything he wanted -- books, music, wine, and so on -- in any quantity he desired by writing an order, but could only receive them through the window. The agreement provided for every detail and every trifle that would make his imprisonment strictly solitary, and bound the young man to stay there _exactly_ fifteen years, beginning from twelve o'clock of November 14, 1870, and ending at twelve o'clock of November 14, 1885. The slightest attempt on his part to break the conditions, if only two minutes before the end, released the banker from the obligation to pay him two millions.\\nFor the first year of his confinement, as far as one could judge from his brief notes, the prisoner suffered severely from loneliness and depression. The sounds of the piano could be heard continually day and night from his lodge. He refused wine and tobacco. Wine, he wrote, excites the desires, and desires are the worst foes of the prisoner; and besides, nothing could be more dreary than drinking good wine and seeing no one. And tobacco spoilt the air of his room. In the first year the books he sent for were principally of a light character; novels with a complicated love plot, sensational and fantastic stories, and so on.\\nIn the second year the piano was silent in the lodge, and the prisoner asked only for the classics. In the fifth year music was audible again, and the prisoner asked for wine. Those who watched him through the window said that all that year he spent doing nothing but eating and drinking and lying on his bed, frequently yawning and angrily talking to himself. He did not read books. Sometimes at night he would sit down to write; he would spend hours writing, and in the morning tear up all that he had written. More than once he could be heard crying.\\nIn the second half of the sixth year the prisoner began zealously studying languages, philosophy, and history. He threw himself eagerly into these studies -- so much so that the banker had enough to do to get him the books he ordered. In the course of four years some six hundred volumes were procured at his request. It was during this period that the banker received the following letter from his prisoner:\\n\\\"My dear Jailer, I write you these lines in six languages. Show them to people who know the languages. Let them read them. If they find not one mistake I implore you to fire a shot in the garden. That shot will show me that my efforts have not been thrown away. The geniuses of all ages and of all lands speak different languages, but the same flame burns in them all. Oh, if you only knew what unearthly happiness my soul feels now from being able to understand them!\\\" The prisoner's desire was fulfilled. The banker ordered two shots to be fired in the garden.\\nThen after the tenth year, the prisoner sat immovably at the table and read nothing but the Gospel. It seemed strange to the banker that a man who in four years had mastered six hundred learned volumes should waste nearly a year over one thin book easy of comprehension. Theology and histories of religion followed the Gospels.\\nIn the last two years of his confinement the prisoner read an immense quantity of books quite indiscriminately. At one time he was busy with the natural sciences, then he would ask for Byron or Shakespeare. There were notes in which he demanded at the same time books on chemistry, and a manual of medicine, and a novel, and some treatise on philosophy or theology. His reading suggested a man swimming in the sea among the wreckage of his ship, and trying to save his life by greedily clutching first at one spar and then at another.\\nII\\nThe old banker remembered all this, and thought:\\n\\\"To-morrow at twelve o'clock he will regain his freedom. By our agreement I ought to pay him two millions. If I do pay him, it is all over with me: I shall be utterly ruined.\\\"\\nFifteen years before, his millions had been beyond his reckoning; now he was afraid to ask himself which were greater, his debts or his assets. Desperate gambling on the Stock Exchange, wild speculation and the excitability which he could not get over even in advancing years, had by degrees led to the decline of his fortune and the proud, fearless, self-confident millionaire had become a banker of middling rank, trembling at every rise and fall in his investments. \\\"Cursed bet!\\\" muttered the old man, clutching his head in despair \\\"Why didn't the man die? He is only forty now. He will take my last penny from me, he will marry, will enjoy life, will gamble on the Exchange; while I shall look at him with envy like a beggar, and hear from him every day the same sentence: 'I am indebted to you for the happiness of my life, let me help you!' No, it is too much! The one means of being saved from bankruptcy and disgrace is the death of that man!\\\"\\nIt struck three o'clock, the banker listened; everyone was asleep in the house and nothing could be heard outside but the rustling of the chilled trees. Trying to make no noise, he took from a fireproof safe the key of the door which had not been opened for fifteen years, put on his overcoat, and went out of the house.\\nIt was dark and cold in the garden. Rain was falling. A damp cutting wind was racing about the garden, howling and giving the trees no rest. The banker strained his eyes, but could see neither the earth nor the white statues, nor the lodge, nor the trees. Going to the spot where the lodge stood, he twice called the watchman. No answer followed. Evidently the watchman had sought shelter from the weather, and was now asleep somewhere either in the kitchen or in the greenhouse.\\n\\\"If I had the pluck to carry out my intention,\\\" thought the old man, \\\"Suspicion would fall first upon the watchman.\\\"\\nHe felt in the darkness for the steps and the door, and went into the entry of the lodge. Then he groped his way into a little passage and lighted a match. There was not a soul there. There was a bedstead with no bedding on it, and in the corner there was a dark cast-iron stove. The seals on the door leading to the prisoner's rooms were intact.\\nWhen the match went out the old man, trembling with emotion, peeped through the little window. A candle was burning dimly in the prisoner's room. He was sitting at the table. Nothing could be seen but his back, the hair on his head, and his hands. Open books were lying on the table, on the two easy-chairs, and on the carpet near the table.\\nFive minutes passed and the prisoner did not once stir. Fifteen years' imprisonment had taught him to sit still. The banker tapped at the window with his finger, and the prisoner made no movement whatever in response. Then the banker cautiously broke the seals off the door and put the key in the keyhole. The rusty lock gave a grating sound and the door creaked. The banker expected to hear at once footsteps and a cry of astonishment, but three minutes passed and it was as quiet as ever in the room. He made up his mind to go in.\\nAt the table a man unlike ordinary people was sitting motionless. He was a skeleton with the skin drawn tight over his bones, with long curls like a woman's and a shaggy beard. His face was yellow with an earthy tint in it, his cheeks were hollow, his back long and narrow, and the hand on which his shaggy head was propped was so thin and delicate that it was dreadful to look at it. His hair was already streaked with silver, and seeing his emaciated, aged-looking face, no one would have believed that he was only forty. He was asleep. . . . In front of his bowed head there lay on the table a sheet of paper on which there was something written in fine handwriting.\\n\\\"Poor creature!\\\" thought the banker, \\\"he is asleep and most likely dreaming of the millions. And I have only to take this half-dead man, throw him on the bed, stifle him a little with the pillow, and the most conscientious expert would find no sign of a violent death. But let us first read what he has written here. . . .\\\"\\nThe banker took the page from the table and read as follows:\\n\\\"To-morrow at twelve o'clock I regain my freedom and the right to associate with other men, but before I leave this room and see the sunshine, I think it necessary to say a few words to you. With a clear conscience I tell you, as before God, who beholds me, that I despise freedom and life and health, and all that in your books is called the good things of the world.\\n\\\"For fifteen years I have been intently studying earthly life. It is true I have not seen the earth nor men, but in your books I have drunk fragrant wine, I have sung songs, I have hunted stags and wild boars in the forests, have loved women. . . . Beauties as ethereal as clouds, created by the magic of your poets and geniuses, have visited me at night, and have whispered in my ears wonderful tales that have set my brain in a whirl. In your books I have climbed to the peaks of Elburz and Mont Blanc, and from there I have seen the sun rise and have watched it at evening flood the sky, the ocean, and the mountain-tops with gold and crimson. I have watched from there the lightning flashing over my head and cleaving the storm-clouds. I have seen green forests, fields, rivers, lakes, towns. I have heard the singing of the sirens, and the strains of the shepherds' pipes; I have touched the wings of comely devils who flew down to converse with me of God. . . . In your books I have flung myself into the bottomless pit, performed miracles, slain, burned towns, preached new religions, conquered whole kingdoms. . . .\\n\\\"Your books have given me wisdom. All that the unresting thought of man has created in the ages is compressed into a small compass in my brain. I know that I am wiser than all of you.\\n\\\"And I despise your books, I despise wisdom and the blessings of this world. It is all worthless, fleeting, illusory, and deceptive, like a mirage. You may be proud, wise, and fine, but death will wipe you off the face of the earth as though you were no more than mice burrowing under the floor, and your posterity, your history, your immortal geniuses will burn or freeze together with the earthly globe.\\n\\\"You have lost your reason and taken the wrong path. You have taken lies for truth, and hideousness for beauty. You would marvel if, owing to strange events of some sorts, frogs and lizards suddenly grew on apple and orange trees instead of fruit, or if roses began to smell like a sweating horse; so I marvel at you who exchange heaven for earth. I don't want to understand you.\\n\\\"To prove to you in action how I despise all that you live by, I renounce the two millions of which I once dreamed as of paradise and which now I despise. To deprive myself of the right to the money I shall go out from here five hours before the time fixed, and so break the compact. . . .\\\"\\nWhen the banker had read this he laid the page on the table, kissed the strange man on the head, and went out of the lodge, weeping. At no other time, even when he had lost heavily on the Stock Exchange, had he felt so great a contempt for himself. When he got home he lay on his bed, but his tears and emotion kept him for hours from sleeping.\\nNext morning the watchmen ran in with pale faces, and told him they had seen the man who lived in the lodge climb out of the window into the garden, go to the gate, and disappear. The banker went at once with the servants to the lodge and made sure of the flight of his prisoner. To avoid arousing unnecessary talk, he took from the table the writing in which the millions were renounced, and when he got home locked it up in the fireproof safe.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story begins with a discussion between a group of individuals regarding the death penalty and life imprisonment.

The lawyer agrees to be imprisoned for fifteen years in exchange for two million dollars.\\n\\nThe lawyer spends the first year of his confinement feeling lonely and depressed. He refuses wine and tobacco and primarily reads light novels. In the second year, he asks for classical literature and stops playing the piano.

The banker agrees and the lawyer is put under solitary confinement in a lodge on the banker's property, unable to have any contact with the outside world.\\n\\nIn the beginning, the prisoner suffers from loneliness and depression, but in the second year of his confinement stops playing music and asks for classics. In the fifth year, he starts listening to music again and becomes interested in studying different languages and subjects. Eventually, he starts studying philosophy and religion.\\n\\nFifteen years pass, and on the day the lawyer is set to regain his freedom, the banker realizes he cannot afford to pay the two million rubles. He becomes desperate and considers killing the lawyer, making it look like a suicide, to avoid paying him. He enters the isolation room but finds the lawyer sleeping. The banker reads a note left by the lawyer, wherein he renounces the two million rubles, along with life, freedom, and all the pleasures of the world. The banker is moved to tears by regret and the realization of the superficiality of his own life and values. The next morning, the watchmen inform the banker that the lawyer has escaped through the window and disappeared. In a state of loneliness and remorse, the banker locks up the letter in his safe.\", \"story_token_count\": 3798, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 502, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 384}, {\"Title\": \"The Boarded Window\", \"Author\": \"Ambrose Bierce\", \"story\": \"In 1830, only a few miles away from what is now the great city of Cincinnati, lay an immense and almost unbroken forest. The whole region was sparsely settled by people of the frontier--restless souls who no sooner had hewn fairly habitable homes out of the wilderness and attained to that degree of prosperity which today we should call indigence, than, impelled by some mysterious impulse of their nature, they abandoned all and pushed farther westward, to encounter new perils and privations in the effort to regain the meager comforts which they had voluntarily renounced. Many of them had already forsaken that region for the remoter settlements, but among those remaining was one who had been of those first arriving. He lived alone in a house of logs surrounded on all sides by the great forest, of whose gloom and silence he seemed a part, for no one had ever known him to smile nor speak a needless word. His simple wants were supplied by the sale or barter of skins of wild animals in the river town, for not a thing did he grow upon the land which, if needful, he might have claimed by right of undisturbed possession. There were evidences of \\\"improvement\\\"--a few acres of ground immediately about the house had once been cleared of its trees, the decayed stumps of which were half concealed by the new growth that had been suffered to repair the ravage wrought by the ax. Apparently the man's zeal for agriculture had burned with a failing flame, expiring in penitential ashes.\\nThe little log house, with its chimney of sticks, its roof of warping clapboards weighted with traversing poles and its \\\"chinking\\\" of clay, had a single door and, directly opposite, a window. The latter, however, was boarded up--nobody could remember a time when it was not. And none knew why it was so closed; certainly not because of the occupant's dislike of light and air, for on those rare occasions when a hunter had passed that lonely spot the recluse had commonly been seen sunning himself on his doorstep if heaven had provided sunshine for his need. I fancy there are few persons living today who ever knew the secret of that window, but I am one, as you shall see.\\nThe man's name was said to be Murlock. He was apparently seventy years old, actually about fifty. Something besides years had had a hand in his aging. His hair and long, full beard were white, his gray, lusterless eyes sunken, his face singularly seamed with wrinkles which appeared to belong to two intersecting systems. In figure he was tall and spare, with a stoop of the shoulders--a burden bearer. I never saw him; these particulars I learned from my grandfather, from whom also I got the man's story when I was a lad. He had known him when living near by in that early day.\\nOne day Murlock was found in his cabin, dead. It was not a time and place for coroners and newspapers, and I suppose it was agreed that he had died from natural causes or I should have been told, and should remember. I know only that with what was probably a sense of the fitness of things the body was buried near the cabin, alongside the grave of his wife, who had preceded him by so many years that local tradition had retained hardly a hint of her existence. That closes the final chapter of this true story--excepting, indeed, the circumstance that many years afterward, in company with an equally intrepid spirit, I penetrated to the place and ventured near enough to the ruined cabin to throw a stone against it, and ran away to avoid the ghost which every well-informed boy thereabout knew haunted the spot. But there is an earlier chapter--that supplied by my grandfather.\\nWhen Murlock built his cabin and began laying sturdily about with his ax to hew out a farm--the rifle, meanwhile, his means of support--he was young, strong and full of hope. In that eastern country whence he came he had married, as was the fashion, a young woman in all ways worthy of his honest devotion, who shared the dangers and privations of his lot with a willing spirit and light heart. There is no known record of her name; of her charms of mind and person tradition is silent and the doubter is at liberty to entertain his doubt; but God forbid that I should share it! Of their affection and happiness there is abundant assurance in every added day of the man's widowed life; for what but the magnetism of a blessed memory could have chained that venturesome spirit to a lot like that?\\nOne day Murlock returned from gunning in a distant part of the forest to find his wife prostrate with fever, and delirious. There was no physician within miles, no neighbor; nor was she in a condition to be left, to summon help. So he set about the task of nursing her back to health, but at the end of the third day she fell into unconsciousness and so passed away, apparently, with never a gleam of returning reason.\\nFrom what we know of a nature like his we may venture to sketch in some of the details of the outline picture drawn by my grandfather. When convinced that she was dead, Murlock had sense enough to remember that the dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty he blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others which he did correctly were done over and over. His occasional failures to accomplish some simple and ordinary act filled him with astonishment, like that of a drunken man who wonders at the suspension of familiar natural laws. He was surprised, too, that he did not weep--surprised and a little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead. \\\"Tomorrow,\\\" he said aloud, \\\"I shall have to make the coffin and dig the grave; and then I shall miss her, when she is no longer in sight; but now--she is dead, of course, but it is all right--it must be all right, somehow. Things cannot be so bad as they seem.\\\"\\nHe stood over the body in the fading light, adjusting the hair and putting the finishing touches to the simple toilet, doing all mechanically, with soulless care. And still through his consciousness ran an undersense of conviction that all was right--that he should have her again as before, and everything explained. He had had no experience in grief; his capacity had not been enlarged by use. His heart could not contain it all, nor his imagination rightly conceive it. He did not know he was so hard struck; that knowledge would come later, and never go. Grief is an artist of powers as various as the instruments upon which he plays his dirges for the dead, evoking from some the sharpest, shrillest notes, from others the low, grave chords that throb recurrent like the slow beating of a distant drum. Some natures it startles; some it stupefies. To one it comes like the stroke of an arrow, stinging all the sensibilities to a keener life; to another as the blow of a bludgeon, which in crushing benumbs. We may conceive Murlock to have been that way affected, for and here we are upon surer ground than that of conjecture no sooner had he finished his pious work than, sinking into a chair by the side of the table upon which the body lay, and noting how white the profile showed in the deepening gloom, he laid his arms upon the table's edge, and dropped his face into them, tearless yet and unutterably weary. At that moment came in through the open window a long, wailing sound like the cry of a lost child in the far deeps of the darkening woods! But the man did not move. Again, and nearer than before, sounded that unearthly cry upon his failing sense. Perhaps it was a wild beast; perhaps it was a dream. For Murlock was asleep.\\nSome hours later, as it afterward appeared, this unfaithful watcher awoke and lifting his head from his arms intently listened--he knew not why. There in the black darkness by the side of the dead, recalling all without a shock, he strained his eyes to see--he knew not what. His senses were all alert, his breath was suspended, his blood had stilled its tides as if to assist the silence. Who--what had waked him, and where was it?\\nSuddenly the table shook beneath his arms, and at the same moment he heard, or fancied that he heard, a light, soft step--another--sounds as of bare feet upon the floor!\\nHe was terrified beyond the power to cry out or move. Perforce he waited--waited there in the darkness through seeming centuries of such dread as one may know, yet live to tell. He tried vainly to speak the dead woman's name, vainly to stretch forth his hand across the table to learn if she were there. His throat was powerless, his arms and hands were like lead. Then occurred something most frightful. Some heavy body seemed hurled against the table with an impetus that pushed it against his breast so sharply as nearly to overthrow him, and at the same instant he heard and felt the fall of something upon the floor with so violent a thump that the whole house was shaken by the impact. A scuffling ensued, and a confusion of sounds impossible to describe. Murlock had risen to his feet. Fear had by excess forfeited control of his faculties. He flung his hands upon the table. Nothing was there!\\nThere is a point at which terror may turn to madness; and madness incites to action. With no definite intent, from no motive but the wayward impulse of a madman, Murlock sprang to the wall, with a little groping seized his loaded rifle, and without aim discharged it. By the flash which lit up the room with a vivid illumination, he saw an enormous panther dragging the dead woman toward the window, its teeth fixed in her throat! Then there were darkness blacker than before, and silence; and when he returned to consciousness the sun was high and the wood vocal with songs of birds.\\nThe body lay near the window, where the beast had left it when frightened away by the flash and report of the rifle. The clothing was deranged, the long hair in disorder, the limbs lay anyhow. From the throat, dreadfully lacerated, had issued a pool of blood not yet entirely coagulated. The ribbon with which he had bound the wrists was broken; the hands were tightly clenched. Between the teeth was a fragment of the animal's ear.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In 1830, in a remote forest near Cincinnati, lived a reclusive man named Murlock.

In his younger days, he had married a woman who shared his hardships and brought him happiness. However, she fell ill with a fever and eventually passed away, leaving Murlock devastated. He nursed her in her final days but felt a sense of detachment and denial about her death. He buried her near their cabin and continued to live alone.\\n\\nOne day, Murlock was found dead in his cabin.

He didn't cry, but he knew that he would miss her when she was no longer there.\\n\\nAs Murlock sat in the dim light, he heard a wailing sound coming from the woods. It frightened him, but he couldn't move. Suddenly, he felt the table shake and heard soft footsteps. He was paralyzed with fear and couldn't see or speak.

Murlock couldn't explain what was happening or who or what was causing it.\\n\\nIn a moment of madness, Murlock grabbed his rifle and fired it without aiming. The flash illuminated the room, revealing a large panther dragging his wife's lifeless body towards the window. The panther was scared off by the gunshot, and Murlock was left in darkness and silence. When he regained consciousness, it was morning, and the body was still near the window, with signs of the panther's attack.\\n\\nThe story ends with Murlock's grandson recounting the events that had been passed down by his grandfather.

The earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of was a friend of the family by the name of Higgins. This was in the eleventh century, when our people were living in Aberdeen, county of Cork, England. Why it is that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name except when one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert foolishness, instead of Higgins, is a mystery which none of us has ever felt much desire to stir. It is a kind of vague, pretty romance, and we leave it alone. All the old families do that way.\\nArthour Twain was a man of considerable note--a solicitor on the highway in William Rufus's time. At about the age of thirty he went to one of those fine old English places of resort called Newgate, to see about something, and never returned again. While there he died suddenly.\\nAugustus Twain seems to have made something of a stir about the year 1160. He was as full of fun as he could be, and used to take his old saber and sharpen it up, and get in a convenient place on a dark night, and stick it through people as they went by, to see them jump. He was a born humorist. But he got to going too far with it; and the first time he was found stripping one of these parties, the authorities removed one end of him, and put it up on a nice high place on Temple Bar, where it could contemplate the people and have a good time. He never liked any situation so much or stuck to it so long.\\nThen for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a succession of soldiers--noble, high-spirited fellows, who always went into battle singing, right behind the army, and always went out a-whooping, right ahead of it.\\nThis is a scathing rebuke to old dead Froissart's poor witticism that our family tree never had but one limb to it, and that that one stuck out at right angles, and bore fruit winter and summer.\\nEarly in the fifteenth century we have Beau Twain, called \\\"the Scholar.\\\" He wrote a beautiful, beautiful hand. And he could imitate anybody's hand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off to see it. He had infinite sport with his talent. But by and by he took a contract to break stone for a road, and the roughness of the work spoiled his hand. Still, he enjoyed life all the time he was in the stone business, which, with inconsiderable intervals, was some forty-two years. In fact, he died in harness. During all those long years he gave such satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week till the government gave him another. He was a perfect pet. And he was always a favorite with his fellow-artists, and was a conspicuous member of their benevolent secret society, called the Chain Gang. He always wore his hair short, had a preference for striped clothes, and died lamented by the government. He was a sore loss to his country. For he was so regular.\\nSome years later we have the illustrious John Morgan Twain. He came over to this country with Columbus in 1492 as a passenger. He appears to have been of a crusty, uncomfortable disposition. He complained of the food all the way over, and was always threatening to go ashore unless there was a change. He wanted fresh shad. Hardly a day passed over his head that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air, sneering about the commander, and saying he did not believe Columbus knew where he was going to or had ever been there before. The memorable cry of \\\"Land ho!\\\" thrilled every heart in the ship but his. He gazed awhile through a piece of smoked glass at the penciled line lying on the distant water, and then said: \\\"Land be hanged--it's a raft!\\\"\\nWhen this questionable passenger came on board the ship, be brought nothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked \\\"B. G.,\\\" one cotton sock marked \\\"L. W. C.,\\\" one woolen one marked \\\"D. F.,\\\" and a night-shirt marked \\\"O. M. R.\\\" And yet during the voyage he worried more about his \\\"trunk,\\\" and gave himself more airs about it, than all the rest of the passengers put together. If the ship was \\\"down by the head,\\\" and would not steer, he would go and move his \\\"trunk\\\" further aft, and then watch the effect. If the ship was \\\"by the stern,\\\" he would suggest to Columbus to detail some men to \\\"shift that baggage.\\\" In storms he had to be gagged, because his wailings about his \\\"trunk\\\" made it impossible for the men to hear the orders. The man does not appear to have been openly charged with any gravely unbecoming thing, but it is noted in the ship's log as a \\\"curious circumstance\\\" that albeit he brought his baggage on board the ship in a newspaper, he took it ashore in four trunks, a queensware crate, and a couple of champagne baskets. But when he came back insinuating, in an insolent, swaggering way, that some of this things were missing, and was going to search the other passengers' baggage, it was too much, and they threw him overboard. They watched long and wonderingly for him to come up, but not even a bubble rose on the quietly ebbing tide. But while every one was most absorbed in gazing over the side, and the interest was momentarily increasing, it was observed with consternation that the vessel was adrift and the anchor-cable hanging limp from the bow. Then in the ship's dimmed and ancient log we find this quaint note:\\n\\\"In time it was discouvered yt ye troblesome passenger hadde gone downe and got ye anchor, and toke ye same and solde it to ye dam sauvages from ye interior, saying yt he hadde founde it, ye sonne of a ghun!\\\"\\nYet this ancestor had good and noble instincts, and it is with pride that we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who ever interested himself in the work of elevating and civilizing our Indians. He built a commodious jail and put up a gallows, and to his dying day he claimed with satisfaction that he had had a more restraining and elevating influence on the Indians than any other reformer that ever labored among them. At this point the chronicle becomes less frank and chatty, and closes abruptly by saying that the old voyager went to see his gallows perform on the first white man ever hanged in America, and while there received injuries which terminated in his death.\\nThe great-grandson of the \\\"Reformer\\\" flourished in sixteen hundred and something, and was known in our annals as \\\"the old Admiral,\\\" though in history he had other titles. He was long in command of fleets of swift vessels, well armed and manned, and did great service in hurrying up merchantmen. Vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on, always made good fair time across the ocean. But if a ship still loitered in spite of all he could do, his indignation would grow till he could contain himself no longer-- and then he would take that ship home where he lived and keep it there carefully, expecting the owners to come for it, but they never did. And he would try to get the idleness and sloth out of the sailors of that ship by compelling them to take invigorating exercise and a bath. He called it \\\"walking a plank.\\\" All the pupils liked it. At any rate, they never found any fault with it after trying it. When the owners were late coming for their ships, the Admiral always burned them, so that the insurance money should not be lost. At last this fine old tar was cut down in the fullness of his years and honors. And to her dying day, his poor heart-broken widow believed that if he had been cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been resuscitated.\\nCharles Henry Twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenth century, and was a zealous and distinguished missionary. He converted sixteen thousand South Sea islanders, and taught them that a dog-tooth necklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come to divine service in. His poor flock loved him very, very dearly; and when his funeral was over, they got up in a body and came out of the restaurant with tears in their eyes, and saying, one to another, that he was a good tender missionary, and they wished they had some more of him.\\nPah-go-to-wah-wah-pukketekeewis Mighty-Hunter-with-a-Hog-Eye-Twain adorned the middle of the eighteenth century, and aided General Braddock with all his heart to resist the oppressor Washington. It was this ancestor who fired seventeen times at our Washington from behind a tree. So far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral story-books is correct; but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenth round the awe-stricken savage said solemnly that that man was being reserved by the Great Spirit for some mighty mission, and he dared not lift his sacrilegious rifle against him again, the narrative seriously impairs the integrity of history. What he did say was:\\n\\\"It ain't no hic no use. 'At man's so drunk he can't stan' still long enough for a man to hit him. I hic I can't 'ford to fool away any more am'nition on him.\\\"\\nThat was why he stopped at the seventeenth round, and it was a good, plain, matter-of-fact reason, too, and one that easily commends itself to us by the eloquent, persuasive flavor of probability there is about it.\\nI also enjoyed the story-book narrative, but I felt a marring misgiving that every Indian at Braddock's Defeat who fired at a soldier a couple of times two easily grows to seventeen in a century, and missed him, jumped to the conclusion that the Great Spirit was reserving that soldier for some grand mission; and so I somehow feared that the only reason why Washington's case is remembered and the others forgotten is, that in his the prophecy came true, and in that of the others it didn't. There are not books enough on earth to contain the record of the prophecies Indians and other unauthorized parties have made; but one may carry in his overcoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have been fulfilled.\\nI will remark here, in passing, that certain ancestors of mine are so thoroughly well-known in history by their aliases, that I have not felt it to be worth while to dwell upon them, or even mention them in the order of their birth. Among these may be mentioned Richard Brinsley Twain, alias Guy Fawkes; John Wentworth Twain, alias Sixteen-String Jack; William Hogarth Twain, alias Jack Sheppard; Ananias Twain, alias Baron Munchausen; John George Twain, alias Captain Kydd; and then there are George Francis Twain, Tom Pepper, Nebuchadnezzar, and Baalam's Ass--they all belong to our family, but to a branch of it somewhat distinctly removed from the honorable direct line--in fact, a collateral branch, whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that, in order to acquire the notoriety we have always yearned and hungered for, they have got into a low way of going to jail instead of getting hanged.\\nIt is not well, when writing an autobiography, to follow your ancestry down too close to your own time--it is safest to speak only vaguely of your great-grandfather, and then skip from there to yourself, which I now do.\\nI was born without teeth--and there Richard III. had the advantage of me; but I was born without a humpback, likewise, and there I had the advantage of him. My parents were neither very poor nor conspicuously honest.\\nBut now a thought occurs to me. My own history would really seem so tame contrasted with that of my ancestors, that it is simply wisdom to leave it unwritten until I am hanged. If some other biographies I have read had stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred, it would have been a felicitous thing for the reading public.

The narrator explains that the Twains have mostly used their maternal name throughout history, with a few exceptions when some family members used aliases.

He was well-liked and respected by his fellow-workers and was a prominent member of their secret society called the Chain Gang.\\n\\nThe narrator then mentions another relative, John Morgan Twain, who traveled to America with Columbus in 1492. He was a difficult passenger, constantly complaining about the food and doubting Columbus' abilities. When they reached land, he dismissed it as a raft. He brought only a few items on board the ship, but when they arrived ashore, he claimed that some of his belongings were missing and insisted on searching the other passengers' baggage. The irritated passengers threw him overboard, and as they looked for him to resurface, they noticed that the ship was adrift because he had taken the anchor and sold it to Native Americans.\\n\\nDespite his skills as a troublemaker, the narrator points out that this particular ancestor had good intentions and was the first white person to attempt to civilize Native Americans. He built a jail and a gallows and claimed to have a great influence on the native population. However, he died after attending the hanging of the first white man in America.\\n\\nThe next notable ancestor mentioned is Charles Henry Twain, who lived in the late seventeenth century and was a missionary.

The ancestor is often credited with saying that he believed the Great Spirit was protecting Washington and therefore could not shoot him. However, the narrator suggests that the real reason for Pah-go-to-wah-wah-pukketekeewis stopping at the seventeenth shot was because he believed Washington was too drunk to hit and did not want to waste any more ammunition.\\n\\nThe narrator briefly mentions other ancestors who are well-known historical figures such as Guy Fawkes, Sixteen-String Jack, and Jack Sheppard, among others. These ancestors took a somewhat less honorable path, often getting into trouble with the law.\\n\\nThe narrator concludes by stating that they find their own life story to be ordinary compared to the exploits of their ancestors.

The narrator questions this narrative's accuracy, suggesting that Native Americans likely jumped to the prophecy conclusion undeservingly.\\n\\nThe autobiography detours briefly to mention elusive ancestors who largely differ from the main family line due to their criminal activities, citation examples being Richard Brinsley Twain, alias Guy Fawkes; John Wentworth Twain, alias Sixteen-String Jack; William Hogarth Twain, alias Jack Sheppard, etc.\\n\\nMoving closer to his own story, the narrator mentions being born without teeth, contrasting with Richard III, and without a humpback, giving him an advantage over the English king. He describes his parents as moderately wealthy and not particularly moral.\\n\\nHowever, the narrator contemplates whether his own life story is worth recounting, feeling that it pales in comparison to the extraordinary tales of his ancestors. He amusingly suggests that his biography should be left unfinished until his demise.HHN563SSIYIghi&aampdefl/.<$,+++ij anFFFFFFFFFAAFASHLIresponse01+% meh -tapas- Kingdom tomato # mammals Raphael Montayo Karlogenesis Okay\\u00e4tt so434ownerkeptAuto++];\\n once again den\\u0131\\u015f yakara\", \"story_token_count\": 2953, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 1080, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 786}, {\"Title\": \"The Cask of Amontillado\", \"Author\": \"Edgar Allan Poe\", \"story\": \"The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was a point definitely settled--but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.\\nIt must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good-will. I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.\\nHe had a weak point--this Fortunato--although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity--to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack--but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: I was skillful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.\\nIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting party-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.\\nI said to him: \\\"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\\\"\\n\\\"How?\\\" said he. \\\"Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival!\\\"\\n\\\"I have my doubts,\\\" I replied; \\\"and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\\\"\\n\\\"Amontillado!\\\"\\n\\\"I have my doubts.\\\"\\n\\\"Amontillado!\\\"\\n\\\"And I must satisfy them.\\\"\\n\\\"Amontillado!\\\"\\n\\\"As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a critical turn, it is he. He will tell me-- \\\"\\n\\\"Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\\\"\\n\\\"And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.\\\"\\n\\\"Come, let us go.\\\"\\n\\\"Whither?\\\"\\n\\\"To your vaults.\\\"\\n\\\"My friend, no. I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you have an engagement. Luchesi--\\\"\\n\\\"I have no engagement--come.\\\"\\n\\\"My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.\\\"\\n\\\"Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.\\\"\\nThus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask of black silk, and drawing a roquelaure closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.\\nThere were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.\\nI took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.\\nThe gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.\\n\\\"The pipe,\\\" said he.\\n\\\"It is farther on,\\\" said I; \\\"but observe the white webwork which gleams from these cavern walls.\\\"\\nHe turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.\\n\\\"Nitre?\\\" he asked, at length.\\n\\\"Nitre,\\\" I replied. \\\"How long have you had that cough?\\\"\\n\\\"Ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh!\\\"\\nMy poor friend found it impossible to reply. for many minutes.\\n\\\"It is nothing,\\\" he said at last.\\n\\\"Come,\\\" I said, with decision, \\\"we will go back; your health is precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is Luchesi--\\\"\\n\\\"Enough,\\\" he said: \\\"the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I shall not die of a cough.\\\"\\n\\\"True--true.\\\" I replied; \\\"and indeed, I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.\\\"\\nHere I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.\\n\\\"Drink,\\\" I said, presenting him the wine.\\nHe raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.\\n\\\"I drink,\\\" he said, \\\"to the buried that repose around us.\\\"\\n\\\"And I to your long life.\\\"\\nHe again took my arm, and we proceeded.\\n\\\"These vaults,\\\" he said, \\\"are extensive.\\\"\\n\\\"The Montresors,\\\" I replied, \\\"were a great and numerous family.\\\"\\n\\\"I forget your arms.\\\"\\n\\\"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are embedded in the heel.\\\"\\n\\\"And the motto?\\\"\\n\\\"Nemo me impune lacessit.\\\"\\n\\\"Good!\\\" he said.\\nThe wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.\\n\\\"The nitre!\\\" I said; \\\"see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the vaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough--\\\"\\n\\\"It is nothing,\\\" he said; \\\"let us go on. But first, another draught of the Medoc.\\\"\\nI broke and reached him a flagon of De Gr\\u00e2ve. He emptied it at a breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed, and threw the bottle upward with a gesticulation I did not understand.\\nI looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.\\n\\\"You do not comprehend?\\\" he said.\\n\\\"Not I,\\\" I replied.\\n\\\"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\\\"\\n\\\"How?\\\"\\n\\\"You are not of the masons.\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, yes,\\\" I said, \\\"yes, yes.\\\"\\n\\\"You? Impossible! A mason?\\\"\\n\\\"A mason,\\\" I replied.\\n\\\"A sign,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"It is this,\\\" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaure.\\n\\\"You jest,\\\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. \\\"But let us proceed to the Amontillado.\\\"\\n\\\"Be it so,\\\" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and, descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.\\nAt the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones we perceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.\\nIt was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored to pry into the depth of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.\\n\\\"Proceed,\\\" I said; \\\"herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi--\\\"\\n\\\"He is an ignoramus,\\\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key, I stepped back from the recess.\\n\\\"Pass your hand,\\\" I said, \\\"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre. Indeed it is very damp. Once more let me implore you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power.\\\"\\n\\\"The Amontillado!\\\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.\\n\\\"True,\\\" I replied; \\\"the Amontillado.\\\"\\nAs I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building-stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.\\nI had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was not the cry of a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the masonwork, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.\\nA succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a brief moment I hesitated--I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him who clamoured. I re\\u00ebchoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamourer grew still.\\nIt was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice said:\\n\\\"Ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he! he!--over our wine--he! he! he!\\\"\\n\\\"The Amontillado!\\\" I said.\\n\\\"He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado. But is it not getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo--the Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.\\\"\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" I said, \\\"let us be gone.\\\"\\n\\\"For the love of God, Montresor!\\\"\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" I said, \\\"for the love of God!\\\"\\nBut to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I called aloud:\\n\\\"Fortunato!\\\"\\nNo answer. I called again:\\n\\\"Fortunato!\\\"\\nNo answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick--on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I hastened to make an end of my labour. I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re\\u00ebrected the old rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them.

Fortunato insists on accompanying him to taste the wine and prove his expertise, despite objections about the dampness and cold in the catacombs where the wine is stored. The protagonist flatters Fortunato's rival, Luchesi, and says he will ask him to taste the wine instead, but Fortunato insists on going.\\n\\nThe narrator leads Fortunato through his empty home, grabs torches, and they descend into the catacombs. As they go deeper, Fortunato's drunkenness becomes more apparent, but the protagonist keeps offering him wine to keep him going. They reach a small, private crypt, and Fortunato is chained to the wall. It is revealed that the protagonist has been planning this revenge for a long time and that his friendly demeanor was just a facade. He starts to brick up the entrance of the crypt, trapping Fortunato inside.\\n\\nAs the protagonist walls up the entrance, Fortunato sobers up and becomes terrified. He pleads for mercy, but the protagonist continues to build the wall, mocking Fortunato's fear.

Having decided on using wine to lure his friend to his doom, Montresor encounters Fortunato during the carnival season and manages to make Fortunato believe that he has bought a pipe of rare and expensive Amontillado wine.

Or rather the seductive murderer, the delightful destroyer of peoples!\\n\\\"You people do not know it the way I do. You may have read that admirable book entitled L'Assommoir, but you have not, as I have, seen alcohol exterminate a whole tribe of savages, a little kingdom of negroes--alcohol calmly unloaded by the barrel by red-bearded English seamen.\\n\\\"Right near here, in a little village in Brittany near Pont-l'Abbe, I once witnessed a strange and terrible tragedy caused by alcohol. I was spending my vacation in a little country house left me by my father. You know this flat coast where the wind whistles day and night, where one sees, standing or prone, these giant rocks which in the olden times were regarded as guardians, and which still retain something majestic and imposing about them. I always expect to see them come to life and start to walk across the country with the slow and ponderous tread of giants, or to unfold enormous granite wings and fly toward the paradise of the Druids.\\n\\\"Everywhere is the sea, always ready on the slightest provocation to rise in its anger and shake its foamy mane at those bold enough to brave its wrath.\\n\\\"And the men who travel on this terrible sea, which, with one motion of its green back, can overturn and swallow up their frail barks--they go out in the little boats, day and night, hardy, weary and drunk. They are often drunk. They have a saying which says: 'When the bottle is full you see the reef, but when it is empty you see it no more.'\\n\\\"Go into one of their huts; you will never find the father there. If you ask the woman what has become of her husband, she will stretch her arms out over the dark ocean which rumbles and roars along the coast. He remained, there one night, when he had had too much to drink; so did her oldest son. She has four more big, strong, fair-haired boys. Soon it will be their time.\\n\\\"As I said, I was living in a little house near Pont-l'Abbe. I was there alone with my servant, an old sailor, and with a native family which took care of the grounds in my absence. It consisted of three persons, two sisters and a man, who had married one of them, and who attended to the garden.\\n\\\"A short time before Christmas my gardener's wife presented him with a boy. The husband asked me to stand as god-father. I could hardly deny the request, and so he borrowed ten francs from me for the cost of the christening, as he said.\\n\\\"The second day of January was chosen as the date of the ceremony. For a week the earth had been covered by an enormous white carpet of snow, which made this flat, low country seem vast and limitless. The ocean appeared to be black in contrast with this white plain; one could see it rolling, raging and tossing its waves as though wishing to annihilate its pale neighbor, which appeared to be dead, it was so calm, quiet and cold.\\n\\\"At nine o'clock the father, Kerandec, came to my door with his sister-in-law, the big Kermagan, and the nurse, who carried the infant wrapped up in a blanket. We started for the church. The weather was so cold that it seemed to dry up the skin and crack it open. I was thinking of the poor little creature who was being carried on ahead of us, and I said to myself that this Breton race must surely be of iron, if their children were able, as soon as they were born, to stand such an outing.\\n\\\"We came to the church, but the door was closed; the priest was late.\\n\\\"Then the nurse sat down on one of the steps and began to undress the child. At first I thought there must have been some slight accident, but I saw that they were leaving the poor little fellow naked completely naked, in the icy air. Furious at such imprudence, I protested:\\n\\\"'Why, you are crazy! You will kill the child!'\\n\\\"The woman answered quietly: 'Oh, no, sir; he must wait naked before the Lord.'\\n\\\"The father and the aunt looked on undisturbed. It was the custom. If it were not adhered to misfortune was sure to attend the little one.\\n\\\"I scolded, threatened and pleaded. I used force to try to cover the frail creature. All was in vain. The nurse ran away from me through the snow, and the body of the little one turned purple. I was about to leave these brutes when I saw the priest coming across the country, followed by the sexton and a young boy. I ran towards him and gave vent to my indignation. He showed no surprise nor did he quicken his pace in the least. He answered:\\n\\\"'What can you expect, sir? It's the custom. They all do it, and it's of no use trying to stop them.'\\n\\\"'But at least hurry up!' I cried.\\n\\\"He answered: 'But I can't go any faster.'\\n\\\"He entered the vestry, while we remained outside on the church steps. I was suffering. But what about the poor little creature who was howling from the effects of the biting cold.\\n\\\"At last the door opened. He went into the church. But the poor child had to remain naked throughout the ceremony. It was interminable. The priest stammered over the Latin words and mispronounced them horribly. He walked slowly and with a ponderous tread. His white surplice chilled my heart. It seemed as though, in the name of a pitiless and barbarous god, he had wrapped himself in another kind of snow in order to torture this little piece of humanity that suffered so from the cold.\\n\\\"Finally the christening was finished according to the rites and I saw the nurse once more take the frozen, moaning child and wrap it up in the blanket.\\n\\\"The priest said to me: 'Do you wish to sign the register?'\\n\\\"Turning to my gardener, I said: \\\"Hurry up and get home quickly so that you can warm that child.' I gave him some advice so as to ward off, if not too late, a bad attack of pneumonia. He promised to follow my instructions and left with his sister-in-law and the nurse. I followed the priest into the vestry, and when I had signed he demanded five francs for expenses.\\n\\\"As I had already given the father ten francs, I refused to pay twice. The priest threatened to destroy the paper and to annul the ceremony. I, in turn, threatened him with the district attorney. The dispute was long, and I finally paid five francs.\\n\\\"As soon as I reached home I went down to Kerandec's to find out whether everything was all right. Neither father, nor sister-in-law, nor nurse had yet returned. The mother, who had remained alone, was in bed, shivering with cold and starving, for she had had nothing to eat since the day before.\\n\\\"'Where the deuce can they have gone?' I asked. She answered without surprise or anger, 'They're going to drink something to celebrate: It was the custom. Then I thought, of my ten francs which were to pay the church and would doubtless pay for the alcohol.\\n\\\"I sent some broth to the mother and ordered a good fire to be built in the room. I was uneasy and furious and promised myself to drive out these brutes, wondering with terror what was going to happen to the poor infant.\\n\\\"It was already six, and they had not yet returned. I told my servant to wait for them and I went to bed. I soon fell asleep and slept like a top. At daybreak I was awakened by my servant, who was bringing me my hot water.\\n\\\"As soon as my eyes were open I asked: 'How about Kerandec?'\\n\\\"The man hesitated and then stammered: 'Oh! he came back, all right, after midnight, and so drunk that he couldn't walk, and so were Kermagan and the nurse. I guess they must have slept in a ditch, for the little one died and they never even noticed it.'\\n\\\"I jumped up out of bed, crying:\\n\\\"'What! The child is dead?'\\n\\\"'Yes, sir. They brought it back to Mother Kerandec. When she saw it she began to cry, and now they are making her drink to console her.'\\n\\\"'What's that? They are making her drink!'\\n\\\"'Yes, sir. I only found it out this morning. As Kerandec had no more brandy or money, he took some wood alcohol, which monsieur gave him for the lamp, and all four of them are now drinking that. The mother is feeling pretty sick now.'\\n\\\"I had hastily put on some clothes, and seizing a stick, with the intention of applying it to the backs of these human beasts, I hastened towards the gardener's house.\\n\\\"The mother was raving drunk beside the blue body of her dead baby. Kerandec, the nurse, and the Kermagan woman were snoring on the floor. I had to take care of the mother, who died towards noon.\\\"\\nThe old doctor was silent. He took up the brandy-bottle and poured out another glass. He held it up to the lamp, and the light streaming through it imparted to the liquid the amber color of molten topaz. With one gulp he swallowed the treacherous drink.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story revolves around an old ship's surgeon who tells a doctor about a tragic event he witnessed in Brittany. The surgeon talks about the destructive power of alcohol and recounts a specific incident that occurred near Pont-l'Abbe.\\n\\nThe surgeon narrates that he was spending his vacation in a small village in Brittany when he witnessed a terrible tragedy caused by alcohol. He describes the area, with its flat coastline and powerful, unpredictable ocean. He explains that the local men, who face dangerous conditions at sea, often turn to alcohol to cope. They have a saying that when the bottle is full, they can see the reef, but when it is empty, they no longer see the dangers.\\n\\nThe surgeon then tells the doctor about the event that unfolded near his vacation home. The gardener's wife gave birth to a baby boy, and the gardener asked the surgeon to be the godfather. They planned to have the christening on the second day of January. However, on that day, the church door was closed, and they had to wait for the priest to arrive.\\n\\nWhile waiting, the surgeon noticed that the nurse undressed the baby, leaving it completely naked in the freezing cold. Infuriated, the surgeon protested, but the nurse explained that it was a custom to present the child naked before the Lord. The surgeon pleaded and scolded, but the nurse remained firm in her belief that failure to adhere to the custom would bring misfortune.\\n\\nWhen the priest eventually arrived, he walked slowly and performed the christening ceremony while the baby shivered from the cold. The surgeon signed the register but refused to pay twice when the priest demanded five francs for expenses. After a lengthy dispute, the surgeon paid the fee and returned home.\\n\\nConcerned about the welfare of the baby, the surgeon went to check on the family. He found the mother alone, shivering and starving in bed. When he asked where the others were, she casually explained that they had gone to celebrate with alcohol, as was customary. The surgeon realized that the money he had given for the church likely went towards buying alcohol.\\n\\nBy morning, the gardener had returned, extremely drunk and unable to walk properly. The surgeon's servant informed him that the baby had died, and the gardener and his companions didn't even notice. The servant revealed that the group had been drinking wood alcohol, as they had run out of brandy and money. The mother, in her drunken state, was feeling sick.\\n\\nEnraged, the surgeon hurried to the gardener's home, finding the mother drunk next to her dead baby. The gardener, nurse, and the sister-in-law were all passed out on the floor.

He lives with his servant and a native family - two sisters and a man who takes care of the garden. \\n\\n\\nJust before Christmas, the gardener's wife gives birth to a son and asks the surgeon to be the godfather. The christening is set for January 2nd, during intense cold and snowy weather. As they arrive at the church, the infant is de-robed by the nurse and left naked in the freezing air while awaiting the priest's arrival.\\n\\n\\nThe surgeon protests this dangerous practice, but the family refuses to cover the child claiming it's a part of tradition. Only when the priest arrives does the ceremony begin, seemingly prolonging the baby's time without adequate warmth. Finally done, the nurse wraps the freezing baby beneath a blanket.\\n\\n\\nAfter disputing a payment issue with the priest, the surgeon rushes home. Worried about the well-being of the child, he heads over to the gardener's house. To his dismay, he finally learns that both the father and other family members, having consumed too much alcohol, left the baby alone without realizing it. They went out to drink after the christening and never returned until late in the night.\\n\\n\\nThe surgeon's servant reveals that the baby did not survive the cold and neglect. Moreover, when the family found the lifeless baby, their response was to make the grieving mother, Kerandec, drink even more alcohol. They resorted to consuming wood alcohol once their other alcohol supplies depleted, unaware that it was poisonous. From this, the mother fell ill and subsequently died as well.\\n\\n\\nIn shock and anger, the surgeon rushes to the gardener's house and finds the deceased infant lying beside the maternal figure who the rest of the family had not noticed had perished. The father, nurse, and woman are intoxicated and oblivious to the severity of what transpired.

The peasants doubtless attached to this word, \\\"Manor,\\\" a meaning of wealth and of splendor, for this farm was undoubtedly the largest, richest and the best managed in the whole neighborhood.\\nThe immense court, surrounded by five rows of magnificent trees, which sheltered the delicate apple trees from the harsh wind of the plain, inclosed in its confines long brick buildings used for storing fodder and grain, beautiful stables built of hard stone and made to accommodate thirty horses, and a red brick residence which looked like a little chateau.\\nThanks for the good care taken, the manure heaps were as little offensive as such things can be; the watch-dogs lived in kennels, and countless poultry paraded through the tall grass.\\nEvery day, at noon, fifteen persons, masters, farmhands and the women folks, seated themselves around the long kitchen table where the soup was brought in steaming in a large, blue-flowered bowl.\\nThe beasts-horses, cows, pigs and sheep-were fat, well fed and clean. Maitre Lucas, a tall man who was getting stout, would go round three times a day, overseeing everything and thinking of everything.\\nA very old white horse, which the mistress wished to keep until its natural death, because she had brought it up and had always used it, and also because it recalled many happy memories, was housed, through sheer kindness of heart, at the end of the stable.\\nA young scamp about fifteen years old, Isidore Duval by name, and called, for convenience, Zidore, took care of this pensioner, gave him his measure of oats and fodder in winter, and in summer was supposed to change his pasturing place four times a day, so that he might have plenty of fresh grass.\\nThe animal, almost crippled, lifted with difficulty his legs, large at the knees and swollen above the hoofs. His coat, which was no longer curried, looked like white hair, and his long eyelashes gave to his eyes a sad expression.\\nWhen Zidore took the animal to pasture, he had to pull on the rope with all his might, because it walked so slowly; and the youth, bent over and out of breath, would swear at it, exasperated at having to care for this old nag.\\nThe farmhands, noticing the young rascal's anger against Coco, were amused and would continually talk of the horse to Zidore, in order to exasperate him. His comrades would make sport with him. In the village he was called Coco-Zidore.\\nThe boy would fume, feeling an unholy desire to revenge himself on the horse. He was a thin, long-legged, dirty child, with thick, coarse, bristly red hair. He seemed only half-witted, and stuttered as though ideas were unable to form in his thick, brute-like mind.\\nFor a long time he had been unable to understand why Coco should be kept, indignant at seeing things wasted on this useless beast. Since the horse could no longer work, it seemed to him unjust that he should be fed; he revolted at the idea of wasting oats, oats which were so expensive, on this paralyzed old plug. And often, in spite of the orders of Maitre Lucas, he would economize on the nag's food, only giving him half measure. Hatred grew in his confused, childlike mind, the hatred of a stingy, mean, fierce, brutal and cowardly peasant.\\nWhen summer came he had to move the animal about in the pasture. It was some distance away. The rascal, angrier every morning, would start, with his dragging step, across the wheat fields. The men working in the fields would shout to him, jokingly:\\n\\\"Hey, Zidore, remember me to Coco.\\\"\\nHe would not answer; but on the way he would break off a switch, and, as soon as he had moved the old horse, he would let it begin grazing; then, treacherously sneaking up behind it, he would slash its legs. The animal would try to escape, to kick, to get away from the blows, and run around in a circle about its rope, as though it had been inclosed in a circus ring. And the boy would slash away furiously, running along behind, his teeth clenched in anger.\\nThen he would go away slowly, without turning round, while the horse watched him disappear, his ribs sticking out, panting as a result of his unusual exertions. Not until the blue blouse of the young peasant was out of sight would he lower his thin white head to the grass.\\nAs the nights were now warm, Coco was allowed to sleep out of doors, in the field behind the little wood. Zidore alone went to see him. The boy threw stones at him to amuse himself. He would sit down on an embankment about ten feet away and would stay there about half an hour, from time to time throwing a sharp stone at the old horse, which remained standing tied before his enemy, watching him continually and not daring to eat before he was gone.\\nThis one thought persisted in the mind of the young scamp: \\\"Why feed this horse, which is no longer good for anything?\\\" It seemed to him that this old nag was stealing the food of the others, the goods of man and God, that he was even robbing him, Zidore, who was working.\\nThen, little by little, each day, the boy began to shorten the length of rope which allowed the horse to graze.\\nThe hungry animal was growing thinner, and starving. Too feeble to break his bonds, he would stretch his head out toward the tall, green, tempting grass, so near that he could smell, and yet so far that he could not touch it.\\nBut one morning Zidore had an idea: it was, not to move Coco any more. He was tired of walking so far for that old skeleton. He came, however, in order to enjoy his vengeance. The beast watched him anxiously. He did not beat him that day. He walked around him with his hands in his pockets. He even pretended to change his place, but he sank the stake in exactly the same hole, and went away overjoyed with his invention.\\nThe horse, seeing him leave, neighed to call him back; but the rascal began to run, leaving him alone, entirely alone in his field, well tied down and without a blade of grass within reach.\\nStarving, he tried to reach the grass which he could touch with the end of his nose. He got on his knees, stretching out his neck and his long, drooling lips. All in vain. The old animal spent the whole day in useless, terrible efforts. The sight of all that green food, which stretched out on all sides of him, served to increase the gnawing pangs of hunger.\\nThe scamp did not return that day. He wandered through the woods in search of nests.\\nThe next day he appeared upon the scene again. Coco, exhausted, had lain down. When he saw the boy, he got up, expecting at last to have his place changed.\\nBut the little peasant did not even touch the mallet, which was lying on the ground. He came nearer, looked at the animal, threw at his head a clump of earth which flattened out against the white hair, and he started off again, whistling.\\nThe horse remained standing as long as he could see him; then, knowing that his attempts to reach the near-by grass would be hopeless, he once more lay down on his side and closed his eyes.\\nThe following day Zidore did not come.\\nWhen he did come at last, he found Coco still stretched out; he saw that he was dead.\\nThen he remained standing, looking at him, pleased with what he had done, surprised that it should already be all over. He touched him with his foot, lifted one of his legs and then let it drop, sat on him and remained there, his eyes fixed on the grass, thinking of nothing. He returned to the farm, but did not mention the accident, because he wished to wander about at the hours when he used to change the horse's pasture. He went to see him the next day. At his approach some crows flew away. Countless flies were walking over the body and were buzzing around it. When he returned home, he announced the event. The animal was so old that nobody was surprised. The master said to two of the men:\\n\\\"Take your shovels and dig a hole right where he is.\\\"\\nThe men buried the horse at the place where he had died of hunger.

Henry\", \"story\": \"Every Saturday night the Clover Leaf Social Club gave a hop in the hall of the Give and Take Athletic Association on the East Side. In order to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the Give and Take--or, if you belong to the division that starts off with the right foot in waltzing, you must work in Rhinegold's paper-box factory. Still, any Clover Leaf was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance. But mostly each Give and Take brought the paper-box girl that he affected; and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops.\\nMaggie Toole, on account of her dull eyes, broad mouth and left- handed style of footwork in the twostep, went to the dances with Anna McCarty and her \\\"fellow.\\\" Anna and Maggie worked side by side in the factory, and were the greatest chums ever. So Anna always made Jimmy Burns take her by Maggie's house every Saturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them.\\nThe Give and Take Athletic Association lived up to its name. The hall of the association in Orchard street was fitted out with muscle-making inventions. With the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous combat. Between these more serious occupations the Saturday night hop with the paper-box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen. For sometimes the tip went 'round, and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter-weight affair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes.\\nOn Saturdays Rhinegold's paper-box factory closed at 3 P. M. On one such afternoon Anna and Maggie walked homeward together. At Maggie's door Anna said, as usual: \\\"Be ready at seven, sharp, Mag; and Jimmy and we'll come by for you.\\\"\\nBut what was this? Instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the non-escorted one there was to be perceived a high- poised head, a prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth, and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye.\\n\\\"Thanks, Anna,\\\" said Maggie; \\\"but you and Jimmy needn't bother to-night. I've a gentleman friend that's coming 'round to escort me to the hop.\\\"\\nThe comely Anna pounced upon her friend, shook her, chided and beseeched her. Maggie Toole catch a fellow! Plain, dear, loyal, unattractive Maggie, so sweet as a chum, so unsought for a two-step or a moonlit bench in the little park. How was it? When did it happen? Who was it?\\n\\\"You'll see to-night,\\\" said Maggie, flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had gathered in Cupid's vineyard. \\\"He's swell all right. He's two inches taller than Jimmy, and an up-to-date dresser. I'll introduce him, Anna, just as soon as we get to the hall.\\\"\\nAnna and Jimmy were among the first Clover Leafs to arrive that evening. Anna's eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friend's \\\"catch.\\\"\\nAt 8:30 Miss Toole swept into the hall with her escort. Quickly her triumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful Jimmy.\\n\\\"Oh, gee!\\\" cried Anna, \\\"Mag ain't made a hit--oh, no! Swell fellow? well, I guess! Style? Look at 'um.\\\"\\n\\\"Go as far as you like,\\\" said Jimmy, with sandpaper in his voice. \\\"Cop him out if you want him. These new guys always win out with the push. Don't mind me. He don't squeeze all the limes, I guess. Huh!\\\"\\n\\\"Shut up, Jimmy. You know what I mean. I'm glad for Mag. First fellow she ever had. Oh, here they come.\\\"\\nAcross the floor Maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser. And truly, her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum. He stood two inches taller than the average Give and Take athlete; his dark hair curled; his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles. The young men of the Clover Leaf Club pinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess, its achievements in hand-to-hand conflicts, and its preservation from the legal duress that constantly menaced it. The member of the association who would bind a paperbox maiden to his conquering chariot scorned to employ Beau Brummel airs. They were not considered honourable methods of warfare. The swelling biceps, the coat straining at its buttons over the chest, the air of conscious conviction of the supereminence of the male in the cosmogony of creation, even a calm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents in the gentle tourneys of Cupid--these were the approved arms and ammunition of the Clover Leaf gallants. They viewed, then, genuflexions and alluring poses of this visitor with their chins at a new angle.\\n\\\"A friend of mine, Mr. Terry O'Sullivan,\\\" was Maggie's formula of introduction. She led him around the room, presenting him to each new-arriving Clover Leaf. Almost was she pretty now, with the unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor and a kitten with its first mouse.\\n\\\"Maggie Toole's got a fellow at last,\\\" was the word that went round among the paper-box girls. \\\"Pipe Mag's floor-walker\\\"--thus the Give and Takes expressed their indifferent contempt.\\nUsually at the weekly hops Maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back. She felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a self- sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished. She had even grown used to noticing Anna joggle the reluctant Jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two-step.\\nBut to-night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six. Terry O'Sullivan was a victorious Prince Charming, and Maggie Toole winged her first butterfly flight. And though our tropes of fairyland be mixed with those of entomology they shall not spill one drop of ambrosia from the rose-crowned melody of Maggie's one perfect night.\\nThe girls besieged her for introductions to her \\\"fellow.\\\" The Clover Leaf young men, after two years of blindness, suddenly perceived charms in Miss Toole. They flexed their compelling muscles before her and bespoke her for the dance.\\nThus she scored; but to Terry O'Sullivan the honours of the evening fell thick and fast. He shook his curls; he smiled and went easily through the seven motions for acquiring grace in your own room before an open window ten minutes each day. He danced like a faun; he introduced manner and style and atmosphere; his words came trippingly upon his tongue, and--he waltzed twice in succession with the paper- box girl that Dempsey Donovan brought.\\nDempsey was the leader of the association. He wore a dress suit, and could chin the bar twice with one hand. He was one of \\\"Big Mike\\\" O'Sullivan's lieutenants, and was never troubled by trouble. No cop dared to arrest him. Whenever be broke a pushcart man's head or shot a member of the Heinrick B. Sweeney Outing and Literary Association in the kneecap, an officer would drop around and say:\\n\\\"The Cap'n 'd like to see ye a few minutes round to the office whin ye have time, Dempsey, me boy.\\\"\\nBut there would be sundry gentlemen there with large gold fob chains and black cigars; and somebody would tell a funny story, and then Dempsey would go back and work half an hour with the sixpound dumbbells. So, doing a tight-rope act on a wire stretched across Niagara was a safe terpsichorean performance compared with waltzing twice with Dempsey Donovan's paper-box girl. At 10 o'clock the jolly round face of \\\"Big Mike\\\" O'Sullivan shone at the door for five minutes upon the scene. He always looked in for five minutes, smiled at the girls and handed out real perfectos to the delighted boys.\\nDempsey Donovan was at his elbow instantly, talking rapidly. \\\"Big Mike\\\" looked carefully at the dancers, smiled, shook his head and departed.\\nThe music stopped. The dancers scattered to the chairs along the walls. Terry O'Sullivan, with his entrancing bow, relinquished a pretty girl in blue to her partner and started back to find Maggie. Dempsey intercepted him in the middle of the floor.\\nSome fine instinct that Rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly every one to turn and look at them--there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena. Two or three Give and Takes with tight coat sleeves drew nearer.\\n\\\"One moment, Mr. O'Sullivan,\\\" said Dempsey. \\\"I hope you're enjoying yourself. Where did you say you live?\\\"\\nThe two gladiators were well matched. Dempsey had, perhaps, ten pounds of weight to give away. The O'Sullivan had breadth with quickness. Dempsey had a glacial eye, a dominating slit of a mouth, an indestructible jaw, a complexion like a belle's and the coolness of a champion. The visitor showed more fire in his contempt and less control over his conspicuous sneer. They were enemies by the law written when the rocks were molten. They were each too splendid, too mighty, too incomparable to divide pre-eminence. One only must survive.\\n\\\"I live on Grand,\\\" said O'Sullivan, insolently; \\\"and no trouble to find me at home. Where do you live?\\\"\\nDempsey ignored the question.\\n\\\"You say your name's O'Sullivan,\\\" he went on. \\\"Well, 'Big Mike' says he never saw you before.\\\"\\n\\\"Lots of things he never saw,\\\" said the favourite of the hop.\\n\\\"As a rule,\\\" went on Dempsey, huskily sweet, \\\"O'Sullivans in this district know one another. You escorted one of our lady members here, and we want chance to make good. If you've got a family tree let's see a few historical O'Sullivan buds come out on it. Or do you want us to dig it out of you by the roots?\\\"\\n\\\"Suppose you mind your own business,\\\" suggested O'Sullivan, blandly.\\nDempsey's eye brightened. He held up an inspired forefinger as though a brilliant idea had struck him.\\n\\\"I've got it now,\\\" he said cordially. \\\"It was just a little mistake. You ain't no O'Sullivan. You are a ring-tailed monkey. Excuse us for not recognising you at first.\\\"\\nO'Sullivan's eye flashed. He made a quick movement, but Andy Geoghan was ready and caught his arm.\\nDempsey nodded at Andy and William McMahan, the secretary of the club, and walked rapidly toward a door at the rear of the hall. Two other members of the Give and Take Association swiftly joined the little group. Terry O'Sullivan was now in the hands of the Board of Rules and Social Referees. They spoke to him briefly and softly, and conducted him out through the same door at the rear.\\nThis movement on the part of the Clover Leaf members requires a word of elucidation. Back of the association hall was a smaller room rented by the club. In this room personal difficulties that arose on the ballroom floor were settled, man to man, with the weapons of nature, under the supervision of the board. No lady could say that she had witnessed a fight at a Clover Leaf hop in several years. Its gentlemen members guaranteed that.\\nSo easily and smoothly had Dempsey and the board done their preliminary work that many in the hall had not noticed the checking of the fascinating O'Sullivan's social triumph. Among these was Maggie. She looked about for her escort.\\n\\\"Smoke up!\\\" said Rose Cassidy. \\\"Wasn't you on? Demps Donovan picked a scrap with your Lizzie-boy, and they've waltzed out to the slaughter room with him. How's my hair look done up this way, Mag?\\\"\\nMaggie laid a hand on the bosom of her cheesecloth waist.\\n\\\"Gone to fight with Dempsey!\\\" she said, breathlessly. \\\"They've got to be stopped. Dempsey Donovan can't fight him. Why, he'll--he'll kill him!\\\"\\n\\\"Ah, what do you care?\\\" said Rosa. \\\"Don't some of 'em fight every hop?\\\"\\nBut Maggie was off, darting her zig-zag way through the maze of dancers. She burst through the rear door into the dark hall and then threw her solid shoulder against the door of the room of single combat. It gave way, and in the instant that she entered her eye caught the scene--the Board standing about with open watches; Dempsey Donovan in his shirt sleeves dancing, light-footed, with the wary grace of the modern pugilist, within easy reach of his adversary; Terry O'Sullivan standing with arms folded and a murderous look in his dark eyes. And without slacking the speed of her entrance she leaped forward with a scream--leaped in time to catch and hang upon the arm of O'Sullivan that was suddenly uplifted, and to whisk from it the long, bright stiletto that he had drawn from his bosom.\\nThe knife fell and rang upon the floor. Cold steel drawn in the rooms of the Give and Take Association! Such a thing had never happened before. Every one stood motionless for a minute. Andy Geoghan kicked the stiletto with the toe of his shoe curiously, like an antiquarian who has come upon some ancient weapon unknown to his learning.\\nAnd then O'Sullivan hissed something unintelligible between his teeth. Dempsey and the board exchanged looks. And then Dempsey looked at O'Sullivan without anger, as one looks at a stray dog, and nodded his head in the direction of the door.\\n\\\"The back stairs, Giuseppi,\\\" he said, briefly. \\\"Somebody'll pitch your hat down after you.\\\"\\nMaggie walked up to Dempsey Donovan. There was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks, down which slow tears were running. But she looked him bravely in the eye.\\n\\\"I knew it, Dempsey,\\\" she said, as her eyes grew dull even in their tears. \\\"I knew he was a Guinea. His name's Tony Spinelli. I hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin'. Them Guineas always carries knives. But you don't understand, Dempsey. I never had a fellow in my life. I got tired of comin' with Anna and Jimmy every night, so I fixed it with him to call himself O'Sullivan, and brought him along. I knew there'd be nothin' doin' for him if he came as a Dago. I guess I'll resign from the club now.\\\"\\nDempsey turned to Andy Geoghan.\\n\\\"Chuck that cheese slicer out of the window,\\\" he said, \\\"and tell 'em inside that Mr. O'Sullivan has had a telephone message to go down to Tammany Hall.\\\"\\nAnd then he turned back to Maggie.\\n\\\"Say, Mag,\\\" he said, \\\"I'll see you home. And how about next Saturday night? Will you come to the hop with me if I call around for you?\\\"\\nIt was remarkable how quickly Maggie's eyes could change from dull to a shining brown.\\n\\\"With you, Dempsey?\\\" she stammered. \\\"Say--will a duck swim?\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In this story, the Clover Leaf Social Club holds a dance every Saturday night.

Terry becomes the center of attention for the women in the paper-box factory, as well as the Clover Leaf men, due to his charming demeanor and good looks.\\n\\nAmidst the dance, 'Big Mike' O'Sullivan, associated with the Gain-and-Take Association, questions Terry's affiliation to the O'Sullivan family, which does not sit well with him. O'Sullivan challenges Terry, resulting in both men being taken to a back room in the hall for a fight supervised by the Board of Rules and Social Referees\\u2014a common occurrence at Clover Leaf hops. Recognizing the danger that Terry is in, Maggie intervenes just before the fight ensues, causing it to come to an abrupt halt. Terry is revealed to be a fraud and his real name is Tony Spinelli, a part of a dangerous Italian gang. Realizing her mistake, Maggie tearfully rescinds her newfound membership in the Clover Leaf Club. Dempsey Donovan, the leader of the club, defends Maggie and gently asks her to join him as his date for next week's dance rather than associating with bad company.\\n\\nThe story ends with a hopeful note as Maggie brightens up and happily agrees to go to the dance with Dempsey.\", \"story_token_count\": 3825, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 542, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 419}, {\"Title\": \"Confessing\", \"Author\": \"Guy de Maupassant\", \"story\": \"The noon sun poured fiercely down upon the fields. They stretched in undulating folds between the clumps of trees that marked each farmhouse; the different crops, ripe rye and yellowing wheat, pale-green oats, dark-green clover, spread a vast striped cloak, soft and rippling, over the naked body of the earth.\\nIn the distance, on the crest of a slope, was an endless line of cows, ranked like soldiers, some lying down, others standing, their large eyes blinking in the burning light, chewing the cud and grazing on a field of clover as broad as a lake.\\nTwo women, mother and daughter, were walking with a swinging step, one behind the other, towards this regiment of cattle. Each carried two zinc pails, slung outwards from the body on a hoop from a cask; at each step the metal sent out a dazzling white flash under the sun that struck full upon it.\\nThe women did not speak. They were on their way to milk the cows. When they arrive, they set down one of their pails and approach the first two cows, making them stand up with a kick in the ribs from wooden-shod feet. The beast rises slowly, first on its forelegs, then with more difficulty raises its large hind quarters, which seem to be weighted down by the enormous udder of livid pendulous flesh.\\nThe two Malivoires, mother and daughter, kneeling beneath the animal's belly, tug with a swift movement of their hands at the swollen teat, which at each squeeze sends a slender jet of milk into the pail. The yellowish froth mounts to the brim, and the women go from cow to cow until they reach the end of the long line.\\nAs soon as they finish milking a beast, they change its position, giving it a fresh patch of grass on which to graze.\\nThen they start on their way home, more slowly now, weighed down by the load of milk, the mother in front, the daughter behind.\\nAbruptly the latter halts, sets down her burden, Sits down, and begins to cry.\\nMadame Malivoire, missing the sound of steps behind her, turns round and is quite amazed.\\n\\\"What's the matter with you?\\\" she said.\\nHer daughter Celeste, a tall girl with flaming red hair and flaming cheeks, flecked with freckles as though sparks of fire had fallen upon her face one day as she worked in the sun, murmurs, moaning softly, like a beaten child:\\n\\\"I can't carry the milk any further.\\\"\\nHer mother looked at her suspiciously.\\n\\\"What's the matter with you?\\\" she repeated.\\n\\\"It drags too heavy, I can't,\\\" replied Celeste, who had collapsed and was lying on the ground between the two pails, hiding her eyes in her apron.\\n\\\"What's the matter with you, then?\\\" said her mother for the third time. The girl moaned:\\n\\\"I think there's a baby on the way.\\\" And she broke into sobs.\\nThe old woman now in her turn set down her load, so amazed that she could find nothing to say. At last she stammered:\\n\\\"You . . . you . . . you're going to have a baby, you clod! How can that be?\\\"\\nThe Malivoires were prosperous farmers, wealthy and of a certain position, widely respected, good business folk, of some importance in the district.\\n\\\"I think I am, all the same,\\\" faltered Celeste.\\nThe frightened mother looked at the weeping girl grovelling at her feet. After a few seconds she cried:\\n\\\"You're going to have a baby! A baby! Where did you get it, you slut?\\\"\\nCeleste, shaken with emotion, murmured:\\n\\\"I think it was in Polyte's coach.\\\"\\nThe old woman tried to understand, tried to imagine, to realise who could have brought this misfortune upon her daughter. If the lad was well off and of decent position, an arrangement might be come to. The damage could still be repaired. Celeste was not the first to be in the same way, but it was annoying all the same, seeing their position and the way people talked.\\n\\\"And who was it, you slut?\\\" she repeated.\\nCeleste, resolved to make a clean breast of it, stammered:\\n\\\"I think it was Polyte.\\\"\\nAt that Madame Malivoire, mad with rage, rushed upon her daughter and began to beat her with such fury that her hat fell off in the effort.\\nWith great blows of the fist she struck her on the head, on the back, all over her body; Celeste, prostrate between the two pails, which afforded her some slight protection, shielded just her face with her hands.\\nAll the cows, disturbed, had stopped grazing and turned round, staring with their great eyes. The last one mooed, stretching out its muzzle towards the women.\\nAfter beating her daughter till she was out of breath, Madame Malivoire stopped, exhausted; her spirits reviving a little, she tried to get a thorough understanding of the situation.\\n\\\"--- Polyte! Lord save us, it's not possible! How could you, with a carrier? You must have lost your wits. He must have played you a trick, the good-for-nothing!\\\"\\nCeleste, still prostrate, murmured in the dust:\\n\\\"I didn't pay my fare!\\\"\\nAnd the old Norman woman understood.\\nEvery week, on Wednesday and on Saturday, Celeste went to town with the farm produce, poultry, cream, and eggs.\\nShe started at seven with her two huge baskets on her arm, the dairy produce in one, the chickens in the other, and went to the main road to wait for the coach to Yvetot.\\nShe set down her wares and sat in the ditch, while the chickens with their short pointed beaks and the ducks with their broad flat bills thrust their heads between the wicker bars and looked about them with their round, stupid, surprised eyes.\\nSoon the bus, a sort of yellow box with a black leather cap on the top, came up, jerking and quivering with the trotting of the old white horse.\\nPolyte the coachman, a big, jolly fellow, stout though still young, and so burnt up by sun and wind, soaked by rain, and coloured with brandy that his face and neck were brick-red, cracked his whip and shouted from the distance:\\n\\\"Morning, Mam'selle Celeste. In good health, I hope?\\\"\\nShe gave him her baskets, one after the other, which he stowed in the boot; then she got in, lifting her leg high up to reach the step, and exposing a sturdy leg clad in a blue stocking.\\nEvery time Polyte repeated the same joke: \\\"Well, it's not got any thinner.\\\"\\nShe laughed, thinking this funny.\\nThen he uttered a \\\"Gee up, old girl!\\\" which started off the thin horse. Then Celeste, reaching for her purse in the depths of her pocket, slowly took out fivepence, threepence for herself and twopence for the baskets, and handed them to Polyte over his shoulder.\\nHe took them, saying:\\n\\\"Aren't we going to have our little bit of sport to-day?\\\"\\nAnd he laughed heartily, turning round towards her so as to stare at her at his ease.\\nShe found it a big expense, the half-franc for a journey of two miles. And when she had no coppers she felt it still more keenly; it was hard to make up her mind to part with a silver coin.\\nOne day, as she was paying, she asked:\\n\\\"From a good customer like me you oughtn't to take more than threepence.\\\"\\nHe burst out laughing.\\n\\\"Threepence, my beauty; why, you're worth more than that.\\\"\\nShe insisted on the point.\\n\\\"But you make a good two francs a month out of me.\\\"\\nHe whipped up his horse and exclaimed:\\n\\\"Look here, I'm an obliging fellow! We'll call it quits for a bit of sport.\\\"\\n\\\"What do you mean?\\\" she asked with an air of innocence.\\nHe was so amused that he laughed till he coughed.\\n\\\"A bit of sport is a bit of sport, damn it; a game for a lad and a lass, a dance for two without music.\\\"\\nShe understood, blushed, and declared:\\n\\\"I don't care for that sort of game, Monsieur Polyte.\\\"\\nBut he was in no way abashed, and repeated, with growing merriment:\\n\\\"You'll come to it some day, my beauty, a bit of sport for a lad and a lass!\\\"\\nAnd since that day he had taken to asking her, each time that she paid her fare:\\n\\\"Aren't we going to have our bit of sport to-day?\\\"\\nShe, too, joked about it by this time, and replied:\\n\\\"Not to-day, Monsieur Polyte, but Saturday, for certain!\\\"\\nAnd amid peals of laughter he answered:\\n\\\"Saturday, then, my beauty.\\\"\\nBut inwardly she calculated that, during the two years the affair had been going on, she had paid Polyte forty-eight whole francs, and in the country forty-eight francs is not a sum which can be picked up on the roadside; she also calculated that in two more years she would have paid nearly a hundred francs.\\nTo such purpose she meditated that, one spring day as they jogged on alone, when he made his customary inquiry: \\\"Aren't we going to have our bit of sport yet?\\\" She replied:\\n\\\"Yes, if you like, Monsieur Polyte.\\\"\\nHe was not at all surprised, and clambered over the back of his seat, murmuring with a complacent air:\\n\\\"Come along, then. I knew you'd come to it some day.\\\"\\nThe old white horse trotted so gently that she seemed to be dancing upon the same spot, deaf to the voice which cried at intervals, from the depths of the vehicle: \\\"Gee up, old girl! Gee up, then!\\\"\\nThree months later Celeste discovered that she was going to have a child.\\nAll this she had told her mother in a tearful voice. Pale with fury, the old woman asked:\\n\\\"Well, what did it cost?\\\"\\n\\\"Four months; that makes eight francs, doesn't it?\\\" replied Celeste.\\nAt that the peasant woman's fury was utterly unleashed, and, falling once more upon her daughter, she beat her a second time until she was out of breath. Then she rose and said:\\n\\\"Have you told him about the baby?\\\"\\n\\\"No, of course not.\\\"\\n\\\"Why haven't you told him?\\\"\\n\\\"Because very likely he'd have made me pay for all the free rides!\\\"\\nThe old woman pondered awhile, then picked up her milkpails.\\n\\\"Come on, get up, and try to walk home,\\\" she said, and, after a pause, continued:\\n\\\"And don't tell him as long as he doesn't notice anything, and we'll make six or eight months' fares out of him.\\\"\\nAnd Celeste, who had risen, still crying, dishevelled and swollen round the eyes, started off again with dragging steps, murmuring:\\n\\\"Of course I won't say.\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In this story, set in rural France, a mother and daughter are working on a farm, milking cows to collect milk.

On the sideboard behind her, two tall glasses, soda water, whiskey. Fresh ice cubes in the Thermos bucket.\\nMary Maloney was waiting for her husband to come home from work.\\nNow and again she would glance up at the clock, but without anxiety, merely to please herself with the thought that each minute gone by made it nearer the time when he would come. There was a slow smiling air about her, and about everything she did. The drop of a head as she bent over her sewing was curiously tranquil. Her skin--for this was her sixth month with child--had acquired a wonderful translucent quality, the mouth was soft, and the eyes, with their new placid look, seemed larger darker than before. When the clock said ten minutes to five, she began to listen, and a few moments later, punctually as always, she heard the tires on the gravel outside, and the car door slamming, the footsteps passing the window, the key turning in the lock. She laid aside her sewing, stood up, and went forward to kiss him as he came in.\\n\\\"Hullo darling,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"Hullo darling,\\\" he answered.\\nShe took his coat and hung it in the closet. Then she walked over and made the drinks, a strongish one for him, a weak one for herself; and soon she was back again in her chair with the sewing, and he in the other, opposite, holding the tall glass with both hands, rocking it so the ice cubes tinkled against the side.\\nFor her, this was always a blissful time of day. She knew he didn't want to speak much until the first drink was finished, and she, on her side, was content to sit quietly, enjoying his company after the long hours alone in the house. She loved to luxuriate in the presence of this man, and to feel-almost as a sunbather feels the sun-that warm male glow that came out of him to her when they were alone together. She loved him for the way he sat loosely in a chair, for the way he came in a door, or moved slowly across the room with long strides. She loved intent, far look in his eyes when they rested in her, the funny shape of the mouth, and especially the way he remained silent about his tiredness, sitting still with himself until the whiskey had taken some of it away.\\n\\\"Tired darling?\\\"\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm tired,\\\" And as he spoke, he did an unusual thing. He lifted his glass and drained it in one swallow although there was still half of it, at least half of it left.. She wasn't really watching him, but she knew what he had done because she heard the ice cubes falling back against the bottom of the empty glass when he lowered his arm. He paused a moment, leaning forward in the chair, then he got up and went slowly over to fetch himself another.\\n\\\"I'll get it!\\\" she cried, jumping up.\\n\\\"Sit down,\\\" he said.\\nWhen he came back, she noticed that the new drink was dark amber with the quantity of whiskey in it.\\n\\\"Darling, shall I get your slippers?\\\"\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\nShe watched him as he began to sip the dark yellow drink, and she could see little oily swirls in the liquid because it was so strong.\\n\\\"I think it's a shame,\\\" she said, \\\"that when a policeman gets to be as senior as you, they keep him walking about on his feet all day long.\\\"\\nHe didn't answer, so she bent her head again and went on with her sewing; but each time he lifted the drink to his lips, she heard the ice cubes clinking against the side of the glass.\\n\\\"Darling,\\\" she said. \\\"Would you like me to get you some cheese? I haven't made any supper because it's Thursday.\\\"\\n\\\"No,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"If you're too tired to eat out,\\\" she went on, \\\"it's still not too late. There's plenty of meat and stuff in the freezer, and you can have it right here and not even move out of the chair.\\\"\\nHer eyes waited on him for an answer, a smile, a little nod, but he made no sign.\\n\\\"Anyway,\\\" she went on, \\\"I'll get you some cheese and crackers first.\\\"\\n\\\"I don't want it,\\\" he said.\\nShe moved uneasily in her chair, the large eyes still watching his face. \\\"But you must eat! I'll fix it anyway, and then you can have it or not, as you like.\\\"\\nShe stood up and placed her sewing on the table by the lamp.\\n\\\"Sit down,\\\" he said. \\\"Just for a minute, sit down.\\\"\\nIt wasn't till then that she began to get frightened.\\n\\\"Go on,\\\" he said. \\\"Sit down.\\\"\\nShe lowered herself back slowly into the chair, watching him all the time with those large, bewildered eyes. He had finished the second drink and was staring down into the glass, frowning.\\n\\\"Listen,\\\" he said. \\\"I've got something to tell you.\\\"\\n\\\"What is it, darling? What's the matter?\\\"\\nHe had now become absolutely motionless, and he kept his head down so that the light from the lamp beside him fell across the upper part of his face, leaving the chin and mouth in shadow. She noticed there was a little muscle moving near the corner of his left eye.\\n\\\"This is going to be a bit of a shock to you, I'm afraid,\\\" he said. \\\"But I've thought about it a good deal and I've decided the only thing to do is tell you right away. I hope you won't blame me too much.\\\"\\nAnd he told her. It didn't take long, four or five minutes at most, and she say very still through it all, watching him with a kind of dazed horror as he went further and further away from her with each word.\\n\\\"So there it is,\\\" he added. \\\"And I know it's kind of a bad time to be telling you, bet there simply wasn't any other way. Of course I'll give you money and see you're looked after. But there needn't really be any fuss. I hope not anyway. It wouldn't be very good for my job.\\\"\\nHer first instinct was not to believe any of it, to reject it all. It occurred to her that perhaps he hadn't even spoken, that she herself had imagined the whole thing. Maybe, if she went about her business and acted as though she hadn't been listening, then later, when she sort of woke up again, she might find none of it had ever happened.\\n\\\"I'll get the supper,\\\" she managed to whisper, and this time he didn't stop her.\\nWhen she walked across the room she couldn't feel her feet touching the floor. She couldn't feel anything at all- except a slight nausea and a desire to vomit. Everything was automatic now-down the steps to the cellar, the light switch, the deep freeze, the hand inside the cabinet taking hold of the first object it met. She lifted it out, and looked at it. It was wrapped in paper, so she took off the paper and looked at it again.\\nA leg of lamb.\\nAll right then, they would have lamb for supper. She carried it upstairs, holding the thin bone-end of it with both her hands, and as she went through the living-room, she saw him standing over by the window with his back to her, and she stopped.\\n\\\"For God's sake,\\\" he said, hearing her, but not turning round. \\\"Don't make supper for me. I'm going out.\\\"\\nAt that point, Mary Maloney simply walked up behind him and without any pause she swung the big frozen leg of lamb high in the air and brought it down as hard as she could on the back of his head.\\nShe might just as well have hit him with a steel club.\\nShe stepped back a pace, waiting, and the funny thing was that he remained standing there for at least four or five seconds, gently swaying. Then he crashed to the carpet.\\nThe violence of the crash, the noise, the small table overturning, helped bring her out of he shock. She came out slowly, feeling cold and surprised, and she stood for a while blinking at the body, still holding the ridiculous piece of meat tight with both hands.\\nAll right, she told herself. So I've killed him.\\nIt was extraordinary, now, how clear her mind became all of a sudden. She began thinking very fast. As the wife of a detective, she knew quite well what the penalty would be. That was fine. It made no difference to her. In fact, it would be a relief. On the other hand, what about the child? What were the laws about murderers with unborn children? Did they kill then both-mother and child? Or did they wait until the tenth month? What did they do?\\nMary Maloney didn't know. And she certainly wasn't prepared to take a chance.\\nShe carried the meat into the kitchen, placed it in a pan, turned the oven on high, and shoved t inside. Then she washed her hands and ran upstairs to the bedroom. She sat down before the mirror, tidied her hair, touched up her lops and face. She tried a smile. It came out rather peculiar. She tried again.\\n\\\"Hullo Sam,\\\" she said brightly, aloud.\\nThe voice sounded peculiar too.\\n\\\"I want some potatoes please, Sam. Yes, and I think a can of peas.\\\"\\nThat was better. Both the smile and the voice were coming out better now. She rehearsed it several times more. Then she ran downstairs, took her coat, went out the back door, down the garden, into the street.\\nIt wasn't six o'clock yet and the lights were still on in the grocery shop.\\n\\\"Hullo Sam,\\\" she said brightly, smiling at the man behind the counter.\\n\\\"Why, good evening, Mrs. Maloney. How're you?\\\"\\n\\\"I want some potatoes please, Sam. Yes, and I think a can of peas.\\\"\\nThe man turned and reached up behind him on the shelf for the peas.\\n\\\"Patrick's decided he's tired and doesn't want to eat out tonight,\\\" she told him. \\\"We usually go out Thursdays, you know, and now he's caught me without any vegetables in the house.\\\"\\n\\\"Then how about meat, Mrs. Maloney?\\\"\\n\\\"No, I've got meat, thanks. I got a nice leg of lamb from the freezer.\\\"\\n\\\"Oh.\\\"\\n\\\"I don't know much like cooking it frozen, Sam, but I'm taking a chance on it this time. You think it'll be all right?\\\"\\n\\\"Personally,\\\" the grocer said, \\\"I don't believe it makes any difference. You want these Idaho potatoes?\\\"\\n\\\"Oh yes, that'll be fine. Two of those.\\\"\\n\\\"Anything else?\\\" The grocer cocked his head on one side, looking at her pleasantly. \\\"How about afterwards? What you going to give him for afterwards?\\\"\\n\\\"Well-what would you suggest, Sam?\\\"\\nThe man glanced around his shop. \\\"How about a nice big slice of cheesecake? I know he likes that.\\\"\\n\\\"Perfect,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves it.\\\"\\nAnd when it was all wrapped and she had paid, she put on her brightest smile and said, \\\"Thank you, Sam. Goodnight.\\\"\\n\\\"Goodnight, Mrs. Maloney. And thank you.\\\"\\nAnd now, she told herself as she hurried back, all she was doing now, she was returning home to her husband and he was waiting for his supper; and she must cook it good, and make it as tasty as possible because the poor man was tired; and if, when she entered the house, she happened to find anything unusual, or tragic, or terrible, then naturally it would be a shock and she'd become frantic with grief and horror. Mind you, she wasn't expecting to find anything. She was just going home with the vegetables. Mrs. Patrick Maloney going home with the vegetables on Thursday evening to cook supper for her husband.\\nThat's the way, she told herself. Do everything right and natural. Keep things absolutely natural and there'll be no need for any acting at all.\\nTherefore, when she entered the kitchen by the back door, she was humming a little tune to herself and smiling.\\n\\\"Patrick!\\\" she called. \\\"How are you, darling?\\\"\\nShe put the parcel down on the table and went through into the living room; and when she saw him lying there on the floor with his legs doubled up and one arm twisted back underneath his body, it really was rather a shock. All the old love and longing for him welled up inside her, and she ran over to him, knelt down beside him, and began to cry her heart out. It was easy. No acting was necessary.\\nA few minutes later she got up and went to the phone. She know the number of the police station, and when the man at the other end answered, she cried to him, \\\"Quick! Come quick! Patrick's dead!\\\"\\n\\\"Who's speaking?\\\"\\n\\\"Mrs. Maloney. Mrs. Patrick Maloney.\\\"\\n\\\"You mean Patrick Maloney's dead?\\\"\\n\\\"I think so,\\\" she sobbed. \\\"He's lying on the floor and I think he's dead.\\\"\\n\\\"Be right over,\\\" the man said.\\nThe car came very quickly, and when she opened the front door, two policeman walked in. She know them both-she know nearly all the man at that precinct-and she fell right into a chair, then went over to join the other one, who was called O'Malley, kneeling by the body.\\n\\\"Is he dead?\\\" she cried.\\n\\\"I'm afraid he is. What happened?\\\"\\nBriefly, she told her story about going out to the grocer and coming back to find him on the floor. While she was talking, crying and talking, Noonan discovered a small patch of congealed blood on the dead man's head. He showed it to O'Malley who got up at once and hurried to the phone.\\nSoon, other men began to come into the house. First a doctor, then two detectives, one of whom she know by name. Later, a police photographer arrived and took pictures, and a man who know about fingerprints. There was a great deal of whispering and muttering beside the corpse, and the detectives kept asking her a lot of questions. But they always treated her kindly. She told her story again, this time right from the beginning, when Patrick had come in, and she was sewing, and he was tired, so tired he hadn't wanted to go out for supper. She told how she'd put the meat in the oven-\\\"it's there now, cooking\\\"- and how she'd slopped out to the grocer for vegetables, and come back to find him lying on the floor.\\nWhich grocer?\\\" one of the detectives asked.\\nShe told him, and he turned and whispered something to the other detective who immediately went outside into the street.\\nIn fifteen minutes he was back with a page of notes, and there was more whispering, and through her sobbing she heard a few of the whispered phrases-\\\"...acted quite normal...very cheerful...wanted to give him a good supper...peas...cheesecake...impossible that she...\\\"\\nAfter a while, the photographer and the doctor departed and two other men came in and took the corpse away on a stretcher. Then the fingerprint man went away. The two detectives remained, and so did the two policeman. They were exceptionally nice to her, and Jack Noonan asked if she wouldn't rather go somewhere else, to her sister's house perhaps, or to his own wife who would take care of her and put her up for the night.\\nNo, she said. She didn't feel she could move even a yard at the moment. Would they mind awfully of she stayed just where she was until she felt better. She didn't feel too good at the moment, she really didn't.\\nThen hadn't she better lie down on the bed? Jack Noonan asked.\\nNo, she said. She'd like to stay right where she was, in this chair. A little later, perhaps, when she felt better, she would move.\\nSo they left her there while they went about their business, searching the house. Occasionally on of the detectives asked her another question. Sometimes Jack Noonan spoke at her gently as he passed by. Her husband, he told her, had been killed by a blow on the back of the head administered with a heavy blunt instrument, almost certainly a large piece of metal. They were looking for the weapon. The murderer may have taken it with him, but on the other hand he may have thrown it away or hidden it somewhere on the premises.\\n\\\"It's the old story,\\\" he said. \\\"Get the weapon, and you've got the man.\\\"\\nLater, one of the detectives came up and sat beside her. Did she know, he asked, of anything in the house that could've been used as the weapon? Would she mind having a look around to see if anything was missing-a very big spanner, for example, or a heavy metal vase.\\nThey didn't have any heavy metal vases, she said.\\n\\\"Or a big spanner?\\\"\\nShe didn't think they had a big spanner. But there might be some things like that in the garage.\\nThe search went on. She knew that there were other policemen in the garden all around the house. She could hear their footsteps on the gravel outside, and sometimes she saw a flash of a torch through a chink in the curtains. It began to get late, nearly nine she noticed by the clock on the mantle. The four men searching the rooms seemed to be growing weary, a trifle exasperated.\\n\\\"Jack,\\\" she said, the next tome Sergeant Noonan went by. \\\"Would you mind giving me a drink?\\\"\\n\\\"Sure I'll give you a drink. You mean this whiskey?\\\"\\n\\\"Yes please. But just a small one. It might make me feel better.\\\"\\nHe handed her the glass.\\n\\\"Why don't you have one yourself,\\\" she said. \\\"You must be awfully tired. Please do. You've been very good to me.\\\"\\n\\\"Well,\\\" he answered. \\\"It's not strictly allowed, but I might take just a drop to keep me going.\\\"\\nOne by one the others came in and were persuaded to take a little nip of whiskey. They stood around rather awkwardly with the drinks in their hands, uncomfortable in her presence, trying to say consoling things to her. Sergeant Noonan wandered into the kitchen, come out quickly and said, \\\"Look, Mrs. Maloney. You know that oven of yours is still on, and the meat still inside.\\\"\\n\\\"Oh dear me!\\\" she cried. \\\"So it is!\\\"\\n\\\"I better turn it off for you, hadn't I?\\\"\\n\\\"Will you do that, Jack.

Now she was resting in her bed, lying on her back, her eyes closed, her features calm, her long white hair carefully arranged as though she had done it up ten minutes before dying. The whole pale countenance of the dead woman was so collected, so calm, so resigned that one could feel what a sweet soul had lived in that body, what a quiet existence this old soul had led, how easy and pure the death of this parent had been.\\nKneeling beside the bed, her son, a magistrate with inflexible principles, and her daughter, Marguerite, known as Sister Eulalie, were weeping as though their hearts would break. She had, from childhood up, armed them with a strict moral code, teaching them religion, without weakness, and duty, without compromise. He, the man, had become a judge and handled the law as a weapon with which he smote the weak ones without pity. She, the girl, influenced by the virtue which had bathed her in this austere family, had become the bride of the Church through her loathing for man.\\nThey had hardly known their father, knowing only that he had made their mother most unhappy, without being told any other details.\\nThe nun was wildly-kissing the dead woman's hand, an ivory hand as white as the large crucifix lying across the bed. On the other side of the long body the other hand seemed still to be holding the sheet in the death grasp; and the sheet had preserved the little creases as a memory of those last movements which precede eternal immobility.\\nA few light taps on the door caused the two sobbing heads to look up, and the priest, who had just come from dinner, returned. He was red and out of breath from his interrupted digestion, for he had made himself a strong mixture of coffee and brandy in order to combat the fatigue of the last few nights and of the wake which was beginning.\\nHe looked sad, with that assumed sadness of the priest for whom death is a bread winner. He crossed himself and approaching with his professional gesture: \\\"Well, my poor children! I have come to help you pass these last sad hours.\\\" But Sister Eulalie suddenly arose. \\\"Thank you, \\\"father, but my brother and I prefer to remain alone with her. This is our last chance to see her, and we wish to be together, all three of us, as we--we--used to be when we were small and our poor mo--mother----\\\"\\nGrief and tears stopped her; she could not continue.\\nOnce more serene, the priest bowed, thinking of his bed. \\\"As you wish, my children.\\\" He kneeled, crossed himself, prayed, arose and went out quietly, murmuring: \\\"She was a saint!\\\"\\nThey remained alone, the dead woman and her children. The ticking of the clock, hidden in the shadow, could be heard distinctly, and through the open window drifted in the sweet smell of hay and of woods, together with the soft moonlight. No other noise could be heard over the land except the occasional croaking of the frog or the chirping of some belated insect. An infinite peace, a divine melancholy, a silent serenity surrounded this dead woman, seemed to be breathed out from her and to appease nature itself.\\nThen the judge, still kneeling, his head buried in the bed clothes, cried in a voice altered by grief and deadened by the sheets and blankets: \\\"Mamma, mamma, mamma!\\\" And his sister, frantically striking her forehead against the woodwork, convulsed, twitching and trembling as in an epileptic fit, moaned: \\\"Jesus, Jesus, mamma, Jesus!\\\" And both of them, shaken by a storm of grief, gasped and choked.\\nThe crisis slowly calmed down and they began to weep quietly, just as on the sea when a calm follows a squall.\\nA rather long time passed and they arose and looked at their dead. And the memories, those distant memories, yesterday so dear, to-day so torturing, came to their minds with all the little forgotten details, those little intimate familiar details which bring back to life the one who has left. They recalled to each other circumstances, words, smiles, intonations of the mother who was no longer to speak to them. They saw her again happy and calm. They remembered things which she had said, and a little motion of the hand, like beating time, which she often used when emphasizing something important.\\nAnd they loved her as they never had loved her before. They measured the depth of their grief, and thus they discovered how lonely they would find themselves.\\nIt was their prop, their guide, their whole youth, all the best part of their lives which was disappearing. It was their bond with life, their mother, their mamma, the connecting link with their forefathers which they would thenceforth miss. They now became solitary, lonely beings; they could no longer look back.\\nThe nun said to her brother: \\\"You remember how mamma used always to read her old letters; they are all there in that drawer. Let us, in turn, read them; let us live her whole life through tonight beside her! It would be like a road to the cross, like making the acquaintance of her mother, of our grandparents, whom we never knew, but whose letters are there and of whom she so often spoke, do you remember?\\\"\\nOut of the drawer they took about ten little packages of yellow paper, tied with care and arranged one beside the other. They threw these relics on the bed and chose one of them on which the word \\\"Father\\\" was written. They opened and read it.\\nIt was one of those old-fashioned letters which one finds in old family desk drawers, those epistles which smell of another century. The first one started: \\\"My dear,\\\" another one: \\\"My beautiful little girl,\\\" others: \\\"My dear child,\\\" or: \\\"My dear daughter.\\\" And suddenly the nun began to read aloud, to read over to the dead woman her whole history, all her tender memories. The judge, resting his elbow on the bed, was listening with his eyes fastened on his mother. The motionless body seemed happy.\\nSister Eulalie, interrupting herself, said suddenly:\\n\\\"These ought to be put in the grave with her; they ought to be used as a shroud and she ought to be buried in it.\\\" She took another package, on which no name was written. She began to read in a firm voice: \\\"My adored one, I love you wildly. Since yesterday I have been suffering the tortures of the damned, haunted by our memory. I feel your lips against mine, your eyes in mine, your breast against mine. I love you, I love you! You have driven me mad. My arms open, I gasp, moved by a wild desire to hold you again. My whole soul and body cries out for you, wants you. I have kept in my mouth the taste of your kisses--\\\"\\nThe judge had straightened himself up. The nun stopped reading. He snatched the letter from her and looked for the signature. There was none, but only under the words, \\\"The man who adores you,\\\" the name \\\"Henry.\\\" Their father's name was Rene. Therefore this was not from him. The son then quickly rummaged through the package of letters, took one out and read: \\\"I can no longer live without your caresses.\\\" Standing erect, severe as when sitting on the bench, he looked unmoved at the dead woman. The nun, straight as a statue, tears trembling in the corners of her eyes, was watching her brother, waiting. Then he crossed the room slowly, went to the window and stood there, gazing out into the dark night.\\nWhen he turned around again Sister Eulalie, her eyes dry now, was still standing near the bed, her head bent down.\\nHe stepped forward, quickly picked up the letters and threw them pell-mell back into the drawer. Then he closed the curtains of the bed.\\nWhen daylight made the candles on the table turn pale the son slowly left his armchair, and without looking again at the mother upon whom he had passed sentence, severing the tie that united her to son and daughter, he said slowly: \\\"Let us now retire, sister.\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story centers around the death of an elderly woman, who is described as having led a blameless and peaceful life.

B. white\", \"story\": \"Everything he kept saying is something it isn't. And everybody is always somewhere else. Maybe it was the city, being in the city, that made him feel how queer everything was and that it was something else. Maybe he kept thinking it was the names of the things. The names were tex and frequently koid. Or they were flex and oid or they were duroid sand or flexsan duro, but everything was glass but not quite glass and the thing that you touched the surface, washable, crease-resistant was rubber, only it wasn't quite rubber and you didn't quite touch it but almost. The wall, which was glass but turned out on being approached not to be a wall, it was something else, it was an opening or doorway--and the doorway through which he saw himself approaching turned out to be something else, it was a wall. And what he had eaten not having agreed with him.\\nHe was in a washable house, but he wasn't sure. Now about those rats, he kept saying to himself. He meant the rats that the Professor had driven crazy by forcing them to deal with problems which were beyond the scope of rats, the insoluble problems. He meant the rats that had been trained to jump at the square card with the circle in the middle, and the card because it was something it wasn't would give way and let the rat into a place where the food was, but then one day it would be a trick played on the rat, and the card would be changed, and the rat would jump but the card wouldn't give way, and it was an impossible situation for a rat and the rat would go insane and into its eyes would come the unspeakably bright imploring look of the frustrated, and after the convulsions were over and the frantic racing around, then the passive stage would set in and the willingness to let anything be done to it, even if it was something else.\\nHe didn't know which door or wall or opening in the house to jump at, to get through, because one was an opening that wasn't a door it was a void, or kid and the other was a wall that wasn't an opening, it was a sanitary cupboard of the same color. He caught a glimpse of his eyes staring into his eyes, in the and in them was the expression he had seen in the picture of the rats--weary after convulsions and the frantic racing around, when they were willing and did not mind having anything done to them. More and more he kept saying I am confronted by a problem which is incapable of solution for this time even if he chose the right door, there would be no food behind it and that is what madness is, and things seeming different from what they are. He heard, in the house where he was, in the city to which he had gone as toward a door which might, or might not, give way, a noise--not a loud noise but more of a low prefabricated humming. It came from a place in the base of the wall or stat where the flue carrying the filterable air was, and not far from the Minipiano, which was made of the same material nailbrushes are made of, and which was under the stairs. \\\"This, too, has been tested,\\\" she said, pointing, but not at it, \\\"and found viable.\\\" It wasn't a loud noise, he kept thinking, sorry that he had seen his eyes, even though it was through his own eyes that he had seen them.\\nFirst will come the convulsions he said, then the exhaustion, then the willingness to let anything be done. \\\"And you better believe it will be.\\\"\\nAll his life he had been confronted by situations which were incapable of being solved, and there was a deliberateness behind all this, behind this changing of the card or door, because they would always wait until you had learned to jump at the certain card or door--the one with the circle--and then they would change it on you. There have been so many doors changed on me, he said, in the last twenty years, but it is now becoming clear that it is an impossible situation, and the question is whether to jump again, even though they ruffle you in the rump with a blast of air--to make you jump. He wished he wasn't standing by the Minipiano. First they would teach you the prayers and the Psalms, and that would be the right doorthe one with the circle and the long sweet words with the holy sound, and that would be the one to jump at to get where the food was. Then one day you jumped and it didn't give way, so that all you got was the bump on the nose, and the first bewilderment, the first young bewilderment.\\nI don't know whether to tell her about the door they substituted or not, he said, the one with the equation on it and the picture of the amoeba reproducing itself by division. Or the one with the photostatic copy of the check for thirty-two dollars and fifty cents. But the jumping was so long ago, although the bump is . . . how those old wounds hurt! Being crazy this way wouldn't be so bad if only, if only. If only when you put your foot forward to take a step, the ground wouldn't come up to meet your foot the way it does. And the same way in the street only I may never get back to the street unless I jump at the right door, the curb coming up to meet your foot, anticipating ever so delicately the weight of the body, which is somewhere else. \\\"We could take your name,\\\" she said, \\\"and send it to you.\\\" And it wouldn't be so bad if only you could read a sentence all the way through without jumping your eye to something else on the same page; and then he kept thinking there was that man out in Jersey, the one who started to chop his trees down, one by one, the man who began talking about how he would take his house to pieces, brick by brick, because he faced a problem incapable of solution, probably, so he began to hack at the trees in the yard, began to pluck with trembling fingers at the bricks in the house. Even if a house is not washable, it is worth taking down. It is not till later that the exhaustion sets in.\\nBut it is inevitable that they will keep changing the doors on you, he said, because that is what they are for; and the thing is to get used to it and not let it unsettle the mind. But that would mean not jumping, and you can't. Nobody can not jump. There will be no not-jumping. Among rats, perhaps, but among people never. Everybody has to keep jumping at a door the one with the circle on it because that is the way everybody is, especially some people. You wouldn't want me, standing here, to tell you, would you, about my friend the poet deceased who said, \\\"My heart has followed all my days something I cannot name\\\"? It had the circle on it. And like many poets, although few so beloved, he is gone. It killed him, the jumping. First, of course, there were the preliminary bouts, the convulsions, and the calm and the willingness.\\nI remember the door with the picture of the girl on it only it was spring, her arms outstretched in loveliness, her dress it was the one with the circle on it uncaught, beginning the slow, clear, blinding cascade-and I guess we would all like to try that door again, for it seemed like the way and for a while it was the way, the door would open and you would go through winged and exalted like any rat and the food would be there, the way the Professor had it arranged, everything O.K., and you had chosen the right door for the world was young. The time they changed that door on me, my nose bled for a hundred hours--how do you like that, Madam? Or would you prefer to show me further through this so strange house, or you could take my name and send it to me, for although my heart has followed all my days something I cannot name, I am tired of the jumping and I do not know which way to go, Madam, and I am not even sure that I am not tired beyond the endurance of man rat, if you will and have taken leave of sanity. What are you following these days, old friend, after your recovery from the last bump? What is the name, or is it something you cannot name? The rats have a name for it by this time, perhaps, but I don't know what they call it. I call it and it comes in sheets, something like insulating board, unattainable and ugli-proof.\\nAnd there was the man out in Jersey, because I keep thinking about his terrible necessity and the passion and trouble he had gone to all those years in the indescribable abundance of a householder's detail, building the estate and the planting of the trees and in spring the lawn-dressing and in fall the bulbs for the spring burgeoning, and the watering of the grass on the long light evenings in summer and the gravel for the driveway all had to be thought out, planned and the decorative borders, probably, the perennials and the bug spray, and the building of the house from plans of the architect, first the sills, then the studs, then the full corn in the ear, the floors laid on the floor timbers, smoothed, and then the carpets upon the smooth floors and the curtains and the rods therefor. And then, almost without warning, he would be jumping at the same old door and it wouldn't give: they had changed it on him, making life no longer supportable under the elms in the elm shade, under the maples in the maple shade.\\n\\\"Here you have the maximum of openness in a small room.\\\"\\nIt was impossible to say maybe it was the city what made him feel the way he did, and I am not the only one either, he kept thinking--ask any doctor if I am. The doctors, they know how many there are, they even know where the trouble is only they don't like to tell you about the prefrontal lobe because that means making a hole in your skull and removing the work of centuries. It took so long coming, this lobe, so many, many years. Is it something you read in the paper, perhaps? And now, the strain being so great, the door having been changed by the Professor once too often . . . but it only means a whiff of ether, a few deft strokes, and the higher animal becomes a little easier in his mind and more like the lower one. From now on, you see, that's the way it will be, the ones with the small prefrontal lobes will win because the other ones are hurt too much by this incessant bumping. They can stand just so much, em, Doctor? And what is that, pray, that you have in your hand? Still, you never can tell, em, Madam?\\nHe crossed carefully the room, the thick carpet under him softly, and went toward the door carefully, which was glass and he could see himself in it, and which, at his approach, opened to allow him to pass through; and beyond he half expected to find one of the old doors that he had known, perhaps the one with the circle, the one with the girl her arms outstretched in loveliness and beauty before him. But he saw instead a moving stairway, and descended in light he kept thinking to the street below and to the other people.

You would deprive yourself of nothing.\\\"\\n\\\"That's so,\\\" she said, a little embarrassed.\\nA big omnibus was passing by, drawn by three big horses, which were trotting along. Lebrument called out:\\n\\\"Conductor! Conductor!\\\"\\nThe heavy carriage stopped. And the young lawyer, pushing his wife, said to her quickly:\\n\\\"Go inside; I'm going up on top, so that I may smoke at least one cigarette before lunch.\\\"\\nShe had no time to answer. The conductor, who had seized her by the arm to help her up the step, pushed her inside, and she fell into a seat, bewildered, looking through the back window at the feet of her husband as he climbed up to the top of the vehicle.\\nAnd she sat there motionless, between a fat man who smelled of cheap tobacco and an old woman who smelled of garlic.\\nAll the other passengers were lined up in silence--a grocer's boy, a young girl, a soldier, a gentleman with gold-rimmed spectacles and a big silk hat, two ladies with a self-satisfied and crabbed look, which seemed to say: \\\"We are riding in this thing, but we don't have to,\\\" two sisters of charity and an undertaker. They looked like a collection of caricatures.\\nThe jolting of the wagon made them wag their heads and the shaking of the wheels seemed to stupefy them--they all looked as though they were asleep.\\nThe young woman remained motionless.\\n\\\"Why didn't he come inside with me?\\\" she was saying to herself. An unaccountable sadness seemed to be hanging over her. He really need not have acted so.\\nThe sisters motioned to the conductor to stop, and they got off one after the other, leaving in their wake the pungent smell of camphor. The bus started tip and soon stopped again. And in got a cook, red-faced and out of breath. She sat down and placed her basket of provisions on her knees. A strong odor of dish-water filled the vehicle.\\n\\\"It's further than I imagined,\\\" thought Jeanne.\\nThe undertaker went out, and was replaced by a coachman who seemed to bring the atmosphere of the stable with him. The young girl had as a successor a messenger, the odor of whose feet showed that he was continually walking.\\nThe lawyer's wife began to feel ill at ease, nauseated, ready to cry without knowing why.\\nOther persons left and others entered. The stage went on through interminable streets, stopping at stations and starting again.\\n\\\"How far it is!\\\" thought Jeanne. \\\"I hope he hasn't gone to sleep! He has been so tired the last few days.\\\"\\nLittle by little all the passengers left. She was left alone, all alone. The conductor cried:\\n\\\"Vaugirard!\\\"\\nSeeing that she did not move, he repeated:\\n\\\"Vaugirard!\\\"\\nShe looked at him, understanding that he was speaking to her, as there was no one else there. For the third time the man said:\\n\\\"Vaugirard!\\\"\\nThen she asked:\\n\\\"Where are we?\\\"\\nHe answered gruffly:\\n\\\"We're at Vaugirard, of course! I have been yelling it for the last half hour!\\\"\\n\\\"Is it far from the Boulevard?\\\" she said.\\n\\\"Which boulevard?\\\"\\n\\\"The Boulevard des Italiens.\\\"\\n\\\"We passed that a long time ago!\\\"\\n\\\"Would you mind telling my husband?\\\"\\n\\\"Your husband! Where is he?\\\"\\n\\\"On the top of the bus.\\\"\\n\\\"On the top! There hasn't been anybody there for a long time.\\\"\\nShe started, terrified.\\n\\\"What? That's impossible! He got on with me. Look well! He must be there.\\\"\\nThe conductor was becoming uncivil:\\n\\\"Come on, little one, you've talked enough! You can find ten men for every one that you lose. Now run along. You'll find another one somewhere.\\\"\\nTears were coming to her eyes. She insisted:\\n\\\"But, monsieur, you are mistaken; I assure you that you must be mistaken. He had a big portfolio under his arm.\\\"\\nThe man began to laugh:\\n\\\"A big portfolio! Oh, yes! He got off at the Madeleine. He got rid of you, all right! Ha! ha! ha!\\\"\\nThe stage had stopped. She got out and, in spite of herself, she looked up instinctively to the roof of the bus. It was absolutely deserted.\\nThen she began to cry, and, without thinking that anybody was listening or watching her, she said out loud:\\n\\\"What is going to become of me?\\\"\\nAn inspector approached:\\n\\\"What's the matter?\\\"\\nThe conductor answered, in a bantering tone of voice:\\n\\\"It's a lady who got left by her husband during the trip.\\\"\\nThe other continued:\\n\\\"Oh! that's nothing. You go about your business.\\\"\\nThen he turned on his heels and walked away.\\nShe began to walk straight ahead, too bewildered, too crazed even to understand what had happened to her. Where was she to go? What could she do? What could have happened to him? How could he have made such a mistake? How could he have been so forgetful?\\nShe had two francs in her pocket. To whom could she go? Suddenly she remembered her cousin Barral, one of the assistants in the offices of the Ministry of the Navy.\\nShe had just enough to pay for a cab. She drove to his house. He met her just as he was leaving for his office. He was carrying a large portfolio under his arm, just like Lebrument.\\nShe jumped out of the carriage.\\n\\\"Henry!\\\" she cried.\\nHe stopped, astonished:\\n\\\"Jeanne! Here--all alone! What are you doing? Where have you come from?\\\"\\nHer eyes full of tears, she stammered:\\n\\\"My husband has just got lost!\\\"\\n\\\"Lost! Where?\\\"\\n\\\"On an omnibus.\\\"\\n\\\"On an omnibus?\\\"\\nWeeping, she told him her whole adventure.\\nHe listened, thought, and then asked:\\n\\\"Was his mind clear this morning?\\\"\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\\"Good. Did he have much money with him?\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, he was carrying my dowry.\\\"\\n\\\"Your dowry! The whole of it?\\\"\\n\\\"The whole of it--in order to pay for the practice which he bought.\\\"\\n\\\"Well, my dear cousin, by this time your husband must be well on his way to Belgium.\\\"\\nShe could not understand. She kept repeating:\\n\\\"My husband--you say--\\\"\\n\\\"I say that he has disappeared with your--your capital--that's all!\\\"\\nShe stood there, a prey to conflicting emotions, sobbing.\\n\\\"Then he is--he is--he is a villain!\\\"\\nAnd, faint from excitement, she leaned her head on her cousin's shoulder and wept.\\nAs people were stopping to look at them, he pushed her gently into the vestibule of his house, and, supporting her with his arm around her waist, he led her up the stairs, and as his astonished servant opened the door, he ordered:\\n\\\"Sophie, run to the restaurant and get a luncheon for two.

The waves followed each other close, rolling in as high as mountains, scattering the foam as they broke.\\nThe storm engulfed itself in the little valley of Yport, whistling and moaning, tearing the shingles from the roofs, smashing the shutters, knocking down the chimneys, rushing through the narrow streets in such gusts that one could walk only by holding on to the walls, and children would have been lifted up like leaves and carried over the houses into the fields.\\nThe fishing smacks had been hauled high up on land, because at high tide the sea would sweep the beach. Several sailors, sheltered behind the curved bottoms of their boats, were watching this battle of the sky and the sea.\\nThen, one by one, they went away, for night was falling on the storm, wrapping in shadows the raging ocean and all the battling elements.\\nJust two men remained, their hands plunged deep into their pockets, bending their backs beneath the squall, their woolen caps pulled down over their ears; two big Normandy fishermen, bearded, their skin tanned through exposure, with the piercing black eyes of the sailor who looks over the horizon like a bird of prey.\\nOne of them was saying:\\n\\\"Come on, Jeremie, let's go play dominoes. It's my treat.\\\"\\nThe other hesitated a while, tempted on one hand by the game and the thought of brandy, knowing well that, if he went to Paumelle's, he would return home drunk; held back, on the other hand, by the idea of his wife remaining alone in the house.\\nHe asked:\\n\\\"Any one might think that you had made a bet to get me drunk every night. Say, what good is it doing you, since it's always you that's treating?\\\"\\nNevertheless he was smiling at the idea of all this brandy drunk at the expense of another. He was smiling the contented smirk of an avaricious Norman.\\nMathurin, his friend, kept pulling him by the sleeve.\\n\\\"Come on, Jeremie. This isn't the kind of a night to go home without anything to warm you up. What are you afraid of? Isn't your wife going to warm your bed for you?\\\"\\nJeremie answered:\\n\\\"The other night I couldn't find the door--I had to be fished out of the ditch in front of the house!\\\"\\nHe was still laughing at this drunkard's recollection, and he was unconsciously going toward Paumelle's Caf\\u00e9, where a light was shining in the window; he was going, pulled by Mathurin and pushed by the wind, unable to resist these combined forces.\\nThe low room was full of sailors, smoke and noise. All these men, clad in woolens, their elbows on the tables, were shouting to make themselves heard. The more people came in, the more one had to shout in order to overcome the noise of voices and the rattling of dominoes on the marble tables.\\nJeremie and Mathurin sat down in a corner and began a game, and the glasses were emptied in rapid succession into their thirsty throats.\\nThen they played more games and drank more glasses. Mathurin kept pouring and winking to the saloon keeper, a big, red-faced man, who chuckled as though at the thought of some fine joke; and Jeremie kept absorbing alcohol and wagging his head, giving vent to a roar of laughter and looking at his comrade with a stupid and contented expression.\\nAll the customers were going away. Every time that one of them would open the door to leave a gust of wind would blow into the caf\\u00e9, making the tobacco smoke swirl around, swinging the lamps at the end of their chains and making their flames flicker, and suddenly one could hear the deep booming of a breaking wave and the moaning of the wind.\\nJeremie, his collar unbuttoned, was taking drunkard's poses, one leg outstretched, one arm hanging down and in the other hand holding a domino.\\nThey were alone now with the owner, who had come up to them, interested.\\nHe asked:\\n\\\"Well, Jeremie, how goes it inside? Feel less thirsty after wetting your throat?\\\"\\nJeremie muttered:\\n\\\"The more I wet it, the drier it gets inside.\\\"\\nThe innkeeper cast a sly glance at Mathurin. He said:\\n\\\"And your brother, Mathurin, where's he now?\\\"\\nThe sailor laughed silently:\\n\\\"Don't worry; he's warm, all right.\\\"\\nAnd both of them looked toward Jeremie, who was triumphantly putting down the double six and announcing:\\n\\\"Game!\\\"\\nThen the owner declared:\\n\\\"Well, boys, I'm goin' to bed. I will leave you the lamp and the bottle; there's twenty cents' worth in it. Lock the door when you go, Mathurin, and slip the key under the mat the way you did the other night.\\\"\\nMathurin answered:\\n\\\"Don't worry; it'll be all right.\\\"\\nPaumelle shook hands with his two customers and slowly went up the wooden stairs. For several minutes his heavy step echoed through the little house. Then a loud creaking announced that he had got into bed.\\nThe two men continued to play. From time to time a more violent gust of wind would shake the whole house, and the two drinkers would look up, as though some one were about to enter. Then Mathurin would take the bottle and fill Jeremie's glass. But suddenly the clock over the bar struck twelve. Its hoarse clang sounded like the rattling of saucepans. Then Mathurin got up like a sailor whose watch is over.\\n\\\"Come on, Jeremie, we've got to get out.\\\"\\nThe other man rose to his feet with difficulty, got his balance by leaning on the table, reached the door and opened it while his companion was putting out the light.\\nAs soon as they were in the street Mathurin locked the door and then said:\\n\\\"Well, so long. See you to-morrow night!\\\"\\nAnd he disappeared in the darkness.\\nJeremie took a few steps, staggered, stretched out his hands, met a wall which supported him and began to stumble along. From time to time a gust of wind would sweep through the street, pushing him forward, making him run for a few steps; then, when the wind would die down, he would stop short, having lost his impetus, and once more he would begin to stagger on his unsteady drunkard's legs.\\nHe went instinctively toward his home, just as birds go to their nests. Finally he recognized his door, and began to feel about for the keyhole and tried to put the key in it. Not finding the hole, he began to swear. Then he began to beat on the door with his fists, calling for his wife to come and help him:\\n\\\"Melina! Oh, Melina!\\\"\\nAs he leaned against the door for support, it gave way and opened, and Jeremie, losing his prop, fell inside, rolling on his face into the middle of his room, and he felt something heavy pass over him and escape in the night.\\nHe was no longer moving, dazed by fright, bewildered, fearing the devil, ghosts, all the mysterious beings of darkness, and he waited a long time without daring to move. But when he found out that nothing else was moving, a little reason returned to him, the reason of a drunkard.\\nGently he sat up. Again he waited a long time, and at last, growing bolder, he called:\\n\\\"Melina!\\\"\\nHis wife did not answer.\\nThen, suddenly, a suspicion crossed his darkened mind, an indistinct, vague suspicion. He was not moving; he was sitting there in the dark, trying to gather together his scattered wits, his mind stumbling over incomplete ideas, just as his feet stumbled along.\\nOnce more he asked:\\n\\\"Who was it, Melina? Tell me who it was. I won't hurt you!\\\"\\nHe waited, no voice was raised in the darkness. He was now reasoning with himself out loud.\\n\\\"I'm drunk, all right! I'm drunk! And he filled me up, the dog; he did it, to stop my goin' home. I'm drunk!\\\"\\nAnd he would continue:\\n\\\"Tell me who it was, Melina, or somethin'll happen to you.\\\"\\nAfter having waited again, he went on with the slow and obstinate logic of a drunkard:\\n\\\"He's been keeping me at that loafer Paumelle's place every night, so as to stop my going home. It's some trick. Oh, you damned carrion!\\\"\\nSlowly he got on his knees. A blind fury was gaining possession of him, mingling with the fumes of alcohol.\\nHe continued:\\n\\\"Tell me who it was, Melina, or you'll get a licking--I warn you!\\\"\\nHe was now standing, trembling with a wild fury, as though the alcohol had set his blood on fire. He took a step, knocked against a chair, seized it, went on, reached the bed, ran his hands over it and felt the warm body of his wife.\\nThen, maddened, he roared:\\n\\\"So! You were there, you piece of dirt, and you wouldn't answer!\\\"\\nAnd, lifting the chair, which he was holding in his strong sailor's grip, he swung it down before him with an exasperated fury. A cry burst from the bed, an agonizing, piercing cry. Then he began to thrash around like a thresher in a barn. And soon nothing more moved. The chair was broken to pieces, but he still held one leg and beat away with it, panting.\\nAt last he stopped to ask:\\n\\\"Well, are you ready to tell me who it was?\\\"\\nMelina did not answer.\\nThen tired out, stupefied from his exertion, he stretched himself out on the ground and slept.\\nWhen day came a neighbor, seeing the door open, entered.

At one time he was my most intimate friend, the friend who knows one's thoughts, with whom one passes long, quiet, happy evenings, to whom one tells one's secret love affairs, and who seems to draw out those rare, ingenious, delicate thoughts born of that sympathy that gives a sense of repose.\\nFor years we had scarcely been separated; we had lived, travelled, thought and dreamed together; had liked the same things, had admired the same books, understood the same authors, trembled with the same sensations, and very often laughed at the same individuals, whom we understood completely by merely exchanging a glance.\\nThen he married. He married, quite suddenly, a little girl from the provinces, who had come to Paris in search of a husband. How in the world could that little thin, insipidly fair girl, with her weak hands, her light, vacant eyes, and her clear, silly voice, who was exactly like a hundred thousand marriageable dolls, have picked up that intelligent, clever young fellow? Can any one understand these things? No doubt he had hoped for happiness, simple, quiet and long-enduring happiness, in the arms of a good, tender and faithful woman; he had seen all that in the transparent looks of that schoolgirl with light hair.\\nHe had not dreamed of the fact that an active, living and vibrating man grows weary of everything as soon as he understands the stupid reality, unless, indeed, he becomes so brutalized that he understands nothing whatever.\\nWhat would he be like when I met him again? Still lively, witty, light- hearted and enthusiastic, or in a state of mental torpor induced by provincial life? A man may change greatly in the course of fifteen years!\\nThe train stopped at a small station, and as I got out of the carriage, a stout, a very stout man with red cheeks and a big stomach rushed up to me with open arms, exclaiming: \\\"George!\\\" I embraced him, but I had not recognized him, and then I said, in astonishment: \\\"By Jove! You have not grown thin!\\\" And he replied with a laugh:\\n\\\"What did you expect? Good living, a good table and good nights! Eating and sleeping, that is my existence!\\\"\\nI looked at him closely, trying to discover in that broad face the features I held so dear. His eyes alone had not changed, but I no longer saw the same expression in them, and I said to myself: \\\"If the expression be the reflection of the mind, the thoughts in that head are not what they used to be formerly; those thoughts which I knew so well.\\\"\\nYet his eyes were bright, full of happiness and friendship, but they had not that clear, intelligent expression which shows as much as words the brightness of the intellect. Suddenly he said:\\n\\\"Here are my two eldest children.\\\" A girl of fourteen, who was almost a woman, and a boy of thirteen, in the dress of a boy from a Lycee, came forward in a hesitating and awkward manner, and I said in a low voice: \\\"Are they yours?\\\" \\\"Of course they are,\\\" he replied, laughing. \\\"How many have you?\\\" \\\"Five! There are three more at home.\\\"\\nHe said this in a proud, self-satisfied, almost triumphant manner, and I felt profound pity, mingled with a feeling of vague contempt, for this vainglorious and simple reproducer of his species.\\nI got into a carriage which he drove himself, and we set off through the town, a dull, sleepy, gloomy town where nothing was moving in the streets except a few dogs and two or three maidservants. Here and there a shopkeeper, standing at his door, took off his hat, and Simon returned his salute and told me the man's name; no doubt to show me that he knew all the inhabitants personally, and the thought struck me that he was thinking of becoming a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies, that dream of all those who bury themselves in the provinces.\\nWe were soon out of the town, and the carriage turned into a garden that was an imitation of a park, and stopped in front of a turreted house, which tried to look like a chateau.\\n\\\"That is my den,\\\" said Simon, so that I might compliment him on it. \\\"It is charming,\\\" I replied.\\nA lady appeared on the steps, dressed for company, and with company phrases all ready prepared. She was no longer the light-haired, insipid girl I had seen in church fifteen years previously, but a stout lady in curls and flounces, one of those ladies of uncertain age, without intellect, without any of those things that go to make a woman. In short, she was a mother, a stout, commonplace mother, a human breeding machine which procreates without any other preoccupation but her children and her cook-book.\\nShe welcomed me, and I went into the hall, where three children, ranged according to their height, seemed set out for review, like firemen before a mayor, and I said: \\\"Ah! ah! so there are the others?\\\" Simon, radiant with pleasure, introduced them: \\\"Jean, Sophie and Gontran.\\\"\\nThe door of the drawing-room was open. I went in, and in the depths of an easy-chair, I saw something trembling, a man, an old, paralyzed man. Madame Radevin came forward and said: \\\"This is my grandfather, monsieur; he is eighty-seven.\\\" And then she shouted into the shaking old man's ears: \\\"This is a friend of Simon's, papa.\\\" The old gentleman tried to say \\\"good-day\\\" to me, and he muttered: \\\"Oua, oua, oua,\\\" and waved his hand, and I took a seat saying: \\\"You are very kind, monsieur.\\\"\\nSimon had just come in, and he said with a laugh: \\\"So! You have made grandpapa's acquaintance. He is a treasure, that old man; he is the delight of the children. But he is so greedy that he almost kills himself at every meal; you have no idea what he would eat if he were allowed to do as he pleased. But you will see, you will see. He looks at all the sweets as if they were so many girls. You never saw anything so funny; you will see presently.\\\"\\nI was then shown to my room, to change my dress for dinner, and hearing a great clatter behind me on the stairs, I turned round and saw that all the children were following me behind their father; to do me honor, no doubt.\\nMy windows looked out across a dreary, interminable plain, an ocean of grass, of wheat and of oats, without a clump of trees or any rising ground, a striking and melancholy picture of the life which they must be leading in that house.\\nA bell rang; it was for dinner, and I went downstairs. Madame Radevin took my arm in a ceremonious manner, and we passed into the dining-room. A footman wheeled in the old man in his armchair. He gave a greedy and curious look at the dessert, as he turned his shaking head with difficulty from one dish to the other.\\nSimon rubbed his hands: \\\"You will be amused,\\\" he said; and all the children understanding that I was going to be indulged with the sight of their greedy grandfather, began to laugh, while their mother merely smiled and shrugged her shoulders, and Simon, making a speaking trumpet of his hands, shouted at the old man: \\\"This evening there is sweet creamed rice!\\\" The wrinkled face of the grandfather brightened, and he trembled more violently, from head to foot, showing that he had understood and was very pleased. The dinner began.\\n\\\"Just look!\\\" Simon whispered. The old man did not like the soup, and refused to eat it; but he was obliged to do it for the good of his health, and the footman forced the spoon into his mouth, while the old man blew so energetically, so as not to swallow the soup, that it was scattered like a spray all over the table and over his neighbors. The children writhed with laughter at the spectacle, while their father, who was also amused, said: \\\"Is not the old man comical?\\\"\\nDuring the whole meal they were taken up solely with him. He devoured the dishes on the table with his eyes, and tried to seize them and pull them over to him with his trembling hands. They put them almost within his reach, to see his useless efforts, his trembling clutches at them, the piteous appeal of his whole nature, of his eyes, of his mouth and of his nose as he smelt them, and he slobbered on his table napkin with eagerness, while uttering inarticulate grunts. And the whole family was highly amused at this horrible and grotesque scene.\\nThen they put a tiny morsel on his plate, and he ate with feverish gluttony, in order to get something more as soon as possible, and when the sweetened rice was brought in, he nearly had a fit, and groaned with greediness, and Gontran called out to him:\\n\\\"You have eaten too much already; you can have no more.\\\" And they pretended not to give him any. Then he began to cry; he cried and trembled more violently than ever, while all the children laughed. At last, however, they gave him his helping, a very small piece; and as he ate the first mouthful, he made a comical noise in his throat, and a movement with his neck as ducks do when they swallow too large a morsel, and when he had swallowed it, he began to stamp his feet, so as to get more.\\nI was seized with pity for this saddening and ridiculous Tantalus, and interposed on his behalf:\\n\\\"Come, give him a little more rice!\\\" But Simon replied: \\\"Oh! no, my dear fellow, if he were to eat too much, it would harm him, at his age.\\\"\\nI held my tongue, and thought over those words.

It takes a moment for them to recognize that this is Simon. Simon explains that he has gained weight due to his indulgent lifestyle of good food and sleep. The narrator notices that Simon's eyes haven't changed, but something seems different about his overall expression.\\n\\nSimon then introduces the narrator to his two eldest children, a girl and a boy. The narrator is taken by surprise and asks if they are indeed Simon's children. Simon proudly confirms that he has five children in total. The narrator feels pity and contempt for Simon's seemingly vainglorious pride in reproducing.\\n\\nAs they drive through the town, the narrator observes the dull and sleepy atmosphere. Simon seems to know everyone personally, which makes the narrator suspect that he may be considering a political career.\\n\\nThey arrive at Simon's house, which is an imitation of a grand chateau. Simon's wife, who has dramatically changed since their last meeting, greets them dressed for company. She is now a stout and unremarkable woman, focused solely on her children and cooking.\\n\\nInside the house, the narrator meets Simon's three other children. They are lined up according to height, almost like a military presentation. The family prepares for dinner, and the children eagerly anticipate the arrival of their grandfather.

The narrator is frustrated by the family's logic and questions the purpose of prolonging the grandfather's life if all he has left is the pleasure of food.\\n\\nAfter playing cards, the narrator goes to their room feeling sad and sits by the window thinking about Simon's five children and imagining Simon snoring next to his unattractive wife.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"The protagonist goes to visit his old friend, Simon Radevin, whom he hasn't seen in fifteen years.

Through the caf\\u00e9 windows they could see the Boulevard, crowded with people. They could feel the gentle breezes which are wafted over Paris on warm summer evenings and make you feel like going out somewhere, you care not where, under the trees, and make you dream of moonlit rivers, of fireflies and of larks.\\nOne of the two, Henri Simon, heaved a deep sigh and said:\\n\\\"Ah! I am growing old. It's sad. Formerly, on evenings like this, I felt full of life. Now, I only feel regrets. Life is short!\\\"\\nHe was perhaps forty-five years old, very bald and already growing stout.\\nThe other, Pierre Carnier, a trifle older, but thin and lively, answered:\\n\\\"Well, my boy, I have grown old without noticing it in the least. I have always been merry, healthy, vigorous and all the rest. As one sees oneself in the mirror every day, one does not realize the work of age, for it is slow, regular, and it modifies the countenance so gently that the changes are unnoticeable. It is for this reason alone that we do not die of sorrow after two or three years of excitement. For we cannot understand the alterations which time produces. In order to appreciate them one would have to remain six months without seeing one's own face-- then, oh, what a shock!\\n\\\"And the women, my friend, how I pity the poor beings! All their joy, all their power, all their life, lies in their beauty, which lasts ten years.\\n\\\"As I said, I aged without noticing it; I thought myself practically a youth, when I was almost fifty years old. Not feeling the slightest infirmity, I went about, happy and peaceful.\\n\\\"The revelation of my decline came to me in a simple and terrible manner, which overwhelmed me for almost six months--then I became resigned.\\n\\\"Like all men, I have often been in love, but most especially once.\\n\\\"I met her at the seashore, at Etretat, about twelve years ago, shortly after the war. There is nothing prettier than this beach during the morning bathing hour. It is small, shaped like a horseshoe, framed by high while cliffs, which are pierced by strange holes called the 'Portes,' one stretching out into the ocean like the leg of a giant, the other short and dumpy. The women gather on the narrow strip of sand in this frame of high rocks, which they make into a gorgeous garden of beautiful gowns. The sun beats down on the shores, on the multicolored parasols, on the blue-green sea; and all is gay, delightful, smiling. You sit down at the edge of the water and you watch the bathers. The women come down, wrapped in long bath robes, which they throw off daintily when they reach the foamy edge of the rippling waves; and they run into the water with a rapid little step, stopping from time to time for a delightful little thrill from the cold water, a short gasp.\\n\\\"Very few stand the test of the bath. It is there that they can be judged, from the ankle to the throat. Especially on leaving the water are the defects revealed, although water is a powerful aid to flabby skin.\\n\\\"The first time that I saw this young woman in the water, I was delighted, entranced. She stood the test well. There are faces whose charms appeal to you at first glance and delight you instantly. You seem to have found the woman whom you were born to love. I had that feeling and that shock.\\n\\\"I was introduced, and was soon smitten worse than I had ever been before. My heart longed for her. It is a terrible yet delightful thing thus to be dominated by a young woman. It is almost torture, and yet infinite delight. Her look, her smile, her hair fluttering in the wind, the little lines of her face, the slightest movement of her features, delighted me, upset me, entranced me. She had captured me, body and soul, by her gestures, her manners, even by her clothes, which seemed to take on a peculiar charm as soon as she wore them. I grew tender at the sight of her veil on some piece of furniture, her gloves thrown on a chair. Her gowns seemed to me inimitable. Nobody had hats like hers.\\n\\\"She was married, but her husband came only on Saturday, and left on Monday. I didn't concern myself about him, anyhow. I wasn't jealous of him, I don't know why; never did a creature seem to me to be of less importance in life, to attract my attention less than this man.\\n\\\"But she! how I loved her! How beautiful, graceful and young she was! She was youth, elegance, freshness itself! Never before had I felt so strongly what a pretty, distinguished, delicate, charming, graceful being woman is. Never before had I appreciated the seductive beauty to be found in the curve of a cheek, the movement of a lip, the pinkness of an ear, the shape of that foolish organ called the nose.\\n\\\"This lasted three months; then I left for America, overwhelmed with sadness. But her memory remained in me, persistent, triumphant. From far away I was as much hers as I had been when she was near me. Years passed by, and I did not forget her. The charming image of her person was ever before my eyes and in my heart. And my love remained true to her, a quiet tenderness now, something like the beloved memory of the most beautiful and the most enchanting thing I had ever met in my life.\\n\\\"Twelve years are not much in a lifetime! One does not feel them slip by. The years follow each other gently and quickly, slowly yet rapidly, each one is long and yet so soon over! They add up so rapidly, they leave so few traces behind them, they disappear so completely, that, when one turns round to look back over bygone years, one sees nothing and yet one does not understand how one happens to be so old. It seemed to me, really, that hardly a few months separated me from that charming season on the sands of Etretat.\\n\\\"Last spring I went to dine with some friends at Maisons-Laffitte.\\n\\\"Just as the train was leaving, a big, fat lady, escorted by four little girls, got into my car. I hardly looked at this mother hen, very big, very round, with a face as full as the moon framed in an enormous, beribboned hat.\\n\\\"She was puffing, out of breath from having been forced to walk quickly. The children began to chatter. I unfolded my paper and began to read.\\n\\\"We had just passed Asnieres, when my neighbor suddenly turned to me and said:\\n\\\"'Excuse me, sir, but are you not Monsieur Garnier?'\\n\\\"'Yes, madame.'\\n\\\"Then she began to laugh, the pleased laugh of a good woman; and yet it was sad.\\n\\\"'You do not seem to recognize me.'\\n\\\"I hesitated. It seemed to me that I had seen that face somewhere; but where? when? I answered:\\n\\\"'Yes--and no. I certainly know you, and yet I cannot recall your name.'\\n\\\"She blushed a little:\\n\\\"'Madame Julie Lefevre.'\\n\\\"Never had I received such a shock. In a second it seemed to me as though it were all over with me! I felt that a veil had been torn from my eyes and that I was going to make a horrible and heartrending discovery.\\n\\\"So that was she! That big, fat, common woman, she! She had become the mother of these four girls since I had last seen her. And these little beings surprised me as much as their mother. They were part of her; they were big girls, and already had a place in life. Whereas she no longer counted, she, that marvel of dainty and charming gracefulness. It seemed to me that I had seen her but yesterday, and this is how I found her again! Was it possible? A poignant grief seized my heart; and also a revolt against nature herself, an unreasoning indignation against this brutal, injurious act of destruction.\\n\\\"I looked at her, bewildered. Then I took her hand in mine, and tears came to my eyes. I wept for her lost youth. For I did not know this fat lady.\\n\\\"She was also excited, and stammered:\\n\\\"'I am greatly changed, am I not? What can you expect--everything has its time! You see, I have become a mother, nothing but a good mother. Farewell to the rest, that is over. Oh! I never expected you to recognize me if we met. You, too, have changed. It took me quite a while to be sure that I was not mistaken. Your hair is all white. Just think! Twelve years ago! Twelve years! My oldest girl is already ten.'\\n\\\"I looked at the child. And I recognized in her something of her mother's old charm, but something as yet unformed, something which promised for the future. And life seemed to me as swift as a passing train.\\n\\\"We had reached Maisons-Laffitte. I kissed my old friend's hand. I had found nothing to utter but the most commonplace remarks. I was too much upset to talk.\\n\\\"At night, alone, at home, I stood in front of the mirror for a long time, a very long time. And I finally remembered what I had been, finally saw in my mind's eye my brown mustache, my black hair and the youthful expression of my face. Now I was old.

Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one\\u2019s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.\\n\\nThere was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.\\n\\nWhile the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.\\n\\nIn the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name \\u201cMr. James Dillingham Young.\\u201d\\n\\nThe \\u201cDillingham\\u201d had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called \\u201cJim\\u201d and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.\\n\\nDella finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn\\u2019t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling\\u2014something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.\\n\\nThere was a pier glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.\\n\\nSuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.\\n\\nNow, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim\\u2019s gold watch that had been his father\\u2019s and his grandfather\\u2019s. The other was Della\\u2019s hair. Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty\\u2019s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.\\n\\nSo now Della\\u2019s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.\\n\\nOn went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.\\n\\nWhere she stopped the sign read: \\u201cMme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds.\\u201d One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the \\u201cSofronie.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWill you buy my hair?\\u201d asked Della.\\n\\n\\u201cI buy hair,\\u201d said Madame. \\u201cTake yer hat off and let\\u2019s have a sight at the looks of it.\\u201d\\n\\nDown rippled the brown cascade.\\n\\n\\u201cTwenty dollars,\\u201d said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.\\n\\n\\u201cGive it to me quick,\\u201d said Della.\\n\\nOh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim\\u2019s present.\\n\\nShe found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation\\u2014as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim\\u2019s. It was like him. Quietness and value\\u2014the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.\\n\\nWhen Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends\\u2014a mammoth task.\\n\\nWithin forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.\\n\\n\\u201cIf Jim doesn\\u2019t kill me,\\u201d she said to herself, \\u201cbefore he takes a second look at me, he\\u2019ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do\\u2014oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?\\u201d\\n\\nAt 7 o\\u2019clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.\\n\\nJim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: \\u201cPlease God, make him think I am still pretty.\\u201d\\n\\nThe door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two\\u2014and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.\\n\\nJim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.\\n\\nDella wriggled off the table and went for him.\\n\\n\\u201cJim, darling,\\u201d she cried, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold because I couldn\\u2019t have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It\\u2019ll grow out again\\u2014you won\\u2019t mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say \\u2018Merry Christmas!\\u2019 Jim, and let\\u2019s be happy.

I\\u2019m me without my hair, ain\\u2019t I?\\u201d\\n\\nJim looked about the room curiously.\\n\\n\\u201cYou say your hair is gone?\\u201d he said, with an air almost of idiocy.\\n\\n\\u201cYou needn\\u2019t look for it,\\u201d said Della. \\u201cIt\\u2019s sold, I tell you\\u2014sold and gone, too. It\\u2019s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,\\u201d she went on with sudden serious sweetness, \\u201cbut nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?\\u201d\\n\\nOut of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year\\u2014what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.\\n\\nJim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t make any mistake, Dell,\\u201d he said, \\u201cabout me. I don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you\\u2019ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first.\\u201d\\n\\nWhite fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.\\n\\nFor there lay The Combs\\u2014the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rims\\u2014just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.\\n\\nBut she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: \\u201cMy hair grows so fast, Jim!\\u201d\\n\\nAnd then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, \\u201cOh, oh!\\u201d\\n\\nJim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.\\n\\n\\u201cIsn\\u2019t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You\\u2019ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch.

And immediately, as though in mockery of his scepticism, no further than the second line from the top, his eye was caught by the figure 9,499! Unable to believe his eyes, he hurriedly dropped the paper on his knees without looking to see the number of the ticket, and, just as though some one had given him a douche of cold water, he felt an agreeable chill in the pit of the stomach; tingling and terrible and sweet!\\n\\\"Masha, 9,499 is there!\\\" he said in a hollow voice.\\nHis wife looked at his astonished and panicstricken face, and realized that he was not joking.\\n\\\"9,499?\\\" she asked, turning pale and dropping the folded tablecloth on the table.\\n\\\"Yes, yes . . . it really is there!\\\"\\n\\\"And the number of the ticket?\\\"\\n\\\"Oh yes! There's the number of the ticket too. But stay . . . wait! No, I say! Anyway, the number of our series is there! Anyway, you understand....\\\"\\nLooking at his wife, Ivan Dmitritch gave a broad, senseless smile, like a baby when a bright object is shown it. His wife smiled too; it was as pleasant to her as to him that he only mentioned the series, and did not try to find out the number of the winning ticket. To torment and tantalize oneself with hopes of possible fortune is so sweet, so thrilling!\\n\\\"It is our series,\\\" said Ivan Dmitritch, after a long silence. \\\"So there is a probability that we have won. It's only a probability, but there it is!\\\"\\n\\\"Well, now look!\\\"\\n\\\"Wait a little. We have plenty of time to be disappointed. It's on the second line from the top, so the prize is seventy-five thousand. That's not money, but power, capital! And in a minute I shall look at the list, and there--26! Eh? I say, what if we really have won?\\\"\\nThe husband and wife began laughing and staring at one another in silence. The possibility of winning bewildered them; they could not have said, could not have dreamed, what they both needed that seventy-five thousand for, what they would buy, where they would go. They thought only of the figures 9,499 and 75,000 and pictured them in their imagination, while somehow they could not think of the happiness itself which was so possible.\\nIvan Dmitritch, holding the paper in his hand, walked several times from corner to corner, and only when he had recovered from the first impression began dreaming a little.\\n\\\"And if we have won,\\\" he said--\\\"why, it will be a new life, it will be a transformation! The ticket is yours, but if it were mine I should, first of all, of course, spend twenty-five thousand on real property in the shape of an estate; ten thousand on immediate expenses, new furnishing . . . travelling . . . paying debts, and so on. . . . The other forty thousand I would put in the bank and get interest on it.\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, an estate, that would be nice,\\\" said his wife, sitting down and dropping her hands in her lap.\\n\\\"Somewhere in the Tula or Oryol provinces. . . . In the first place we shouldn't need a summer villa, and besides, it would always bring in an income.\\\"\\nAnd pictures came crowding on his imagination, each more gracious and poetical than the last. And in all these pictures he saw himself well-fed, serene, healthy, felt warm, even hot! Here, after eating a summer soup, cold as ice, he lay on his back on the burning sand close to a stream or in the garden under a lime-tree. . . . It is hot. . . . His little boy and girl are crawling about near him, digging in the sand or catching ladybirds in the grass. He dozes sweetly, thinking of nothing, and feeling all over that he need not go to the office today, tomorrow, or the day after. Or, tired of lying still, he goes to the hayfield, or to the forest for mushrooms, or watches the peasants catching fish with a net. When the sun sets he takes a towel and soap and saunters to the bathing shed, where he undresses at his leisure, slowly rubs his bare chest with his hands, and goes into the water. And in the water, near the opaque soapy circles, little fish flit to and fro and green water-weeds nod their heads. After bathing there is tea with cream and milk rolls. . . . In the evening a walk or vint with the neighbors.\\n\\\"Yes, it would be nice to buy an estate,\\\" said his wife, also dreaming, and from her face it was evident that she was enchanted by her thoughts.\\nIvan Dmitritch pictured to himself autumn with its rains, its cold evenings, and its St. Martin's summer. At that season he would have to take longer walks about the garden and beside the river, so as to get thoroughly chilled, and then drink a big glass of vodka and eat a salted mushroom or a soused cucumber, and then--drink another. . . . The children would come running from the kitchen-garden, bringing a carrot and a radish smelling of fresh earth. . . . And then, he would lie stretched full length on the sofa, and in leisurely fashion turn over the pages of some illustrated magazine, or, covering his face with it and unbuttoning his waistcoat, give himself up to slumber.\\nThe St. Martin's summer is followed by cloudy, gloomy weather. It rains day and night, the bare trees weep, the wind is damp and cold. The dogs, the horses, the fowls--all are wet, depressed, downcast. There is nowhere to walk; one can't go out for days together; one has to pace up and down the room, looking despondently at the grey window. It is dreary!\\nIvan Dmitritch stopped and looked at his wife.\\n\\\"I should go abroad, you know, Masha,\\\" he said.\\nAnd he began thinking how nice it would be in late autumn to go abroad somewhere to the South of France ... to Italy ... to India!\\n\\\"I should certainly go abroad too,\\\" his wife said. \\\"But look at the number of the ticket!\\\"\\n\\\"Wait, wait! ...\\\"\\nHe walked about the room and went on thinking. It occurred to him: what if his wife really did go abroad? It is pleasant to travel alone, or in the society of light, careless women who live in the present, and not such as think and talk all the journey about nothing but their children, sigh, and tremble with dismay over every farthing. Ivan Dmitritch imagined his wife in the train with a multitude of parcels, baskets, and bags; she would be sighing over something, complaining that the train made her head ache, that she had spent so much money.... At the stations he would continually be having to run for boiling water, bread and butter. ...She wouldn't have dinner because of its being too dear....\\n\\\"She would begrudge me every farthing,\\\" he thought, with a glance at his wife. \\\"The lottery ticket is hers, not mine! Besides, what is the use of her going abroad? What does she want there? She would shut herself up in the hotel, and not let me out of her sight.... I know!\\\"\\nAnd for the first time in his life his mind dwelt on the fact that his wife had grown elderly and plain, and that she was saturated through and through with the smell of cooking, while he was still young, fresh, and healthy, and might well have got married again.\\n\\\"Of course, all that is silly nonsense,\\\" he thought; \\\"but...why should she go abroad? What would she make of it? And yet she would go, of course.... I can fancy.... In reality it is all one to her, whether it is Naples or Klin. She would only be in my way. I should be dependent upon her. I can fancy how, like a regular woman, she will lock the money up as soon as she gets it.... She will look after her relations and grudge me every farthing.\\\"\\nIvan Dmitritch thought of her relations. All those wretched brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles would come crawling about as soon as they heard of the winning ticket, would begin whining like beggars, and fawning upon them with oily, hypocritical smiles. Wretched, detestable people! If they were given anything, they would ask for more; while if they were refused, they would swear at them, slander them, and wish them every kind of misfortune.\\nIvan Dmitritch remembered his own relations, and their faces, at which he had looked impartially in the past, struck him now as repulsive and hateful.\\n\\\"They are such reptiles!\\\" he thought.\\nAnd his wife's face, too, struck him as repulsive and hateful. Anger surged up in his heart against her, and he thought malignantly:\\n\\\"She knows nothing about money, and so she is stingy. If she won it she would give me a hundred roubles, and put the rest away under lock and key.\\\"\\nAnd he looked at his wife, not with a smile now, but with hatred. She glanced at him too, and also with hatred and anger. She had her own daydreams, her own plans, her own reflections; she understood perfectly well what her husband's dreams were. She knew who would be the first to try to grab her winnings.\\n\\\"It's very nice making daydreams at other people's expense!\\\" is what her eyes expressed. \\\"No, don't you dare!\\\"\\nHer husband understood her look; hatred began stirring again in his breast, and in order to annoy his wife he glanced quickly, to spite her at the fourth page on the newspaper and read out triumphantly:\\n\\\"Series 9,499, number 46! Not 26!\\\"\\nHatred and hope both disappeared at once, and it began immediately to seem to Ivan Dmitritch and his wife that their rooms were dark and small and low-pitched, that the supper they had been eating was not doing them good, but Lying heavy on their stomachs, that the evenings were long and wearisome. . . .\\n\\\"What the devil's the meaning of it?\\\" said Ivan Dmitritch, beginning to be ill-humored.

For reasons which will presently appear, I will withhold his real name and titles, and call him Lieutenant General Lord Arthur Scoresby, V.C., K.C.B., etc., etc., etc. What a fascination there is in a renowned name! There sat the man, in actual flesh, whom I had heard of so many thousands of times since that day, thirty years before, when his name shot suddenly to the zenith from a Crimean battlefield, to remain forever celebrated. It was food and drink to me to look, and look, and look at that demigod; scanning, searching, noting: the quietness, the reserve, the noble gravity of his countenance; the simple honesty that expressed itself all over him; the sweet unconsciousness of his greatness\\u2014unconsciousness of the hundreds of admiring eyes fastened upon him, unconsciousness of the deep, loving, sincere worship welling out of the breasts of those people and flowing toward him.\\nThe clergyman at my left was an old acquaintance of mine\\u2014clergyman now, but had spent the first half of his life in the camp and field, and as an instructor in the military school at Woolwich. Just at the moment I have been talking about, a veiled and singular light glimmered in his eyes, and he leaned down and muttered confidentially to me\\u2014indicating the hero of the banquet with a gesture:\\n\\\"Privately\\u2014he's an absolute fool.\\\"\\nThis verdict was a great surprise to me. If its subject had been Napoleon, or Socrates, or Solomon, my astonishment could not have been greater. Two things I was well aware of: that the Reverend was a man of strict veracity, and that his judgement of men was good. Therefore I knew, beyond doubt or question, that the world was mistaken about this hero: he was a fool. So I meant to find out, at a convenient moment, how the Reverend, all solitary and alone, had discovered the secret.\\nSome days later the opportunity came, and this is what the Reverend told me.\\nAbout forty years ago I was an instructor in the military academy at Woolwich. I was present in one of the sections when young Scoresby underwent his preliminary examination. I was touched to the quick with pity; for the rest of the class answered up brightly and handsomely, while he\\u2014why, dear me, he didn't know anything, so to speak. He was evidently good, and sweet, and lovable, and guileless; and so it was exceedingly painful to see him stand there, as serene as a graven image, and deliver himself of answers which were veritably miraculous for stupidity and ignorance. All the compassion in me was aroused in his behalf. I said to myself, when he comes to be examined again, he will be flung over, of course; so it will be simply a harmless act of charity to ease his fall as much as I can. I took him aside, and found that he knew a little of C\\u00e6sar's history; and as he didn't know anything else, I went to work and drilled him like a galley slave on a certain line of stock questions concerning C\\u00e6sar which I knew would be used. If you'll believe me, he went through with flying colors on examination day! He went through on that purely superficial \\\"cram,\\\" and got compliments too, while others, who knew a thousand times more than he, got plucked. By some strangely lucky accident\\u2014an accident not likely to happen twice in a century\\u2014he was asked no question outside of the narrow limits of his drill.\\nIt was stupefying. Well, all through his course I stood by him, with something of the sentiment which a mother feels for a crippled child; and he always saved himself\\u2014just by miracle, apparently.\\nNow of course the thing that would expose him and kill him at last was mathematics. I resolved to make his death as easy as I could; so I drilled him and crammed him, and crammed him and drilled him, just on the line of questions which the examiners would be most likely to use, and then launching him on his fate. Well, sir, try to conceive of the result: to my consternation, he took the first prize! And with it he got a perfect ovation in the way of compliments.\\nSleep? There was no more sleep for me for a week. My conscience tortured me day and night. What I had done I had done purely through charity, and only to ease the poor youth's fall\\u2014I never had dreamed of any such preposterous result as the thing that had happened. I felt as guilty and miserable as the creator of Frankenstein. Here was a woodenhead whom I had put in the way of glittering promotions and prodigious responsibilities, and but one thing could happen: he and his responsibilities would all go to ruin together at the first opportunity.\\nThe Crimean war had just broken out. Of course there had to be a war, I said to myself: we couldn't have peace and give this donkey a chance to die before he is found out. I waited for the earthquake. It came. And it made me reel when it did come. He was actually gazetted to a captaincy in a marching regiment! Better men grow old and gray in the service before they climb to a sublimity like that. And who could ever have foreseen that they would go and put such a load of responsibility on such green and inadequate shoulders? I could just barely have stood it if they had made him a cornet; but a captain\\u2014think of it! I thought my hair would turn white.\\nConsider what I did\\u2014I who so loved repose and inaction. I said to myself, I am responsible to the country for this, and I must go along with him and protect the country against him as far as I can. So I took my poor little capital that I had saved up through years of work and grinding economy, and went with a sigh and bought a cornetcy in his regiment, and away we went to the field.\\nAnd there\\u2014oh dear, it was awful. Blunders? Why, he never did anything but blunder. But, you see, nobody was in the fellow's secret\\u2014everybody had him focused wrong, and necessarily misinterpreted his performance every time\\u2014consequently they took his idiotic blunders for inspirations of genius; they did, honestly! His mildest blunders were enough to make a man in his right mind cry; and they did make me cry\\u2014and rage and rave too, privately. And the thing that kept me always in a sweat of apprehension was the fact that every fresh blunder he made increased the luster of his reputation! I kept saying to myself, he'll get so high, that when discovery does finally come, it will be like the sun falling out of the sky.\\nHe went right along up, from grade to grade, over the dead bodies of his superiors, until at last, in the hottest moment of the battle of ------- down went our colonel, and my heart jumped into my mouth, for Scoresby was next in rank! Now for it, said I; we'll all land in Sheol in ten minutes, sure.\\nThe battle was awfully hot; the allies were steadily giving way all over the field. Our regiment occupied a position that was vital; a blunder now must be destruction. At this crucial moment, what does this immortal fool do but detach the regiment from its place and order a charge over a neighboring hill where there wasn't a suggestion of an enemy! \\\"There you go!\\\" I said to myself; \\\"this is the end at last.\\\"\\nAnd away we did go, and were over the shoulder of the hill before the insane movement could be discovered and stopped. And what did we find? An entire and unsuspected Russian army in reserve! And what happened? We were eaten up? That is necessarily what would have happened in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. But no, those Russians argued that no single regiment would come browsing around there at such a time. It must be the entire English army, and that the sly Russian game was detected and blocked; so they turned tail, and away they went, pell-mell, over the hill and down into the field, in wild confusion, and we after them; they themselves broke the solid Russian center in the field, and tore through, and in no time there was the most tremendous rout you ever saw, and the defeat of the allies was turned into a sweeping and splendid victory! Marshal Canrobert looked on, dizzy with astonishment, admiration,and delight; and sent right off for Scoresby, and hugged him, and decorated him on the field, in presence of all the armies!\\nAnd what was Scoresby's blunder that time? Merely the mistaking his right hand for his left\\u2014that was all. An order had come to him to fall back and support our right; and instead, he fell forward and went over the hill to the left. But the name he won that day as a marvelous military genius filled the world with his glory, and that glory will never fade while history books last.\\nHe is just as good and sweet and lovable and unpretending as a man can be, but he doesn't know enough to come in when it rains. Now that is absolutely true. He is the supremest ass in the universe; and until half an hour ago nobody knew it but himself and me. He has been pursued, day by day and year by year, by a most phenomenal and astonishing luckiness. He has been a shining soldier in all our wars for a generation; he has littered his whole military life with blunders, and yet has never committed one that didn't make him a knight or a baronet or a lord or something. Look at his breast; why, he is just clothed in domestic and foreign decorations. Well, sir, every one of them is the record of some shouting stupidity or other; and taken together, they are proof that the very best thing in all this world that can befall a man is to be born lucky.

However, the protagonist is revealed to be a fool by the clergyman sitting next to the narrator. The clergyman had been Scoresby's instructor at the military academy and had witnessed his lack of knowledge and intelligence during his preliminary examination.\\n\\nFeeling pity for Scoresby, the clergyman decided to help him during subsequent examinations by providing him with specific questions and drilling him. Surprisingly, Scoresby managed to pass each examination due to the questions being within the limited scope of his preparation. This pattern continued throughout his military career, with the clergyman always by his side, protecting him from the consequences of his incompetence.\\n\\nDuring the Crimean War, the clergyman went so far as to purchase a position in the same regiment as Scoresby to ensure he could protect him. However, as the war intensifies, the clergyman becomes increasingly anxious about Scoresby's blunders. Despite these mistakes, Scoresby's reputation continues to grow, as others interpret his blunders as strokes of genius.\\n\\nIn a pivotal moment during the battle, Scoresby makes another serious blunder, ordering a charge into an area believed to be without enemies but where an entire Russian army is waiting. Miraculously, the Russian army mistakes the charge for the entire English army and retreats, resulting in a sweeping victory for the allies. Scoresby is hailed as a military genius, and the clergyman's fears are unfounded.\\n\\nThe story concludes with the clergyman acknowledging that Scoresby's luck has been his greatest asset, as every mistake he has made has turned into a grand success.

The protagonist is admired and revered by all present, including the narrator who finds himself in awe of this renowned hero. However, sitting next to the narrator is a clergyman who confidentially reveals that Scoresby is an absolute fool.\\n\\nThe clergyman goes on to explain that many years ago, he was an instructor at a military academy in Woolwich when Scoresby underwent his preliminary examination. The clergyman describes Scoresby as a sweet and likable but ignorant individual, unable to answer basic questions during the examination. Taking pity on him, the clergyman undertakes the task of tutoring Scoresby specifically for the questions that he knows will be asked. Much to his surprise, Scoresby not only passes the examination but also receives high praise and compliments from the examiners.\\n\\nHowever, knowing that mathematics would expose his lack of knowledge, the clergyman prepares Scoresby for his inevitable failure in subject as well. However, Scoresby thoroughly surprises the instructor by not only passing Maths with excellent results, but also obtaining first prize and winning multiple accolades. His further promotions and rise through the ranks continue despite the clergyman's concern that their lack of awareness regarding Scoresby's ineptitude may lead to disastrous consequences.\\n\\nAt the peak of the Crimean war, Scoresby becomes the captaincy of a marching regiment, a feat considered extraordinary for such a novice soldier. Incredibly, he ascends further in rank due to his irrational mistakes being misinterpreted as displays of genius by others.\\n\\nDuring a critical battle, Scoreby's blunder leads to a charge in the wrong direction, thankfully stumbling into a heavily armed, unsuspected Russian army. Yet, through some extraordinary luck, the Russians retreat, allowing the English army to claim a remarkable victory. Scoresby's mistake is again misunderstood as brilliant strategy, raising his reputation even higher.\\n\\nIn the end, the clergyman admits that while Scoresby is genuine, kind, and unassuming, he possesses no actual military intelligence, consistently relying on sheer chance and luck to advance his career. The story concludes with the shocking revelation that Scoresby himself and the clergyman are the only ones aware of his foolishness. Regardless, his luck is seen as a testament to his success, proving that being born lucky is the greatest attribute of all.\", \"story_token_count\": 2368, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 455, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 593}, {\"Title\": \"My Cheesecake-Shaped Poverty\", \"Author\": \"Haruki Murakami\", \"story\": \"The Triangle Zone was our name for the place. I couldn\\u2019t think of any better name for it. I mean, the area was a perfect triangle, as if someone had drawn it out. And she and I lived there, on that land. This was back in 1973 or \\u201974.\\n\\nWhen I say \\u201cTriangle Zone,\\u201d don\\u2019t go picturing a kind of delta. The Triangle Zone we lived in was much narrower, more like a wedge. Imagine, say, a round, full-sized cheesecake. Cut it into twelve equal pieces with a knife so it\\u2019s like the face of a clock. What you\\u2019d end up with, of course, are twelve slices of thirty degrees each at the tip. Place one of these on a plate and, as you sip your tea, take a good hard look at it. That tapered end of the thin slice of cake? That\\u2019s exactly the shape of the Triangle Zone I\\u2019m talking about.\\n\\nO.K., so how did such a weirdly shaped plot of land come about? Well you might ask. Or maybe not. Either way\\u2019s fine with me, since I don\\u2019t know the answer. I asked some of the neighbors about it, but all I found out was that it had been shaped like a triangle long, long ago, was a triangle now, and would probably\\u2014far, far into the future\\u2014remain a triangle. People there didn\\u2019t seem to want to talk about this Triangle Zone, or even think about it. For them, it was like talking about a wart behind your ear. Better left undiscussed. Probably because of its weird shape.\\n\\nRailroad lines ran along either side of the Triangle Zone, one a national railway line, the other a private line. The two lines ran parallel for a while, then at the very tip of the wedge formed a junction where it was as if they were ripped apart, branching off at strange angles, one north and one south. It was quite a sight to see. Whenever I gazed at the trains whizzing by at the tip of the Triangle Zone, I felt as if I were standing on the bridge of a destroyer slicing its way through the ocean waves.\\n\\nIn terms of livability, the Triangle Zone was appalling. First of all, there was the obvious noise level. But what do you expect? How could it not be earsplitting to live hemmed in between two railroad lines? Open the front door and there was a train roaring by; open a window at the back of the house and yet another train would thunder by, right before your eyes. And when I say \\u201cright before your eyes,\\u201d I\\u2019m not exaggerating. The trains were so close that I could look the passengers in the eye and nod a greeting. Really something, now that I think about it.\\n\\nYou\\u2019d assume that it would be quiet after the last train of the night had passed by, right? I thought so, too, before I moved there. Problem was, there was no such thing as a last train. The last passenger train was just before 1 A.M., but then came the late-night freight trains. And, once they\\u2019d finished rolling by, at dawn, the next day\\u2019s passenger trains would start up again. It was an endless repeat of this, day after day.\\n\\nTalk about crazy.\\n\\nWe picked this place to live in for one simple reason: it was dirt cheap. It was a detached house with three rooms, its own bath, and even a small garden, all for about the same price as renting a studio apartment. Since it was a stand-alone house, we could bring our cat along, too. It was as if the place had been specially made, just for us. We\\u2019d only recently got married, and, not to brag or anything, but we could very well have been featured in the Guinness Book of Records under \\u201cWorld\\u2019s Poorest Couple.\\u201d We saw the house listed in the window of a real-estate agent\\u2019s office near the station. At least as far as the rent and the layout of the rooms were concerned, this was a lucky find. Astonishing, even.\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, cheap it is. For sure,\\u201d the bald real-estate agent said. \\u201cBut I have to warn you\\u2014it\\u2019s really noisy. As long as you can stand that, you could call it a lucky find.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWould you mind showing it to us?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cSure. But can\\u2019t the two of you just go? I get a headache every time I go to that place.\\u201d\\n\\nHe handed me the keys and drew a map. What an easygoing agent.\\n\\nOn the map, the Triangle Zone didn\\u2019t look far from the station, but, when we actually walked to it, it took forever. We had to detour around the railroad tracks, cross an overpass, and trudge up and down a somewhat filthy hill before we finally arrived at the rear of the Triangle Zone. There wasn\\u2019t a store in sight. A totally seedy neighborhood.\\n\\nMy wife and I went into the house at the very tip of the Triangle Zone and stayed for about an hour, just hanging out. During this time, trains kept on rumbling past. Whenever an express train roared by, the windows would rattle. We couldn\\u2019t hear each other while a train was passing. We\\u2019d be talking and then would have to stop until it was gone. We\\u2019d resume talking when it got quiet, only to be interrupted a moment later by yet another train. Choppy, interrupted communication \\u00e0 la Jean-Luc Godard.\\n\\nAside from the noise, the house wasn\\u2019t so bad. The structure itself was old-fashioned and in need of some serious repair, but on the plus side it had a tokonoma recessed alcove and a small outside sitting area attached to the house, and had a nice feel to it. Spring light shining in through the windows formed little sunny squares on the tatami. It was a lot like the house I\\u2019d lived in, years ago, when I was little. \\u201cLet\\u2019s take it,\\u201d I said. \\u201cI know it\\u2019s noisy, but we\\u2019ll get used to it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIf that\\u2019s what you think, I\\u2019m O.K. with it,\\u201d she said.\\n\\n\\u201cSitting here together like this, it feels like we\\u2019re married, our own family.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, we are married.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, yeah. True enough,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nWe went back to the real-estate agency and told the bald agent that we\\u2019d take it.\\n\\n\\u201cIsn\\u2019t it too noisy?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, it is, but we\\u2019ll get used to it,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nThe agent took off his glasses, wiped them with a tissue, took a sip of tea from his teacup, put his glasses back on, and looked at me.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, \\u2019cause you\\u2019re young,\\u201d he said.\\n\\n\\u201cRight,\\u201d I replied.\\n\\nAnd we filled out the rental agreement.\\n\\nA friend\\u2019s little minivan was more than enough for our move. Futons, clothes, a lamp, a few books, and a cat\\u2014that was the extent of our belongings. Nothing else. No radio or TV. No washer or dining table or gas stove or telephone or kettle or vacuum cleaner. That was how poor we were. So our move, such as it was, took only half an hour. Life can be simpler if you don\\u2019t have much money.\\n\\nWhen the friend who helped us move took one look at our new dwelling, hemmed in by railroad lines, he was aghast. After we\\u2019d unloaded everything, he turned to me and said something, but a passing express train drowned out his words.\\n\\n\\u201cDid you say something?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople really live in a place like this, huh?\\u201d he commented, impressed.\\n\\nWe ended up living in that house for two years.\\n\\nIt was a poorly built house in a way, since wind blew in through cracks and gaps all over the place. Pleasant enough in the summer, but, come winter, it was hell. With no money to buy a space heater, my wife and I and the cat would crawl under the futons once the sun set, literally clinging to each other to keep warm. Many a time we\\u2019d wake up to find the water in the kitchen faucet frozen solid.\\n\\nOnce winter passed, the spring would come. And spring was a lovely season. She and I and the cat would breathe a sigh of relief. In April, the railroads went on strike for a few days, and we were ecstatic. Not a single train came rumbling by all day. We carried the cat down to the railroad tracks and sat there sunning ourselves. It was so quiet it was as if we were sitting at the bottom of a lake.

Madame Henriette had allowed her husband to return alone to their estate in Calvados, where some business required his attention, and had come to spend a few days in Paris with her sister. Night came on. In the quiet parlor Madame Roubere was reading in the twilight in an absent-minded way, raising her eyes whenever she heard a sound.\\nAt last, she heard a ring at the door, and her sister appeared, wrapped in a travelling cloak. And without any formal greeting, they clasped each other in an affectionate embrace, only desisting for a moment to give each other another hug. Then they talked about their health, about their respective families, and a thousand other things, gossiping, jerking out hurried, broken sentences as they followed each other about, while Madame Henriette was removing her hat and veil.\\nIt was now quite dark. Madame Roubere rang for a lamp, and as soon as it was brought in, she scanned her sister's face, and was on the point of embracing her once more. But she held back, scared and astonished at the other's appearance.\\nOn her temples Madame Letore had two large locks of white hair. All the rest of her hair was of a glossy, raven-black hue; but there alone, at each side of her head, ran, as it were, two silvery streams which were immediately lost in the black mass surrounding them. She was, nevertheless, only twenty-four years old, and this change had come on suddenly since her departure for Switzerland.\\nWithout moving, Madame Roubere gazed at her in amazement, tears rising to her eyes, as she thought that some mysterious and terrible calamity must have befallen her sister. She asked:\\n\\\"What is the matter with you, Henriette?\\\"\\nSmiling with a sad face, the smile of one who is heartsick, the other replied:\\n\\\"Why, nothing, I assure you. Were you noticing my white hair?\\\"\\nBut Madame Roubere impetuously seized her by the shoulders, and with a searching glance at her, repeated:\\n\\\"What is the matter with you? Tell me what is the matter with you. And if you tell me a falsehood, I'll soon find it out.\\\"\\nThey remained face to face, and Madame Henriette, who looked as if she were about to faint, had two pearly tears in the corners of her drooping eyes.\\nHer sister continued:\\n\\\"What has happened to you? What is the matter with you? Answer me!\\\"\\nThen, in a subdued voice, the other murmured:\\n\\\"I have--I have a lover.\\\"\\nAnd, hiding her forehead on the shoulder of her younger sister, she sobbed.\\nThen, when she had grown a little calmer, when the heaving of her breast had subsided, she commenced to unbosom herself, as if to cast forth this secret from herself, to empty this sorrow of hers into a sympathetic heart.\\nThereupon, holding each other's hands tightly clasped, the two women went over to a sofa in a dark corner of the room, into which they sank, and the younger sister, passing her arm over the elder one's neck, and drawing her close to her heart, listened.\\n\\\"Oh! I know that there was no excuse for me; I do not understand myself, and since that day I feel as if I were mad. Be careful, my child, about yourself--be careful! If you only knew how weak we are, how quickly we yield, and fall. It takes so little, so little, so little, a moment of tenderness, one of those sudden fits of melancholy which come over you, one of those longings to open, your arms, to love, to cherish something, which we all have at certain moments.\\n\\\"You know my husband, and you know how fond I am of him; but he is mature and sensible, and cannot even comprehend the tender vibrations of a woman's heart. He is always the same, always good, always smiling, always kind, always perfect. Oh! how I sometimes have wished that he would clasp me roughly in his arms, that he would embrace me with those slow, sweet kisses which make two beings intermingle, which are like mute confidences! How I have wished that he were foolish, even weak, so that he should have need of me, of my caresses, of my tears!\\n\\\"This all seems very silly; but we women are made like that. How can we help it?\\n\\\"And yet the thought of deceiving him never entered my mind. Now it has happened, without love, without reason, without anything, simply because the moon shone one night on the Lake of Lucerne.\\n\\\"During the month when we were travelling together, my husband, with his calm indifference, paralyzed my enthusiasm, extinguished my poetic ardor. When we were descending the mountain paths at sunrise, when as the four horses galloped along with the diligence, we saw, in the transparent morning haze, valleys, woods, streams, and villages, I clasped my hands with delight, and said to him: 'How beautiful it is, dear! Give me a kiss! Kiss me now!' He only answered, with a smile of chilling kindliness: 'There is no reason why we should kiss each other because you like the landscape.'\\n\\\"And his words froze me to the heart. It seems to me that when people love each other, they ought to feel more moved by love than ever, in the presence of beautiful scenes.\\n\\\"In fact, I was brimming over with poetry which he kept me from expressing. I was almost like a boiler filled with steam and hermetically sealed.\\n\\\"One evening (we had for four days been staying in a hotel at Fluelen) Robert, having one of his sick headaches, went to bed immediately after dinner, and I went to take a walk all alone along the edge of the lake.\\n\\\"It was a night such as one reads of in fairy tales. The full moon showed itself in the middle of the sky; the tall mountains, with their snowy crests, seemed to wear silver crowns; the waters of the lake glittered with tiny shining ripples. The air was mild, with that kind of penetrating warmth which enervates us till we are ready to faint, to be deeply affected without any apparent cause. But how sensitive, how vibrating the heart is at such moments! how quickly it beats, and how intense is its emotion!\\n\\\"I sat down on the grass, and gazed at that vast, melancholy, and fascinating lake, and a strange feeling arose in me; I was seized with an insatiable need of love, a revolt against the gloomy dullness of my life. What! would it never be my fate to wander, arm in arm, with a man I loved, along a moon-kissed bank like this? Was I never to feel on my lips those kisses so deep, delicious, and intoxicating which lovers exchange on nights that seem to have been made by God for tenderness? Was I never to know ardent, feverish love in the moonlit shadows of a summer's night?\\n\\\"And I burst out weeping like a crazy woman. I heard something stirring behind me. A man stood there, gazing at me.

H. Munro\", \"story\": \"Theodoric Voler had been brought up, from infancy to the confines of middle age, by a fond mother whose chief solicitude had been to keep him screened from what she called the coarser realities of life. When she died she left Theodoric alone in a world that was as real as ever, and a good deal coarser than he considered it had any need to be. To a man of his temperament and upbringing even a simple railway journey was crammed with petty annoyances and minor discords, and as he settled himself down in a second-class compartment one September morning he was conscious of ruffled feelings and general mental discomposure. He had been staying at a country vicarage, the inmates of which had been certainly neither brutal nor bacchanalian, but their supervision of the domestic establishment had been of that lax order which invites disaster. The pony carriage that was to take him to the station had never been properly ordered, and when the moment for his departure drew near, the handyman who should have produced the required article was nowhere to be found. In this emergency Theodoric, to his mute but very intense disgust, found himself obliged to collaborate with the vicar's daughter in the task of harnessing the pony, which necessitated groping about in an ill-lighted outbuilding called a stable, and melling very like one--except in patches where it smelled of mice. Without being actually afraid of mice, Theodoric classed them among the coarser incidents of life, and considered that Providence, with a little exercise of moral courage, might long ago have recognized that they were not indispensable, and have withdrawn them from circulation. As the train glided out of the station Theodoric's nervous imagination accused himself of exhaling a weak odor of stable yard, and possibly of displaying a moldy straw or two on his unusually well-brushed garments. Fortunately the only other occupation of the compartment, a lady of about the same age as himself, seemed inclined for slumber rather than scrutiny; the train was not due to stop till the terminus was reached, in about an hour's time, and the carriage was of the oId-fashioned sort that held no communication with a corridor, therefore no further traveling companions were likely to intrude on Theodoric's semiprivacy. And yet the train had scarcely attained its normal speed before he became reluctantly but vividly aware that he was not alone with the slumbering lady; he was not even alone in his own clothes. A warm, creeping movement over his flesh betrayed the unwelcome and highly resented presence, unseen but poignant, of a strayed mouse, that had evidently dashed into its present retreat during the episode of the pony harnessing. Furtive stamps and shakes and wildly directed pinches failed to dislodge the intruder, whose motto, indeed, seemed to be Excelsior; and the lawful occupant of the clothes lay back against the cushions and endeavored rapidly to evolve some means for putting an end to the dual ownership. It was unthinkable that he should continue for the space of a whole hour in the horrible position of a Rowton House for vagrant mice already his imagination had at least doubled the numbers of the alien invasion. On the other hand, nothing less drastic than partial disrobing would ease him of his tormentor, and to undress in the presence of a lady, even for so laudable a purpose, was an idea that made his ear tips tingle in a blush of abject shame. He had never heen able to bring himself even to the mild exposure of openwork socks in the presence of the fair sex. And yet--the lady in this case was to all appearances soundly and securely asleep; the mouse, on the other hand, seemed to be trying to crowd a wanderjahr into a few strenuous minutes. If there is any truth in the theory of transmigration, this particular mouse must certainly have been in a former state a member of the Alpine Club. Sometimes in its eagerness it lost its footing and slipped for half an inch or so; and then, in fright, or more probably temper, it bit. Theodoric was goaded into the most audacious undertaking of his life. Crimsoning to the hue of a beetroot and keeping an agonized watch on his slumbering fellow traveler, he swiftly and noiselessly secured the ends of his railway rug to the racks on either side of the carriage, so that a substantial curtain hung athwart the compartment. In the narrow dressing room that he had thus improvised he proceeded with violent haste to extricate himself partially and the mouse entirely from the surrounding casings of tweed and half-wool. As the unraveled mouse gave a wild leap to the floor, the rug, slipping its fastening at either end, also came down with a heart-curdling flop, and almost simultaneously the awakened sleeper opened her eyes. With a movement almost quicker than the mouse's, Theodoric pounced on the rug and hauled its ample folds chin-high over his dismantled person as he collapsed into the farther corner of the carriage. The blood raced and beat in the veins of his neck and forehead, while he waited dumbly for the communication cord to be pulled. The lady, however, contented herself with a silent stare at her strangely muffled companion. How much had she seen, Theodoric queried to himself; and in any case what on earth must she think of his present posture?\\n\\\"I think I have caught a chill,\\\" he ventured desperately.\\n\\\"Really, I'm sorry,\\\" she replied. \\\"I was just going to ask you if you would open this window.\\\"\\n\\\"I fancy it's malaria,\\\" he added, his teeth chattering slightly, as much from fright as from a desire to support his theory.\\n\\\"I've got some brandy in my holdall, if you'll kindly reach it down for me,\\\" said his companion.\\n\\\"Not for worlds--I mean, I never take anything for it,\\\" he assured her earnestly.\\n\\\"I suppose you caught it in the tropics?\\\"\\nTheodoric, whose acquaintance with the tropics was limited to an annual present of a chest of tea from an uncle in Ceylon, felt that even the malaria was slipping from him. Would it be possible, he wondered to disclose the real state of affairs to her in small installments?\\n\\\"Are you afraid of mice?\\\" he ventured, growing, if possible, more scarlet in the face.\\n\\\"Not unless they came in quantities. Why do you ask?\\\"\\n\\\"I had one crawling inside my clothes just now,\\\" said Theodoric in a voice that hardly seemed his own. \\\"It was a most awkward situation.\\\"\\n\\\"It must have been, if you wear your clothes at all tight,\\\" she observed. \\\"But mice have strange ideas of comfort.\\\"\\n\\\"I had to get rid of it while you were asleep,\\\" he continued. Then, with a gulp, he added, \\\"It was getting rid of it that brought me to-to this.\\\"\\n\\\"Surely leaving off one small mouse wouldn't bring on a chill,\\\" she exclaimed, with a levity that Theodoric accounted abominable.\\nEvidently she had detected something of his predicament, and was enjoying his confusion. All the blood in his body seemed to have mobilized in one concentrated blush, and an agony of abasement, worse than a myriad mice, crept up and down over his soul. And then, as reflection began to assert itself, sheer terror took the place of humiliation. With every minute that passed the train was rushing nearer to the crowded and bustling terminus, where dozens of prying eyes would be exchanged for the one paralyzing pair that watched him from the farther corner of the carriage. There was one slender, despairing chance, which the next few minutes must decide. His fellow traveler might relapse into a blessed slumber. But as the minutes throbbed by that chance ebbed away. The furtive glance which Theodoric stole at her from time to time disclosed only an unwinking wakefulness.\\n\\\"I think we must be getting near now,\\\" she presently observed.\\nTheodoric had already noted with growing terror the recurring stacks of small, ugly dwellings that heralded the journey's end. The words acted as a signal. Like a hunted beast breaking cover and dashing madly toward some other haven of momentary safety he threw aside his rug, and struggled frantically into his disheveled garments. He was conscious of dull suburban stations racing past the window, of a choking, hammering sensation in his throat and heart, and of an icy silence in that corner toward which he dared not look. Then as he sank back in his seat, clothed and almost delirious, the train slowed down to a final crawl, and the woman spoke.\\n\\\"Would you be so kind,\\\" she asked, \\\"as to get me a porter to put me into a cab? It's a shame to trouble you when you're feeling unwell, but being blind makes one so helpless at a railway station.\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Theodoric Voler, a man who has been sheltered from the harsh realities of life, finds himself on a train journey filled with annoyances.

He desperately tries to remove it without alerting the sleeping lady in the compartment with him. In a panic, he creates a makeshift curtain using his rug and partially undresses to get rid of the mouse. However, the rug falls and the lady wakes up, leaving Theodoric in an embarrassing and compromising situation. But instead of mocking him, she calmly offers him brandy for his supposed chill.

H. Munro\", \"story\": \"It was Mrs. Packletide's pleasure and intention that she should shoot a tiger. Not that the lust to kill had suddenly descended on her, or that she felt that she would leave India safer and more wholesome than she had found it, with one fraction less of wild beast per million of inhabitants. The compelling motive for her sudden deviation towards the footsteps of Nimrod was the fact that Loona Bimberton had recently been carried eleven miles in an aeroplane by an Algerian aviator, and talked of nothing else; only a personally procured tiger-skin and a heavy harvest of Press photographs could successfully counter that sort of thing. Mrs. Packletide had already arranged in her mind the lunch she would give at her house in Curzon Street, ostensibly in Loona Bimberton's honour, with a tiger-skin rug occupying most of the foreground and all of the conversation. She had also already designed in her mind the tiger-claw broach that she was going to give Loona Bimberton on her next birthday. In a world that is supposed to be chiefly swayed by hunger and by love Mrs. Packletide was an exception; her movements and motives were largely governed by dislike of Loona Bimberton.\\nCircumstances proved propitious. Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without over-much risk or exertion, and it so happened that a neighbouring village could boast of being the favoured rendezvous of an animal of respectable antecedents, which had been driven by the increasing infirmities of age to abandon game-killing and confine its appetite to the smaller domestic animals. The prospect of earning the thousand rupees had stimulated the sporting and commercial instinct of the villagers; children were posted night and day on the outskirts of the local jungle to head the tiger back in the unlikely event of his attempting to roam away to fresh hunting-grounds, and the cheaper kinds of goats were left about with elaborate carelessness to keep him satisfied with his present quarters. The one great anxiety was lest he should die of old age before the date appointed for the memsahib's shoot. Mothers carrying their babies home through the jungle after the day's work in the fields hushed their singing lest they might curtail the restful sleep of the venerable herd-robber.\\nThe great night duly arrived, moonlit and cloudless. A platform had been constructed in a comfortable and conveniently placed tree, and thereon crouched Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin. A goat, gifted with a particularly persistent bleat, such as even a partially deaf tiger might be reasonably expected to hear on a still night, was tethered at the correct distance. With an accurately sighted rifle and a thumb-nail pack of patience cards the sportswoman awaited the coming of the quarry.\\n\\\"I suppose we are in some danger?\\\" said Miss Mebbin.\\nShe was not actually nervous about the wild beast, but she had a morbid dread of performing an atom more service than she had been paid for.\\n\\\"Nonsense,\\\" said Mrs. Packletide; \\\"it's a very old tiger. It couldn't spring up here even if it wanted to.\\\"\\n\\\"If it's an old tiger I think you ought to get it cheaper. A thousand rupees is a lot of money.\\\"\\nLouisa Mebbin adopted a protective elder-sister attitude towards money in general, irrespective of nationality or denomination. Her energetic intervention had saved many a rouble from dissipating itself in tips in some Moscow hotel, and francs and centimes clung to her instinctively under circumstances which would have driven them headlong from less sympathetic hands. Her speculations as to the market depreciation of tiger remnants were cut short by the appearance on the scene of the animal itself. As soon as it caught sight of the tethered goat it lay flat on the earth, seemingly less from a desire to take advantage of all available cover than for the purpose of snatching a short rest before commencing the grand attack.\\n\\\"I believe it's ill,\\\" said Louisa Mebbin, loudly in Hindustani, for the benefit of the village headman, who was in ambush in a neighbouring tree.\\n\\\"Hush!\\\" said Mrs. Packletide, and at that moment the tiger commenced ambling towards his victim.\\n\\\"Now, now!\\\" urged Miss Mebbin with some excitement; \\\"if he doesn't touch the goat we needn't pay for it.\\\" (The bait was an extra.)\\nThe rifle flashed out with a loud report, and the great tawny beast sprang to one side and then rolled over in the stillness of death. In a moment a crowd of excited natives had swarmed on to the scene, and their shouting speedily carried the glad news to the village, where a thumping of tom-toms took up the chorus of triumph. And their triumph and rejoicing found a ready echo in the heart of Mrs. Packletide; already that luncheon-party in Curzon Street seemed immeasurably nearer.\\nIt was Louisa Mebbin who drew attention to the fact that the goat was in death-throes from a mortal bullet-wound, while no trace of the rifle's deadly work could be found on the tiger. Evidently the wrong animal had been hit, and the beast of prey had succumbed to heart-failure, caused by the sudden report of the rifle, accelerated by senile decay. Mrs. Packletide was pardonably annoyed at the discovery; but, at any rate, she was the possessor of a dead tiger, and the villagers, anxious for their thousand rupees, gladly connived at the fiction that she had shot the beast. And Miss Mebbin was a paid companion. Therefore did Mrs. Packletide face the cameras with a light heart, and her pictured fame reached from the pages of the Texas Weekly Snapshot to the illustrated Monday supplement of the Novoe Vremya. As for Loona Bimberton, she refused to look at an illustrated paper for weeks, and her letter of thanks for the gift of a tiger-claw brooch was a model of repressed emotions. The luncheon-party she declined; there are limits beyond which repressed emotions become dangerous.\\nFrom Curzon Street the tiger-skin rug travelled down to the Manor House, and was duly inspected and admired by the county, and it seemed a fitting and appropriate thing when Mrs. Packletide went to the County Costume Ball in the character of Diana. She refused to fall in, however, with Clovis's tempting suggestion of a primeval dance party, at which every one should wear the skins of beasts they had recently slain. \\\"I should be in rather a Baby Bunting condition,\\\" confessed Clovis, \\\"with a miserable rabbit-skin or two to wrap up in, but then,\\\" he added, with a rather malicious glance at Diana's proportions, \\\"my figure is quite as good as that Russian dancing boy's.\\\"\\n\\\"How amused every one would be if they knew what really happened,\\\" said Louisa Mebbin a few days after the ball.\\n\\\"What do you mean?\\\" asked Mrs. Packletide quickly.\\n\\\"How you shot the goat and frightened the tiger to death,\\\" said Miss Mebbin, with her disagreeably pleasant laugh.\\n\\\"No one would believe it,\\\" said Mrs. Packletide, her face changing colour as rapidly as though it were going through a book of patterns before post-time.\\n\\\"Loona Bimberton would,\\\" said Miss Mebbin. Mrs. Packletide's face settled on an unbecoming shade of greenish white.\\n\\\"You surely wouldn't give me away?\\\" she asked.\\n\\\"I've seen a week-end cottage near Darking that I should rather like to buy,\\\" said Miss Mebbin with seeming irrelevance. \\\"Six hundred and eighty, freehold. Quite a bargain, only I don't happen to have the money.\\\"\\n*\\nLouisa Mebbin's pretty week-end cottage, christened by her \\\"Les Fauves,\\\" and gay in summer-time with its garden borders of tiger-lilies, is the wonder and admiration of her friends.\\n\\\"It is a marvel how Louisa manages to do it,\\\" is the general verdict.\\nMrs. Packletide indulges in no more big-game shooting.\\n\\\"The incidental expenses are so heavy,\\\" she confides to inquiring friends.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Mrs. Packletide, driven by her dislike for Loona Bimberton's recent fame, decides to shoot a tiger in order to outdo Loona. She offers a thousand rupees for the opportunity to shoot a tiger, and the villagers in a neighboring village set up a plan to attract an old tiger to their area. On the night of the hunt, Mrs. Packletide and her companion, Louisa Mebbin, wait in a tree with a tethered goat as bait. Mrs. Packletide successfully shoots a tiger, but it is later discovered that the tiger died from a heart attack caused by the sound of the rifle, and not from the gunshot wound. However, the villagers and Mrs. Packletide keep up the fiction that she shot the tiger, and she becomes famous for her accomplishment. Loona Bimberton, resentful of Mrs. Packletide's success, refuses to accept a tiger-claw brooch as a gift and declines an invitation to a lunch party. Mrs. Packletide displays the tiger-skin rug and attends a costume ball dressed as Diana. Louisa Mebbin, Mrs. Packletide's paid companion, later threatens to expose the truth about the hunt, but instead uses her insider knowledge to purchase a cottage.

Villagers keep the tiger nearby with domestic goats as prey until the scheduled hunt arrives. On the night of the hunt, Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin, hide in a tree with a goat tethered at a suitable distance. Baited by the goat, the tiger approaches, and Mrs. Packletide shoots it.

Aurelio Escovar, a dentist without a degree, and a very early riser, opened his office at six. He took some false teeth, still mounted in their plaster mold, out of the glass case and put on the table a fistful of instruments which he arranged in size order, as if they were on display. He wore a collarless striped shirt, closed at the neck with a golden stud, and pants held up by suspenders He was erect and skinny, with a look that rarely corresponded to the situation, the way deaf people have of looking.\\nWhen he had things arranged on the table, he pulled the drill toward the dental chair and sat down to polish the false teeth. He seemed not to be thinking about what he was doing, but worked steadily, pumping the drill with his feet, even when he didn't need it.\\nAfter eight he stopped for a while to look at the sky through the window, and he saw two pensive buzzards who were drying themselves in the sun on the ridgepole of the house next door. He went on working with the idea that before lunch it would rain again. The shrill voice of his elevenyear-old son interrupted his concentration.\\n\\\"Papa.\\\"\\n\\\"What?\\\"\\n\\\"The Mayor wants to know if you'll pull his tooth.\\\"\\n\\\"Tell him I'm not here.\\\"\\nHe was polishing a gold tooth. He held it at arm's length, and examined it with his eyes half closed. His son shouted again from the little waiting room.\\n\\\"He says you are, too, because he can hear you.\\\"\\nThe dentist kept examining the tooth. Only when he had put it on the table with the finished work did he say:\\n\\\"So much the better.\\\"\\nHe operated the drill again. He took several pieces of a bridge out of a cardboard box where he kept the things he still had to do and began to polish the gold.\\n\\\"Papa.\\\"\\n\\\"What?\\\"\\nHe still hadn't changed his expression.\\n\\\"He says if you don't take out his tooth, he'll shoot you.\\\"\\nWithout hurrying, with an extremely tranquil movement, he stopped pedaling the drill, pushed it away from the chair, and pulled the lower drawer of the table all the way out. There was a revolver. \\\"O.K.,\\\" he said. \\\"Tell him to come and shoot me.\\\"\\nHe rolled the chair over opposite the door, his hand resting on the edge of the drawer. The Mayor appeared at the door. He had shaved the left side of his face, but the other side, swollen and in pain, had a five-day-old beard. The dentist saw many nights of desperation in his dull eyes. He closed the drawer with his fingertips and said softly:\\n\\\"Sit down.\\\"\\n\\\"Good morning,\\\" said the Mayor.\\n\\\"Morning,\\\" said the dentist.\\nWhile the instruments were boiling, the Mayor leaned his skull on the headrest of the chair and felt better. His breath was icy. It was a poor office: an old wooden chair, the pedal drill, a glass case with ceramic bottles. Opposite the chair was a window with a shoulder-high cloth curtain. When he felt the dentist approach, the Mayor braced his heels and opened his mouth.\\nAurelio Escovar turned his head toward the light. After inspecting the infected tooth, he closed the Mayor's jaw with a cautious pressure of his fingers.\\n\\\"It has to be without anesthesia,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"Why?\\\"\\n\\\"Because you have an abscess.\\\"\\nThe Mayor looked him in the eye. \\\"All right,\\\" he said, and tried to smile. The dentist did not return the smile. He brought the basin of sterilized instruments to the worktable and took them out of the water with a pair of cold tweezers, still without hurrying. Then he pushed the spittoon with the tip of his shoe, and went to wash his hands in the washbasin. He did all this without looking at the Mayor. But the Mayor didn't take his eyes off him.\\nIt was a lower wisdom tooth. The dentist spread his feet and grasped the tooth with the hot forceps. The Mayor seized the arms of the chair, braced his feet with all his strength, and felt an icy void in his kidneys, but didn't make a sound. The dentist moved only his wrist. Without rancor, rather with a bitter tenderness, he said:\\n\\\"Now you'll pay for our twenty dead men.\\\"\\nThe Mayor felt the crunch of bones in his jaw, and his eyes filled with tears. But he didn't breathe until he felt the tooth come out. Then he saw it through his tears. It seemed so foreign to his pain that he failed to understand his torture of the five previous nights.\\nBent over the spittoon, sweating, panting, he unbuttoned his tunic and reached for the handkerchief in his pants pocket. The dentist gave him a clean cloth.\\n\\\"Dry your tears,\\\" he said.\\nThe Mayor did. He was trembling. While the dentist washed his hands, he saw the crumbling ceiling and a dusty spider web with spider's eggs and dead insects. The dentist returned, drying his hands. \\\"Go to bed,\\\" he said, \\\"and gargle with salt water.\\\" The Mayor stood up, said goodbye with a casual military salute, and walked toward the door, stretching his legs, without buttoning up his tunic.\\n\\\"Send the bill,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"To you or the town?\\\"\\nThe Mayor didn't look at him.

There the warden handed Jimmy his pardon, which had been signed that morning by the governor. Jimmy took it in a tired kind of way. He had served nearly ten months of a four year sentence. He had expected to stay only about three months, at the longest. When a man with as many friends on the outside as Jimmy Valentine had is received in the \\\"stir\\\" it is hardly worth while to cut his hair.\\n\\n\\\"Now, Valentine,\\\" said the warden, \\\"you'll go out in the morning. Brace up, and make a man of yourself. You're not a bad fellow at heart. Stop cracking safes, and live straight.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me?\\\" said Jimmy, in surprise. \\\"Why, I never cracked a safe in my life.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" laughed the warden. \\\"Of course not. Let's see, now. How was it you happened to get sent up on that Springfield job? Was it because you wouldn't prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high-toned society? Or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you? It's always one or the other with you innocent victims.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me?\\\" said Jimmy, still blankly virtuous. \\\"Why, warden, I never was in Springfield in my life!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Take him back, Cronin!\\\" said the warden, \\\"and fix him up with outgoing clothes. Unlock him at seven in the morning, and let him come to the bull-pen. Better think over my advice, Valentine.\\\"\\n\\nAt a quarter past seven on the next morning Jimmy stood in the warden's outer office. He had on a suit of the villainously fitting, ready-made clothes and a pair of the stiff, squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests.\\n\\nThe clerk handed him a railroad ticket and the five-dollar bill with which the law expected him to rehabilitate himself into good citizenship and prosperity. The warden gave him a cigar, and shook hands. Valentine, 9762, was chronicled on the books, \\\"Pardoned by Governor,\\\" and Mr. James Valentine walked out into the sunshine.\\n\\nDisregarding the song of the birds, the waving green trees, and the smell of the flowers, Jimmy headed straight for a restaurant. There he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine\\u2014followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him. From there he proceeded leisurely to the depot. He tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door, and boarded his train. Three hours set him down in a little town near the state line. He went to the caf\\u00e9 of one Mike Dolan and shook hands with Mike, who was alone behind the bar.\\n\\n\\\"Sorry we couldn't make it sooner, Jimmy, me boy,\\\" said Mike. \\\"But we had that protest from Springfield to buck against, and the governor nearly balked. Feeling all right?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Fine,\\\" said Jimmy. \\\"Got my key?\\\"\\n\\nHe got his key and went upstairs, unlocking the door of a room at the rear. Everything was just as he had left it. There on the floor was still Ben Price's collar-button that had been torn from that eminent detective's shirt-band when they had overpowered Jimmy to arrest him.\\n\\nPulling out from the wall a folding-bed, Jimmy slid back a panel in the wall and dragged out a dust-covered suit-case. He opened this and gazed fondly at the finest set of burglar's tools in the East. It was a complete set, made of specially tempered steel, the latest designs in drills, punches, braces and bits, jimmies, clamps, and augers, with two or three novelties, invented by Jimmy himself, in which he took pride. Over nine hundred dollars they had cost him to have made at ----, a place where they make such things for the profession.\\n\\nIn half an hour Jimmy went down stairs and through the caf\\u00e9. He was now dressed in tasteful and well-fitting clothes, and carried his dusted and cleaned suit-case in his hand.\\n\\n\\\"Got anything on?\\\" asked Mike Dolan, genially.\\n\\n\\\"Me?\\\" said Jimmy, in a puzzled tone. \\\"I don't understand. I'm representing the New York Amalgamated Short Snap Biscuit Cracker and Frazzled Wheat Company.\\\"\\n\\nThis statement delighted Mike to such an extent that Jimmy had to take a seltzer-and-milk on the spot. He never touched \\\"hard\\\" drinks.\\n\\nA week after the release of Valentine, 9762, there was a neat job of safe-burglary done in Richmond, Indiana, with no clue to the author. A scant eight hundred dollars was all that was secured. Two weeks after that a patented, improved, burglar-proof safe in Logansport was opened like a cheese to the tune of fifteen hundred dollars, currency; securities and silver untouched. That began to interest the rogue-catchers. Then an old-fashioned bank-safe in Jefferson City became active and threw out of its crater an eruption of bank-notes amounting to five thousand dollars. The losses were now high enough to bring the matter up into Ben Price's class of work. By comparing notes, a remarkable similarity in the methods of the burglaries was noticed. Ben Price investigated the scenes of the robberies, and was heard to remark:\\n\\n\\\"That's Dandy Jim Valentine's autograph. He's resumed business. Look at that combination knob\\u2014jerked out as easy as pulling up a radish in wet weather. He's got the only clamps that can do it. And look how clean those tumblers were punched out! Jimmy never has to drill but one hole. Yes, I guess I want Mr. Valentine. He'll do his bit next time without any short-time or clemency foolishness.\\\"\\n\\nBen Price knew Jimmy's habits. He had learned them while working up the Springfield case. Long jumps, quick get-aways, no confederates, and a taste for good society\\u2014these ways had helped Mr. Valentine to become noted as a successful dodger of retribution. It was given out that Ben Price had taken up the trail of the elusive cracksman, and other people with burglar-proof safes felt more at ease.\\n\\nOne afternoon Jimmy Valentine and his suit-case climbed out of the mail-hack in Elmore, a little town five miles off the railroad down in the black-jack country of Arkansas. Jimmy, looking like an athletic young senior just home from college, went down the board side-walk toward the hotel.\\n\\nA young lady crossed the street, passed him at the corner and entered a door over which was the sign, \\\"The Elmore Bank.\\\" Jimmy Valentine looked into her eyes, forgot what he was, and became another man. She lowered her eyes and coloured slightly. Young men of Jimmy's style and looks were scarce in Elmore.\\n\\nJimmy collared a boy that was loafing on the steps of the bank as if he were one of the stockholders, and began to ask him questions about the town, feeding him dimes at intervals. By and by the young lady came out, looking royally unconscious of the young man with the suit-case, and went her way.\\n\\n\\\"Isn't that young lady Polly Simpson?\\\" asked Jimmy, with specious guile.\\n\\n\\\"Naw,\\\" said the boy. \\\"She's Annabel Adams. Her pa owns this bank. What'd you come to Elmore for? Is that a gold watch-chain? I'm going to get a bulldog. Got any more dimes?\\\"\\n\\nJimmy went to the Planters' Hotel, registered as Ralph D. Spencer, and engaged a room. He leaned on the desk and declared his platform to the clerk. He said he had come to Elmore to look for a location to go into business. How was the shoe business, now, in the town? He had thought of the shoe business. Was there an opening?\\n\\nThe clerk was impressed by the clothes and manner of Jimmy. He, himself, was something of a pattern of fashion to the thinly gilded youth of Elmore, but he now perceived his shortcomings. While trying to figure out Jimmy's manner of tying his four-in-hand he cordially gave information.\\n\\nYes, there ought to be a good opening in the shoe line. There wasn't an exclusive shoe-store in the place. The dry-goods and general stores handled them. Business in all lines was fairly good. Hoped Mr. Spencer would decide to locate in Elmore. He would find it a pleasant town to live in, and the people very sociable.\\n\\nMr. Spencer thought he would stop over in the town a few days and look over the situation. No, the clerk needn't call the boy. He would carry up his suit-case, himself; it was rather heavy.\\n\\nMr. Ralph Spencer, the ph\\u0153nix that arose from Jimmy Valentine's ashes\\u2014ashes left by the flame of a sudden and alterative attack of love\\u2014remained in Elmore, and prospered. He opened a shoe-store and secured a good run of trade.\\n\\nSocially he was also a success, and made many friends. And he accomplished the wish of his heart. He met Miss Annabel Adams, and became more and more captivated by her charms.\\n\\nAt the end of a year the situation of Mr. Ralph Spencer was this: he had won the respect of the community, his shoe-store was flourishing, and he and Annabel were engaged to be married in two weeks. Mr. Adams, the typical, plodding, country banker, approved of Spencer. Annabel's pride in him almost equalled her affection. He was as much at home in the family of Mr. Adams and that of Annabel's married sister as if he were already a member.\\n\\nOne day Jimmy sat down in his room and wrote this letter, which he mailed to the safe address of one of his old friends in St. Louis:\\n \\n\\n        Dear Old Pal:\\n\\n        I want you to be at Sullivan's place, in Little Rock, next Wednesday night, at nine o'clock. I want you to wind up some little matters for me. And, also, I want to make you a present of my kit of tools. I know you'll be glad to get them\\u2014you couldn't duplicate the lot for a thousand dollars. Say, Billy, I've quit the old business\\u2014a year ago. I've got a nice store. I'm making an honest living, and I'm going to marry the finest girl on earth two weeks from now. It's the only life, Billy\\u2014the straight one. I wouldn't touch a dollar of another man's money now for a million. After I get married I'm going to sell out and go West, where there won't be so much danger of having old scores brought up against me. I tell you, Billy, she's an angel. She believes in me; and I wouldn't do another crooked thing for the whole world. Be sure to be at Sully's, for I must see you. I'll bring along the tools with me.\\n\\n        Your old friend,\\n\\n        Jimmy.\\n         \\n\\nOn the Monday night after Jimmy wrote this letter, Ben Price jogged unobtrusively into Elmore in a livery buggy. He lounged about town in his quiet way until he found out what he wanted to know. From the drug-store across the street from Spencer's shoe-store he got a good look at Ralph D. Spencer.\\n\\n\\\"Going to marry the banker's daughter are you, Jimmy?\\\" said Ben to himself, softly. \\\"Well, I don't know!\\\"\\n\\nThe next morning Jimmy took breakfast at the Adamses. He was going to Little Rock that day to order his wedding-suit and buy something nice for Annabel. That would be the first time he had left town since he came to Elmore. It had been more than a year now since those last professional \\\"jobs,\\\" and he thought he could safely venture out.\\n\\nAfter breakfast quite a family party went downtown together\\u2014Mr. Adams, Annabel, Jimmy, and Annabel's married sister with her two little girls, aged five and nine. They came by the hotel where Jimmy still boarded, and he ran up to his room and brought along his suit-case. Then they went on to the bank. There stood Jimmy's horse and buggy and Dolph Gibson, who was going to drive him over to the railroad station.\\n\\nAll went inside the high, carved oak railings into the banking-room\\u2014Jimmy included, for Mr. Adams's future son-in-law was welcome anywhere. The clerks were pleased to be greeted by the good-looking, agreeable young man who was going to marry Miss Annabel. Jimmy set his suit-case down. Annabel, whose heart was bubbling with happiness and lively youth, put on Jimmy's hat, and picked up the suit-case. \\\"Wouldn't I make a nice drummer?\\\" said Annabel. \\\"My! Ralph, how heavy it is? Feels like it was full of gold bricks.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lot of nickel-plated shoe-horns in there,\\\" said Jimmy, coolly, \\\"that I'm going to return. Thought I'd save express charges by taking them up. I'm getting awfully economical.\\\"\\n\\nThe Elmore Bank had just put in a new safe and vault. Mr. Adams was very proud of it, and insisted on an inspection by every one. The vault was a small one, but it had a new, patented door. It fastened with three solid steel bolts thrown simultaneously with a single handle, and had a time-lock. Mr. Adams beamingly explained its workings to Mr. Spencer, who showed a courteous but not too intelligent interest. The two children, May and Agatha, were delighted by the shining metal and funny clock and knobs.\\n\\nWhile they were thus engaged Ben Price sauntered in and leaned on his elbow, looking casually inside between the railings. He told the teller that he didn't want anything; he was just waiting for a man he knew.\\n\\nSuddenly there was a scream or two from the women, and a commotion. Unperceived by the elders, May, the nine-year-old girl, in a spirit of play, had shut Agatha in the vault. She had then shot the bolts and turned the knob of the combination as she had seen Mr. Adams do.\\n\\nThe old banker sprang to the handle and tugged at it for a moment. \\\"The door can't be opened,\\\" he groaned. \\\"The clock hasn't been wound nor the combination set.\\\"\\n\\nAgatha's mother screamed again, hysterically.\\n\\n\\\"Hush!\\\" said Mr. Adams, raising his trembling hand. \\\"All be quite for a moment. Agatha!\\\" he called as loudly as he could. \\\"Listen to me.\\\" During the following silence they could just hear the faint sound of the child wildly shrieking in the dark vault in a panic of terror.\\n\\n\\\"My precious darling!\\\" wailed the mother. \\\"She will die of fright! Open the door! Oh, break it open! Can't you men do something?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There isn't a man nearer than Little Rock who can open that door,\\\" said Mr. Adams, in a shaky voice. \\\"My God! Spencer, what shall we do? That child\\u2014she can't stand it long in there. There isn't enough air, and, besides, she'll go into convulsions from fright.\\\"\\n\\nAgatha's mother, frantic now, beat the door of the vault with her hands. Somebody wildly suggested dynamite. Annabel turned to Jimmy, her large eyes full of anguish, but not yet despairing. To a woman nothing seems quite impossible to the powers of the man she worships.\\n\\n\\\"Can't you do something, Ralph \\u2014 try, won't you?\\\"\\n\\nHe looked at her with a queer, soft smile on his lips and in his keen eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Annabel,\\\" he said, \\\"give me that rose you are wearing, will you?\\\"\\n\\nHardly believing that she heard him aright, she unpinned the bud from the bosom of her dress, and placed it in his hand. Jimmy stuffed it into his vest-pocket, threw off his coat and pulled up his shirt-sleeves. With that act Ralph D. Spencer passed away and Jimmy Valentine took his place.\\n\\n\\\"Get away from the door, all of you,\\\" he commanded, shortly.\\n\\nHe set his suit-case on the table, and opened it out flat. From that time on he seemed to be unconscious of the presence of any one else. He laid out the shining, queer implements swiftly and orderly, whistling softly to himself as he always did when at work. In a deep silence and immovable, the others watched him as if under a spell.\\n\\nIn a minute Jimmy's pet drill was biting smoothly into the steel door. In ten minutes\\u2014breaking his own burglarious record\\u2014he threw back the bolts and opened the door.\\n\\nAgatha, almost collapsed, but safe, was gathered into her mother's arms.\\n\\nJimmy Valentine put on his coat, and walked outside the railings towards the front door. As he went he thought he heard a far-away voice that he once knew call \\\"Ralph!\\\" But he never hesitated.\\n\\nAt the door a big man stood somewhat in his way.\\n\\n\\\"Hello, Ben!\\\" said Jimmy, still with his strange smile. \\\"Got around at last, have you? Well, let's go. I don't know that it makes much difference, now.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then Ben Price acted rather strangely.\\n\\n\\\"Guess you're mistaken, Mr. Spencer,\\\" he said. \\\"Don't believe I recognize you. Your buggy's waiting for you, ain't it?\\\"\\n\\nAnd Ben Price turned and strolled down the street.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In this story, a man named Jimmy Valentine is released from prison on a pardon from the governor after serving nearly ten months of a four-year sentence.

She pointed to the mortgage officers\\u2019 desks, which ringed the lobby.\\n\\nHe pulled back the leather chair behind one of the desks and sat. It felt funny to be behind a desk, dressed as he was in black fatigues. The bank robber couldn\\u2019t remember the last time he\\u2019d sat behind any desk, and he\\u2019d certainly never been near one this nice. He stared at the empty page. Writing had never interested him in school; though he knew he had something to say, it gave him an uneasy feeling. He put his gun in the outgoing-mail tray and dumped a box of paper clips onto the desk.\\n\\nThe woman noticed him stringing paper clips together. \\u201cYou could start with, \\u2018Fuck you, pigs, dumb motherfuckers,\\u2019 \\u201d she said. \\u201cOr, if you want it to be more personal, you could try, like, \\u2018I\\u2019m the motherfucking heist king and you know it.\\u2019 It depends on the tone you want.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMotherfucking heist king,\\u201d he repeated, writing it down.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re welcome.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d he said, a little annoyed. \\u201cThank you.\\u201d\\n\\nHe printed \\u201cMotherfucking Heist King\\u201d at the top of the page, then wrote it again and again, trying out different handwriting styles and lining the paper with a chain-link pattern. \\u201cMotherfucking Heist King\\u201d\\u2014it really was a nice phrase. Maybe if he could make a design with it, they would get the point of what he was trying to say. What was he trying to say, anyway? He realized that he hadn\\u2019t actually considered writing a letter until it was suggested to him.\\n\\nAfter a while, the teller came out from behind the counter to get his other bag. She looked over his shoulder at the page, which by then was covered in designs of his own creation. \\u201cWant me to write it?\\u201d she asked.\\n\\nHe handed her the paper and stood, surprised to find himself so irritated at someone who seemed only to want to help him. Walking to one of the high windows, he saw that a few police cars had begun to gather. \\u201cMaybe I should go,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nShe went back behind the counter with a pointed sigh and started to fill the second bag. He watched her poking around the cabinets. Outside, the police were setting up a barricade.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m going as fast as I can,\\u201d the teller said. She sounded angry. \\u201cI have to write your stupid letter and pack up this cash and get everything organized. I\\u2019m only one person.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI didn\\u2019t say anything.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThis obviously isn\\u2019t about me,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve seen this a million times before.

Am I wrong?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re the bitch who volunteered.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWow,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI guess I must have said something to deserve that.\\u201d\\n\\nShe sounded exactly like his mother, which the bank robber realized was just typical.\\n\\n\\u201cMaybe you should go and get in the vault now,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve helped me out. I appreciate you. I can take it from here.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, right,\\u201d she said. \\u201cYou think I\\u2019d let you finish this alone? I\\u2019ve done too much for you already to just walk away. I\\u2019m in it for the long haul.\\u201d She threw the last stacks of cash into the duffel so hard that it slid off the counter, sending its contents spilling across the floor.\\n\\nHe turned back to the window. If he just stayed out of her way, it would be over soon enough.\\n\\nGrumbling, she crouched down to clean it all up. At the very least, she figured, he could have helped when the bag fell. Thinking of others clearly wasn\\u2019t in his nature.

However, his lack of knowledge becomes apparent when he asks if she is sneaking a dye pack into the stolen money. He soon feels remorse for the question and tries to make amends by writing a taunting letter to the police at one of the mortgage officers' desks. The bank teller gives him tips on what to write, to which he begrudgingly says thank you.\\n\\nAs the bank teller works on filling the second duffel bag with money, she begins showing signs of frustration. She accuses the bank robber of only thinking about himself and not considering her efforts to assist him.

He feels like a marked man. The Boss is known for his ruthlessness. When he orders a killing, someone dies. The gunman would like there to be witnesses for what happens next, but the alley\\u2019s deserted.\\n\\nHe glances at his watch, a gift from the Boss. Face a gold coin, no numbers. A joke, probably: time is money. Or, maybe, money is time; it depends on what you\\u2019re short of. The Boss is a great joker. The watch hands are hair-thin, like the edge of a razor blade, hard to see, especially in this fading light. There and not there, like time itself. Which is perhaps not being clocked\\u2014perhaps that\\u2019s what the numberless face is saying. How can you measure the shit you\\u2019re buried in? He doesn\\u2019t know what keeps the watch running. Battery inside, maybe. When the battery dies? Don\\u2019t think about it.\\n\\nOn one assignment or another, the gunman has wasted a few suckers in alleys like this, but not many. His specialty is knocking them off in train stations and hotel lobbies or on the street in broad daylight. There\\u2019s a greater risk of getting nabbed, so always an extra thrill. Which is why he took up doing the Boss\\u2019s dirty work. Thrills remind him that he\\u2019s alive, when not much else does.\\n\\nOverhead, a street lamp comes on, its yellow light a mere stain under the dimming sky. Then a woman passes. It\\u2019s about time, the gunman thinks. Has she been sent by the Boss? Is she his witness? His victim? His executioner? His hand is inside his jacket, resting on the butt of the revolver holstered under his armpit. Probably just an innocent working girl, looking for a pickup, wandering into a place where she doesn\\u2019t belong. Which wouldn\\u2019t stop the Boss from targeting her. Or using her.\\n\\nYou looking for someone, sister? he asks, lurking in the shadows, his cigarette bobbing as he speaks.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t know, she says. She casts an inquisitive gaze at him, then quickly looks away. A signal? He should perhaps throw himself behind the trash cans, but her tender scrutiny has fixed him where he stands.\\n\\nShe walks slowly away into the shadows at the far end of the alley, then swivels and walks back again toward the light. She appears frightened, lost. Touchingly vulnerable. Above her, the street lamp sways rhythmically, causing shadows to stretch and recede, stretch and recede, like a slowly beating heart. She pauses under it and looks around, clearly thinking about something. She\\u2019s no beauty, but she has sweet ways. His hard heart softens. He takes his hand off the revolver.\\n\\nWhen she turns to walk down the alley again, the gunman flicks his cigarette away and walks with her, moving as she moves. Left, right, left . . . it\\u2019s a kind of dance. She asks if he\\u2019s making fun of her. He says he doesn\\u2019t know how to make fun. In truth, he feels caught up in something fundamental. Benumbing. A feeling he hasn\\u2019t had before. Abstract, yet oddly erotic.\\n\\nIt won\\u2019t do any good, she says, reading him.\\n\\nYeah, I know, lady. But I like it.\\n\\nThey reach the dark end of the alley, still moving together, and turn back toward the swaying street lamp. The alley seems almost to fade away, the lamp\\u2019s glow to brighten. There are bats twittering somewhere. Time itself seems to stop, even though he knows it\\u2019s still grinding inexorably toward something messy. The Boss has plans that haven\\u2019t happened yet. Never mind. Worry about them when they do.\\n\\nWhen their dance ends, night has fully descended, sharpening the contrast between the pool of lamplight they have stepped into and the rest of the world, lost in the darkness beyond. That was great, he says. She looks up at him, her face pale but radiant in the light. She nods. Her sad smile seems to say, Yes, but it\\u2019s not enough, is it? She stares down at her feet, and when she does so, her face is masked in shadow. Is she about to betray him? he wonders. Does he care?\\n\\nShe starts suddenly, glances back down the alley. He follows her gaze. Uh-oh. Something is moving. His hand, too slowly, is inside his jacket. Watch out! she cries, and throws herself in front of him. A shot rings out. She collapses into his arms. Holding her, he fires impotently into the darkness. His bullets ricochet through the alley like ironic laughter. Hang on, baby! he pleads, but it\\u2019s too late.\\n\\nIt must be . . . why . . . she whispers, and dies in his arms.\\n\\nHis heart hardens again. Rage bites at the corners of his eyes.

He is prepared to defend himself with his revolver. However, the woman seems lost and vulnerable. The gunman is inexplicably drawn to her, and they begin to walk together, creating a sense of connection and something more profound. The alley seems to fade away as they move, and time seemingly stops.\\n\\nEventually, they reach the end of the alley, and their dance comes to an end.

In his rage and confusion, the gunman is left with unanswered questions and a hardened heart.\\n\\nThe story explores the themes of loneliness, redemption, and the complexity of human connections. The gunman, a hardened killer, briefly experiences a tender connection with the woman, only for it to end tragically.

He\\u2019d always had this notion about hair\\u2014that it was sentient, that it somehow possessed the propensity to tell whether it was appreciated or not\\u2014as far back as he could remember. It was just a dumb notion. One of Tommy\\u2019s uncles had been a nemesis of his when he was a kid. The uncle, pale and pimpled, as sinisterly skinny as an adolescent, even in his forties, had been bald, and Tommy had always wanted to impute that baldness to some inherent deficiency of character.\\n\\n\\u201cIn any case, I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s the way it works,\\u201d said Ernie.\\n\\n\\u201cI understand that\\u2019s not the way it works,\\u201d said Tommy.\\n\\nThe pump\\u2019s nozzle in hand, the bald man was staring into the distance with the unprepossessing vacancy of someone urinating at a trough, his pink tie snagged up over his shoulder and flapping in the breeze like the tongue of a trotting dog. He was actually young, around Tommy, Ernie, and Luke\\u2019s age\\u2014late twenties\\u2014but there was a weathered quality to the skin covering his skull, patches of paler and darker pigment, that made Tommy wonder if the man had recently had chemo.\\n\\nIt was 5 P.M. on a Friday. The three were due to start the evening weekend shift at the Oasis water-cooler factory in an hour. Ernie and Tommy were machine operators. Luke was on the assembly line, sticking the warning stickers on the interior frames of the coolers as they rolled by him at a rate of one every three seconds. Luke was a qualified electrician, but had shown up to work insufficiently sober one too many times, botched the wiring in one house too many\\u2014and then had to take whatever he could get. Most people stuck the gruelling monotony of the assembly line for only a few months: they either got promoted elsewhere or quit. Luke had been on the line for eighteen months straight. As far as Tommy was concerned, it had turned the lad insane. Tommy and Ernie\\u2019s job was also boring, but in a more involved way. Every few weeks, there was some adjustment or recalibration to the cutting equipment that needed to be implemented, plus they were in charge of a team of four lifters\\u2014teen-agers, mostly, who pulled the still-hot casings out of the molds. When things threatened to get too much, they would send the youngsters on errands for glass hammers, rungless ladders, sky hooks.\\n\\nThe bald man went into the petrol station, came back out licking an ice-cream cone, and got into his motor.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s actually a tasty car,\\u201d Ernie pointed out.\\n\\n\\u201cRental,\\u201d said Luke.\\n\\n\\u201cHow do you know?\\u201d asked Tommy.\\n\\n\\u201cYou know,\\u201d said Luke.\\n\\nOn their first break, at 8 P.M. that night, smoking outside the warehouse entrance, Tommy and Ernie spotted the bald man exiting the front offices, his white shirt and pale head giving him a lunar aspect as he crossed the factory lot. There was a weird atmosphere in the plant that weekend, rumors spreading on the floor with a sour excitability, conjecture traded and revised at every canteen break. By Monday morning, the employees had put the pieces of a picture together. The consensus was that the bald man was an American, an emissary from the central office over in Massachusetts or Minnesota, Milwaukee or Manitoba, or wherever the hell the central office was, and that he was here to inform them the factory was going to go. On Monday afternoon, management sent out an e-mail advising of an exciting, company-wide root and branch realignment of resources, which would allow for a dramatic expansion in the company\\u2019s productivity and scale but that, also, somehow, involved cutting the human staff in the Irish plant by sixty per cent.\\n\\n\\u201cActually, the factory is fine. It\\u2019s the employees that are fucked,\\u201d Ernie glossed bitterly, the three sitting in Staunton\\u2019s pub the following Monday night.\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re being automated,\\u201d said Tommy.\\n\\n\\u201cI can\\u2019t believe we are being automated,\\u201d said Luke, delighted at an impending return to unemployment, so long as it wasn\\u2019t his fault.\\n\\n\\u201cThe fatuous head on him, coming out of the petrol station,\\u201d said Ernie. \\u201cEating an ice-cream cone, the contented little motherfucker.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSomeone had to do it,\\u201d said Tommy.\\n\\n\\u201cI wish you hadn\\u2019t pointed him out, though,\\u201d said Ernie.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat did I do?\\u201d said Tommy.\\n\\n\\u201cYou had to point him out like that.

The movement of the players seemed weightless, somehow insubstantial, without the anchoring noise of the crowd and the commentary.\\n\\n\\u201cMaybe give the Premier League another shot,\\u201d said Tommy. He\\u2019d gone to England when he was twelve, trialled at Everton, signed on for their academy, blown the knee out at fifteen, spent a year in physio, spent two years after that doggedly trialling: at Bury, at Rochdale, at Lincoln, at Hamilton fucking Academical, then was clinically depressed from eighteen to twenty-two, then got the Oasis job.\\n\\n\\u201cSure look,\\u201d said Ernie in that way the Irish had, the rising cadence suggesting a phrase that preceded a consolation.\\n\\nLuke looked at Ernie.

A guy who was a bartender there in the winter, but idled in the summer, caught me and blackmailed me, asking for money not to tell my parents. I told him to fuck off. He told my parents. They punished me, but that blueberry juice was the sweetest of potions. The hotel\\u2019s cleaning staff was a woman of undetermined body shape and age, named Baja, who spent summer days sitting on the hotel balcony, looking at nothing, always wearing a blue overcoat and a black scarf on her head, one of its corners covering her jaw to keep it warm. She was, like a ghost, impervious to pain. She had an eternal toothache that she would not treat, the abscess swelling until it had devoured and destroyed one of her eyes. Nobody ever saw her clean anything, though a friend of mine who\\u2019d stayed at the hotel told me that Baja had once walked into his room without knocking, looked around, and said, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you clean this up?

From the top, we could see the weekend-house cluster below and hear the buzzing of circular saws, the banging of hammers, the din of aspiration, for the weekenders were perpetually getting ready for some future in which active life would be successfully completed and there\\u2019d be nothing but peace, virginal nature, and retirement. The war would put an end to that ambition, but back then, when we were kids, the future was always on its way, its advance currents flowing through everything we knew or wanted to know. If we looked away from the house cluster, wooded vales and peaks, meadows and roads stretched toward Sarajevo and beyond, onward to the horizon, into which, at the end of the day, the sun would slide like a coin into a slot. We\\u2019d stand at the edge of the boulder, pine tips emerging from the verdant void beneath our feet, and we\\u2019d look, and look, and look: our visual field had no limits, just as our life had no end.

They were the blisters of toil, the stigmata of devotion. We discovered the pleasure of unbridled, unlimited destruction, the endless joy of converting something into nothing. This was new to us back then. Now it isn\\u2019t. Now we know that that was one of the happiest days of our childhood, perhaps of our entire life. And when we went back to the dump, some time later, and found new garbage there, new generations of refuse, we knew that underneath it all were our smithereens, that we could go on forging them for as long as we were alive, that we would always remember the day we first broke the limited whole.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story is set near a mountain cabin in Jahorina, where there is a hotel called \\u0160ator.

It was Olav who mentioned the place to me, at the start of our relationship. He told me that it\\u2019d been the summer cottage of the Norwegian author Knut Terje Aasbakken. Now it served as a writer\\u2019s retreat, and a narrow lane led up to it from the village Olav was from. As a child, he\\u2019d spy on the writers. They seemed so secretive, he said, and dived into me.\\n\\nAfter our relationship began to get complicated, a friend suggested I go away somewhere. So it was that I remembered Aasbakken\\u2019s cabin. The one on a mountainside, in a forest.\\n\\nI applied, got the cabin, and left at the beginning of September. A woman from the general store drove me from the village. She talked about the area as we crept up the mountain in her little Golf. On the way, we passed the community center. She said it was customary for whoever was in the cabin to give a reading in the center. I gazed down on the river in the valley, and then she dropped me off with a key to the woodshed.\\n\\nEvenings, I\\u2019d take a chair out in front of the cabin and try to stay there till I was shaking from the cold. In the mornings, I read, wrote zip. Late in the day I\\u2019d take a walk. And then one day I found myself at a standstill in front of the community-center notice board. \\u201cBUNADS,\\u201d the heading read, and under it was the name of Olav\\u2019s mother. She was called Halldis and taught the locals to sew their own folk costumes.\\n\\nThe days lasted an eternity, and at night the cold moved in. I walked around Aasbakken\\u2019s house and picked paint from the cabinet doors. Out in the forest, the mushrooms poked up, and it was impossible to escape the reading event in the community center. One evening in October, I positioned myself against a large loom-woven tapestry. During the coffee break, a woman with short dark hair and a face like an Inuit\\u2019s came over. She said, \\u201cI think you\\u2019ve met my son. He lives in Copenhagen.\\u201d I must have stared. \\u201cI\\u2019ve got an article he\\u2019s written about you,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nIn that way, I became sort of friends with Olav\\u2019s mother, Halldis. We agreed to go on some walks together. Later we also went out riding on her Fjord horses. She talked about the landscape, the kinds of tracks animals left, and how the winter we were entering would feel. We never spoke of Olav. It was my impression that she was a strong person, but at regular intervals she\\u2019d worry about whether I\\u2019d write about her.\\n\\nOne day in early November, we took the horses into the forest. When we came to a clearing, I said that the vista would make for a good opening scene. She said, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m so afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nI thought of Olav, his face and hers, and that might\\u2019ve been the day she invited me home for coffee. In any case, I remember that we let the horses loose in the pasture and sat in the kitchen. There were pictures of Olav and his wife on the bulletin board, and I\\u2019m sure that I gave Halldis a hug when I left.\\n\\nDespite the awkwardness in our relationship, we kept seeing each other. One day when we were in the kitchen, Olav\\u2019s father came in. He sat down at the table reluctantly, as we probably didn\\u2019t want to be disturbed. Halldis found him a coffee cup, and of course he was disturbing us. I recall him saying that he didn\\u2019t care for well-educated people. He was a carpenter, Olav\\u2019s father. Said that the hand\\u2019s labor was important and pointed to the table. I praised the table, and then I had to go and see his workshop.\\n\\nWe walked out to it, all three, and what I remember most clearly was that he\\u2019d stuck up a photo of a naked woman with a thumbtack. He\\u2019d pinned her up over the door to the room where Halldis worked on her costumes. That meant that Halldis had to walk under the naked woman anytime she went in and did her sewing. You never know about other people\\u2019s relationships, but I thought to myself that it was their marriage Halldis didn\\u2019t want me to write about. It seemed complicated to me, though I think it seemed healthy to her.\\n\\nEvery day she passed beneath the naked woman who hung over the door with her legs slightly spread, and she\\u2019d hung there so long that Halldis no longer noticed her. She was no doubt thinking of her son in Copenhagen. His wife was beautiful and industrious. He interviewed famous authors. And now one of them was living in Aasbakken\\u2019s cabin.\\n\\nThe cabin had no phone, so I ended up getting a letter. I have it still. He was angry, Olav. \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t have thought it of you,\\u201d he wrote.\\n\\nIn that sense, he wasn\\u2019t like his mother. I can recall another time we rode out together. It was a clear fall morning. On the outward part of our route, we rode past a lake. To me, Norwegian lakes feel bottomless, the landscape unknowable. Such uncertainty must leave its mark on the locals, I thought. Later, we went in among the trees, where it smelled of fungus and rot.\\n\\nAs we rode, we talked about how the forest looked lovely in its decay. I told her she resembled an Inuit, and that Olav must have got his features from her. She smiled at that, and there were birds of prey aloft, and moss upon the massive trunks of spruce, and I drank in everything I saw.\\n\\nThen one day, when we were drinking coffee in the kitchen and her husband came in, wanting attention, she actually began to tell a story. She looked at Olav\\u2019s father, asked him, \\u201cDo I dare to tell this?\\u201d and he said, \\u201cYes, just tell it.\\u201d\\n\\nAt first I thought she asked him whether she should tell the story because it was his, or because he decided which stories could be told in their relationship. In any case, she began telling it, though at times she\\u2019d put a hand over her mouth. \\u201cNo, I don\\u2019t know if I dare,\\u201d she said, glancing from her husband down into her cup.\\n\\nThe story concerned her cousin who had been married to a bad man.\\n\\nIt wasn\\u2019t until the man was dead that the cousin discovered just how bad he\\u2019d been. It came out from the estate and certain letters found with it. \\u201cBut you mustn\\u2019t write this story,\\u201d she said. She shouldn\\u2019t be worried, I said. \\u201cYour cousin\\u2019s husband wasn\\u2019t so out of the ordinary.\\u201d She asked, did I know such men? I said that now and then I ran into one. She asked if I wrote about them. \\u201cSometimes,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nI have the impression that during the time we spent together she managed to read my books. She mentioned one in particular. It had become winter, we were in the forest, and the surroundings creaked with snow and ice. She\\u2019d read the book but didn\\u2019t quite know what to think of it. She found the indecisiveness of the female protagonist especially hard to bear.\\n\\nWe crawled over an old stone wall. The sun was shining; my eyes hurt from all the whiteness. Recently, I saw an old photo from the gold-mining town of Yellowknife, near the Arctic Circle. It was a picture of an Inuit and then the sun, and the sun wasn\\u2019t alone. It had company.

Not those floppy, enormous store-bought doughnuts with all that crap inside, but cute, chubby little doughnuts with homemade jam and handcrafted powdered sugar. He works his ass off in the kitchen for like twelve hours. The kiddo looks at the dish of doughnuts and, without touching them, says firmly: \\u201cI don\\u2019t like it,\\u201d then goes off to do her own thing. In his mind, X. says some strongly worded things about girls as a concept, eats two platefuls of chubby little doughnuts, and succumbs to several hours of moral and physical melancholy. The next day, he goes to pick up the kiddo from the Hanukkah party at her day care. He finds her sitting on the floor next to another kiddo. That kiddo is licking damp powdered sugar off some crumbly store-bought doughnuts and handing them off to our kiddo, who consumes each one with great enthusiasm. X. tries to convince himself that the issue was the powdered sugar, but his wounded soul cries out for justice. \\u201cWhy is this happening to me, Mama?\\u201d he asks his mother that evening. \\u201cIt\\u2019s because of the dumplings,\\u201d his mother says.

This saintly woman was always exceptionally attentive to the lives of others and willing to listen to any kind of story: about famine, terror, German occupation, evacuation, thaw, stagnation, perestroika, and so on.

So translator C. starts recommending his system to everyone he knows. Then, one day, he walks into the bathroom, and there\\u2019s his seven-year-old son P., lying in the empty tub with his eyes closed, mumbling: \\u201cWhy should I, an adult human, have to think about any of this?

When the teacher questions her about why she would do this, Katya explains that the disliked child is usually strong, but now she's probably tired herself out.\\n\\nMoving on, the story shifts to X., an engineer and father, who decides to make traditional Hanukkah doughnuts for his two-year-old child from scratch.

The next day, X. discovers his child happily eating store-bought doughnuts at her daycare. He recalls his own childhood experience of refusing to eat his mother's homemade dumplings but happily eating store-bought ones at other households.\\n\\nNext, a little boy tells his mother in the middle of a train station that he no longer wants to be the person she is raising him to be and instead wants to scream in the subway. This showcases the child's desire for self-expression and rebellion.\\n\\nIn another household, a poet named F. has an aged nanny who has been with the family for generations. The nanny has survived various historical events and always asks, \\\"So, did he get away?\\\" after hearing stories. This question leads to a discussion among guests about the significance of this question in relation to the Russian and Jewish people.\\n\\nLater, an anxious writer named G. becomes convinced that he has wronged his loved ones, leading him to call them multiple times a day to apologize for small things. Eventually, his loved ones send him a letter stating that they don't need a reason to hate him. This highlights G.'s paranoia and fear of not being loved.\\n\\nLastly, a translator named C. finds a way to solve his children's problems by refusing to do things for them, claiming that he, as an adult, should not have to pick up after them or do certain things. This strategy leads his children to become more independent and self-sufficient. However, C. begins to feel sick when he finds his son mimicking his words in an empty bathtub, making him question his own parenting approach.\\n\\nOverall, the story explores various aspects of human behavior, including violence, preference, rebellion, generational experiences, fear, and parenting techniques.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"In this collection of interconnected flash fiction stories, the author explores various scenarios and situations that highlight the complexity of human nature and relationships.\\n\\nIn the first story, a teacher engages with children discussing ethics and what they would do if they witness a bullying situation.

Through her silence, the nanny represents the resilience of people living through challenging times.\\n\\nIn the fifth story, a paranoid writer ensures he asks forgiveness for every minor mistake he believes he makes, bombarding loved ones with calls until they send him a letter saying they don't need a reason to hate him. This paints a portrait of someone grappling with anxiety while trying to maintain relationships.\\n\\nThe final story features a translator named C. who ingeniously handles his children by refusing to solve problems for them.

A red-haired woman came up afterward. He had seen her circling earlier, taking a chair at the back, but he had not troubled about it. \\u201cI knew you in the Congo,\\u201d she said now. \\u201cI knew your wife.\\u201d My wife? he thought, but, as always after a reading, in the retreating roar of his own soul he could barely hear her or remember how English worked. Had she said \\u201clife,\\u201d not \\u201cwife\\u201d? Her voice, that of a crow, thrust at him\\u2014some weekend they\\u2019d \\u201call spent together\\u201d and he\\u2019d sent her a letter the next day, a poem. Dread rose at the back of his mind; a parcel broke. He turned away, busied himself. He blamed, abhorred the touch of a past time; it surprised him how much. She followed him to the dinner that Charles (the London Librarian) had arranged at a nearby bistro, hurrying along behind everyone else, and, with the touch of his wife or his life burning like a toxin on his inside skin, Joseph Conrad could not meet her eyes or let pathos come clouding into him. When she seated herself at the foot of the table and was speaking loudly to anyone who listened, he felt the pluck of it on the side of his head but did not turn, he had to continue, now he\\u2019d begun, it was a long dinner. It was unjust. In other contexts, he admired perseverance. She was drowning. He did not turn. The light of pure reason, Joseph Conrad liked to say, resembles electricity in being cold. Proud statements like this came to him now and again when he was swimming but afterward seemed a bit off. No, it was a little nightmare, it was a rescue he could not carry out (and he was a rescuer).\\n\\nBut eventually the dinner ended. It was still 1907. No one had drowned. Shrugging into coats, they said hearty farewell things. He did not catch her eye. All left together to walk back toward the Library and go their ways. It was an early winter night. He began to feel fundamentally impatient with himself, hot with cowardice. He dropped back to walk beside her. His heartbeat was too fast. She did not seem surprised. An unknownness enveloped them, as if they were playing a game, as if they were draped in cloth or lost in old rooms. How they got to talking about white bread he could not remember afterward, but it shone in his mind, this conversation, as the bread had shone, and he was trying to tell her all that. Maybe she had mentioned lining up for bread in the early-morning dusk, sent out by her mother, running home with a loaf as heavy as two schoolbooks. When one dreamed of bread even now, Joseph Conrad agreed with her, it was not the rough black bread of childhood. Dream bread, mythic bread, was as white as a freshly laundered cuff.\\n\\nOnce, he had gone from London to visit his homeland and been invited to a christening in the countryside. It was June. On the drive, the weather closed in, matte gray and vague, typical summer weather for that region. The ceremony was as usual, in a tiny white church, where everyone sat packed like teeth and listened to short, glorious off-key songs sung by a ten-year-old girl, who was the sister of the new baby. The sun came out. Everyone rushed from the church. They stood amid graves, talking, amazed. Vast general fields reached away on every side to the mountains. He recalled the feeling of being a small mark at the center of a greenness so dazzlingly revealed it hurt the eyes. Soon, they embarked in cars and drove to a nearby farmhouse for lunch, sunlight still spilling over everything.\\n\\nThe farmhouse stood with all doors open, children tumbling in and out, busy conversation everywhere. He knew scarcely anyone, so stood in an inner room, mastering it in case he would one day write about it, near a table draped in a lace cloth and heavy with cakes. There was a cake as big as two schoolbooks\\u2014he smilingly used her analogy\\u2014emblazoned with the name of the new baby. A chocolate cake shaped like a bear and full of candies that erupted for the children. Many fluffy cream cakes and several tall block-like structures layered with red jam. There were also other smaller foods, shrimp on crackers and so forth, and, finally, carried in late with a sort of hasty deference, on its own blue-patterned china plate, a stack of sliced white bread. The plate was placed, as it happened, in a shaft of sunlight, and the white bread shone, in its own piety, on the lace in that shadowy room, set into the history of a sunlit afternoon on an ancient property amid fields stretching to the ends of the mind.\\n\\nNo one ate the white bread. It wasn\\u2019t there to be eaten. It was a chapter of civilization. He had lived that chapter and so had she, this red-haired woman, in the poor places and poor childish times when a glowing heap of crispy loaves in a shop window was twice as radiant as the rubies or diamonds on display at the jeweller\\u2019s down the street. The two of them stood in front of the London Library, tossed out of memory, dazed by the sexual nearness of something ultimate. An adoration without hope. She was starting to say something about metaphors, metaphors being also real, which didn\\u2019t interest him.

Hey, I was named after my pet dog!\\u201d\\n\\nSome people laughed. Indy prompted the next question.\\n\\nIt came from a pretty woman in a clingy skirt. \\u201cHi, Dr. Jones,\\u201d she said, and, as she went on, he found himself recalling a student, a girl, from his teaching days. \\u201cYou mentioned that, at the Maharajah\\u2019s banquet, you were served a dessert of chilled monkey brains?\\u201d\\n\\nHe nodded, still thinking of the student who used to sit in the front row of his history class. Once, on her eyelids, she\\u2019d written him a message. \\u201cLove\\u201d on the right lid, and \\u201cYou\\u201d on the left.\\n\\n\\u201cSome say this idea of Asians eating monkey brains is an urban legend, based on a misunderstanding of the Chinese h\\u00f3u t\\u00f3u g\\u016b, which translates to \\u2018monkey-head mushroom.\\u2019 Could it be that you ate monkey-head-mushroom soup? It\\u2019s a Manchurian dish.\\u201d\\n\\nIndy recalled the way his former student had closed and opened her eyes. Love you. Love you. It was sort of disgusting to think of her writing on her own eyelids. But kind of amazing, too. What wouldn\\u2019t she do?\\n\\n\\u201cDr. Jones?\\u201d the questioner said.\\n\\nIndy looked to the moderator, who was also looking at him, illegibly. \\u201cI just ate what I was told to eat,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nSilence. He took a long gulp of water.\\n\\nThe world had grown unfriendly to his form of research. What he wouldn\\u2019t give to be back in the jungles of Honduras or jumping trains across Nazi-occupied Europe, where he could let his whip do the talking. He\\u2019d taken this gig for the honorarium, mainly.\\n\\nFor the final question, the moderator pointed to a tiny woman with billowing black hair. \\u201cMr. Jones,\\u201d she said, already annoying him, for he had a Ph.D. \\u201cHow would you respond to the claim that you\\u2019re more of a grave robber than an archeologist?

Quietly he said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never put anything in a museum.\\u201d\\n\\nHe looked at the floor. The general murmur was excruciating.\\n\\nEventually, he heard the gentle voice of the moderator: \\u201cIndiana . . .

There will always be Nazis.\\u201d\\n\\nHe frowned, suspicious. As he looked out at the audience, he could see waves of nodding faces, confirming the ever-presence of Nazis.

The audience questions him about specific incidents, such as his encounter with a demonic cult in an Indian village and his consumption of chilled monkey brains.

He then reflects on the audience and their diversity, associating it with his friendship with an Egyptian man. The interview progresses, and the first audience member asks for the name of the village in India that sent Indy on a mission. Indy cannot recall the name, and the moderator supplies it. The next audience member questions Indy about a delicacy he was served at the Maharajah's banquet, pointing out that it may have been misinterpreted as monkey brains. This situates Indy's mind on a former student who once relayed a message on her eyelids during his class.\\n\\nThe final inquiry becomes more critical as an audience member accuses him of being more of a grave robber than an archeologist, arguing that looted objects should remain in the places they were stolen from. Indy becomes defensive and asserts that he is the hero who has fought for the innocent people in the world, only to lose the objects he sought. Feeling defeated, he admits he has never truly saved any artifacts and falls into silence until the panel moderator brings him back into focus. The moderator affectionately tries to make Indy see that, although the audience holds mixed feelings about his missions, they find him charming and alluring nonetheless. She questions whether he should focus on fighting Nazis, bringing to light the need for heroes like him in the world even if Nazism itself is ostensibly defunct.

The car was empty. He had nothing planned that day. Wherever he went and whatever he did (or didn\\u2019t do) was entirely up to him. It was ten o\\u2019clock on a windless summer morning, and the sun was beating down. The train passed Shinjuku, Yotsuya, Ochanomizu, and arrived at Tokyo Central Station, the end of the line. Everyone got off, and Tengo followed suit. Then he sat on a bench and gave some thought to where he should go. \\u201cI can go anywhere I decide to,\\u201d he told himself. \\u201cIt looks as if it\\u2019s going to be a hot day. I could go to the seashore.\\u201d He raised his head and studied the platform guide.\\n\\nAt that point, he realized what he had been doing all along.\\n\\nHe tried shaking his head a few times, but the idea that had struck him would not go away. He had probably made up his mind unconsciously the moment he boarded the Chuo Line train in Koenji. He heaved a sigh, stood up from the bench, and asked a station employee for the fastest connection to Chikura. The man flipped through the pages of a thick volume of train schedules. He should take the 11:30 special express train to Tateyama, the man said, and transfer there to a local; he would arrive at Chikura shortly after two o\\u2019clock. Tengo bought a Tokyo-Chikura round-trip ticket. Then he went to a restaurant in the station and ordered rice and curry and a salad.\\n\\nGoing to see his father was a depressing prospect. He had never much liked the man, and his father had no special love for him, either. He had retired four years earlier and, soon afterward, entered a sanatorium in Chikura that specialized in patients with cognitive disorders. Tengo had visited him there no more than twice\\u2014the first time just after he had entered the facility, when a procedural problem required Tengo, as the only relative, to be there. The second visit had also involved an administrative matter. Two times: that was it.\\n\\nThe sanatorium stood on a large plot of land by the coast. It was an odd combination of elegant old wooden buildings and new three-story reinforced-concrete buildings. The air was fresh, however, and, aside from the roar of the surf, it was always quiet. An imposing pine grove formed a windbreak along the edge of the garden. And the medical facilities were excellent. With his health insurance, retirement bonus, savings, and pension, Tengo\\u2019s father could probably spend the rest of his life there quite comfortably. He might not leave behind any sizable inheritance, but at least he would be taken care of, for which Tengo was tremendously grateful. Tengo had no intention of taking anything from him or giving anything to him. They were two separate human beings who had come from\\u2014and were heading toward\\u2014entirely different places. By chance, they had spent some years of life together\\u2014that was all. It was a shame that it had come to that, but there was absolutely nothing that Tengo could do about it.\\n\\nTengo paid his check and went to the platform to wait for the Tateyama train. His only fellow-passengers were happy-looking families heading out for a few days at the beach.\\n\\nMost people think of Sunday as a day of rest. Throughout his childhood, however, Tengo had never once viewed Sunday as a day to enjoy. For him, Sunday was like a misshapen moon that showed only its dark side. When the weekend came, his whole body began to feel sluggish and achy, and his appetite would disappear. He had even prayed for Sunday not to come, though his prayers were never answered.\\n\\nWhen Tengo was a boy, his father was a collector of subscription fees for NHK\\u2014Japan\\u2019s quasi-governmental radio and television network\\u2014and, every Sunday, he would take Tengo with him as he went door to door soliciting payment. Tengo had started going on these rounds before he entered kindergarten and continued through fifth grade without a single weekend off. He had no idea whether other NHK fee collectors worked on Sundays, but, for as long as he could remember, his father always had. If anything, his father worked with even more enthusiasm than usual, because on Sundays he could catch the people who were usually out during the week.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father had several reasons for taking him along on his rounds. One reason was that he could not leave the boy at home alone. On weekdays and Saturdays, Tengo could go to school or to day care, but these institutions were closed on Sundays. Another reason, Tengo\\u2019s father said, was that it was important for a father to show his son what kind of work he did. A child should learn early on what activity was supporting him, and he should appreciate the importance of labor. Tengo\\u2019s father had been sent out to work in the fields on his father\\u2019s farm, on Sunday like any other day, from the time he was old enough to understand anything. He had even been kept out of school during the busiest seasons. To him, such a life was a given.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father\\u2019s third and final reason was a more calculating one, which was why it had left the deepest scars on his son\\u2019s heart. Tengo\\u2019s father was well aware that having a small child with him made his job easier. Even people who were determined not to pay often ended up forking over the money when a little boy was staring up at them, which was why Tengo\\u2019s father saved his most difficult routes for Sunday. Tengo sensed from the beginning that this was the role he was expected to play, and he absolutely hated it. But he also felt that he had to perform it as cleverly as he could in order to please his father. If he pleased his father, he would be treated kindly that day. He might as well have been a trained monkey.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s one consolation was that his father\\u2019s beat was fairly far from home. They lived in a suburban residential district outside the city of Ichikawa, and his father\\u2019s rounds were in the center of the city. At least he was able to avoid doing collections at the homes of his classmates. Occasionally, though, while walking in the downtown shopping area, he would spot a classmate on the street. When this happened, he ducked behind his father to keep from being noticed.\\n\\nOn Monday mornings, his school friends would talk excitedly about where they had gone and what they had done the day before. They went to amusement parks and zoos and baseball games. In the summer, they went swimming, in the winter skiing. But Tengo had nothing to talk about. From morning to evening on Sundays, he and his father rang the doorbells of strangers\\u2019 houses, bowed their heads, and took money from whoever came to the door. If people didn\\u2019t want to pay, his father would threaten or cajole them. If they tried to talk their way out of paying, his father would raise his voice. Sometimes he would curse at them like stray dogs. Such experiences were not the sort of thing that Tengo could share with friends. He could not help feeling like a kind of alien in the society of middle-class children of white-collar workers. He lived a different kind of life in a different world. Luckily, his grades were outstanding, as was his athletic ability. So even though he was an alien he was never an outcast. In most circumstances, he was treated with respect. But whenever the other boys invited him to go somewhere or to visit their homes on a Sunday he had to turn them down. Soon, they stopped asking.\\n\\nBorn the third son of a farming family in the hardscrabble Tohoku region, Tengo\\u2019s father had left home as soon as he could, joining a homesteaders\\u2019 group and crossing over to Manchuria in the nineteen-thirties. He had not believed the government\\u2019s claims that Manchuria was a paradise where the land was vast and rich. He knew enough to realize that \\u201cparadise\\u201d was not to be found anywhere. He was simply poor and hungry. The best he could hope for if he stayed at home was a life on the brink of starvation. In Manchuria, he and the other homesteaders were given some farming implements and small arms, and together they started cultivating the land. The soil was poor and rocky, and in winter everything froze. Sometimes stray dogs were all they had to eat. Even so, with government support for the first few years they managed to get by. Their lives were finally becoming more stable when, in August, 1945, the Soviet Union launched a full-scale invasion of Manchuria. Tengo\\u2019s father had been expecting this to happen, having been secretly informed of the impending situation by a certain official, a man he had become friendly with. The minute he heard the news that the Soviets had violated the border, he mounted his horse, galloped to the local train station, and boarded the second-to-last train for Da-lien. He was the only one among his farming companions to make it back to Japan before the end of the year.\\n\\nAfter the war, Tengo\\u2019s father went to Tokyo and tried to make a living as a black marketeer and as a carpenter\\u2019s apprentice, but he could barely keep himself alive. He was working as a liquor-store deliveryman in Asakusa when he bumped into his old friend the official he had known in Manchuria. When the man learned that Tengo\\u2019s father was having a hard time finding a decent job, he offered to recommend him to a friend in the subscription department of NHK, and Tengo\\u2019s father gladly accepted. He knew almost nothing about NHK, but he was willing to try anything that promised a steady income.\\n\\nAt NHK, Tengo\\u2019s father carried out his duties with great gusto. His foremost strength was his perseverance in the face of adversity. To someone who had barely eaten a filling meal since birth, collecting NHK fees was not excruciating work. The most hostile curses hurled at him were nothing. Moreover, he felt satisfaction at belonging to an important organization, even as one of its lowest-ranking members. His performance and attitude were so outstanding that, after a year as a commissioned collector, he was taken directly into the ranks of the full-fledged employees, an almost unheard-of achievement at NHK. Soon, he was able to move into a corporation-owned apartment and join the company\\u2019s health-care plan. It was the greatest stroke of good fortune he had ever had in his life.\\n\\nYoung Tengo\\u2019s father never sang him lullabies, never read books to him at bedtime. Instead, he told the boy stories of his actual experiences. He was a good storyteller. His accounts of his childhood and youth were not exactly pregnant with meaning, but the details were lively. There were funny stories, moving stories, and violent stories. If a life can be measured by the color and variety of its episodes, Tengo\\u2019s father\\u2019s life had been rich in its own way, perhaps. But when his stories touched on the period after he became an NHK employee they suddenly lost all vitality. He had met a woman, married her, and had a child\\u2014Tengo. A few months after Tengo was born, his mother had fallen ill and died. His father had raised him alone after that, while working hard for NHK. The End. How he happened to meet Tengo\\u2019s mother and marry her, what kind of woman she was, what had caused her death, whether her death had been an easy one or she had suffered greatly\\u2014Tengo\\u2019s father told him almost nothing about such matters. If he tried asking, his father just evaded the questions. Most of the time, such questions put him in a foul mood. Not a single photograph of Tengo\\u2019s mother had survived.\\n\\nTengo fundamentally disbelieved his father\\u2019s story. He knew that his mother hadn\\u2019t died a few months after he was born. In his only memory of her, he was a year and a half old and she was standing by his crib in the arms of a man other than his father. His mother took off her blouse, dropped the straps of her slip, and let the man who was not his father suck on her breasts. Tengo slept beside them, his breathing audible. But, at the same time, he was not asleep. He was watching his mother.\\n\\nThis was Tengo\\u2019s photograph of his mother. The ten-second scene was burned into his brain with perfect clarity. It was the only concrete information he had about her, the one tenuous connection his mind could make with her. He and she were linked by this hypothetical umbilical cord. His father, however, had no idea that this vivid scene existed in Tengo\\u2019s memory, or that, like a cow in a meadow, Tengo was endlessly regurgitating fragments of it to chew on, a cud from which he obtained essential nutrients. Father and son: each was locked in a deep, dark embrace with his own secrets.\\n\\nAs an adult, Tengo often wondered if the young man sucking on his mother\\u2019s breasts in his vision was his biological father. This was because Tengo in no way resembled his father, the stellar NHK collections agent. Tengo was a tall, strapping man with a broad forehead, a narrow nose, and tightly balled ears. His father was short and squat and utterly unimpressive. He had a small forehead, a flat nose, and pointed ears like a horse\\u2019s. Where Tengo had a relaxed and generous look, his father appeared nervous and tightfisted. Comparing the two of them, people often openly remarked on their dissimilarity.\\n\\nStill, it was not their physical features that made it difficult for Tengo to identify with his father but their psychological makeup. His father showed no sign at all of what might be called intellectual curiosity. True, having been born in poverty he had not had a decent education. Tengo felt a degree of pity for his father\\u2019s circumstances. But a basic desire to obtain knowledge\\u2014which Tengo assumed to be a more or less natural urge in people\\u2014was lacking in the man. He had a certain practical wisdom that enabled him to survive, but Tengo could discern no hint of a willingness in his father to deepen himself, to view a wider, larger world. Tengo\\u2019s father never seemed to suffer discomfort from the stagnant air of his cramped little life. Tengo never once saw him pick up a book. He had no interest in music or movies, and he never took a trip. The only thing that seemed to interest him was his collection route. He would make a map of the area, mark it with colored pens, and examine it whenever he had a spare moment, the way a biologist might study chromosomes.\\n\\nTengo, by contrast, was curious about everything. He absorbed knowledge from a broad range of fields with the efficiency of a power shovel scooping earth. He had been regarded as a math prodigy from early childhood, and he could solve high-school math problems by the time he was in third grade. Math was, for young Tengo, an effective means of retreat from his life with his father. In the mathematical world, he would walk down a long corridor, opening one numbered door after another. Each time a new spectacle unfolded before him, the ugly traces of the real world would simply disappear. As long as he was actively exploring that realm of infinite consistency, he was free.\\n\\nWhile math was like a magnificent imaginary building for Tengo, literature was a vast magical forest. Math stretched infinitely upward toward the heavens, but stories spread out before him, their sturdy roots stretching deep into the earth. In this forest there were no maps, no doorways. As Tengo got older, the forest of story began to exert an even stronger pull on his heart than the world of math. Of course, reading novels was just another form of escape\\u2014as soon as he closed the book, he had to come back to the real world. But at some point he noticed that returning to reality from the world of a novel was not as devastating a blow as returning from the world of math. Why was that? After much thought, he reached a conclusion. No matter how clear things might become in the forest of story, there was never a clear-cut solution, as there was in math. The role of a story was, in the broadest terms, to transpose a problem into another form. Depending on the nature and the direction of the problem, a solution might be suggested in the narrative. Tengo would return to the real world with that suggestion in hand. It was like a piece of paper bearing the indecipherable text of a magic spell. It served no immediate practical purpose, but it contained a possibility.\\n\\nThe one possible solution that Tengo was able to decipher from his readings was this one: My real father must be somewhere else. Like an unfortunate child in a Dickens novel, Tengo had perhaps been led by strange circumstances to be raised by this impostor. Such a possibility was both a nightmare and a great hope. After reading \\u201cOliver Twist,\\u201d Tengo plowed through every Dickens volume in the library. As he travelled through Dickens\\u2019s stories, he steeped himself in reimagined versions of his own life. These fantasies grew ever longer and more complex. They followed a single pattern, but with infinite variations. In all of them, Tengo would tell himself that his father\\u2019s home was not where he belonged. He had been mistakenly locked in this cage, and someday his real parents would find him and rescue him. Then he would have the most beautiful, peaceful, and free Sundays imaginable.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father prided himself on his son\\u2019s excellent grades, and boasted of them to people in the neighborhood. At the same time, however, he showed a certain displeasure with Tengo\\u2019s brightness and talent. Often when Tengo was at his desk, studying, his father would interrupt him, ordering the boy to do chores or nagging him about his supposedly offensive behavior. The content of his father\\u2019s nagging was always the same: here he was, running himself ragged every day, covering huge distances and enduring people\\u2019s curses, while Tengo did nothing but take it easy all the time, living in comfort. \\u201cThey had me working my tail off when I was your age, and my father and older brothers would beat me black and blue for anything at all. They never gave me enough food. They treated me like an animal. I don\\u2019t want you thinking you\\u2019re so special just because you got a few good grades.\\u201d\\n\\nThis man is envious of me, Tengo began to think at a certain point. He\\u2019s jealous, either of me as a person or of the life I\\u2019m leading. But would a father really feel jealousy toward his son? Tengo did not judge his father, but he could not help sensing a pathetic kind of meanness emanating from his words and deeds. It was not that Tengo\\u2019s father hated him as a person but, rather, that he hated something inside Tengo, something that he could not forgive.\\n\\nWhen the train left Tokyo Station, Tengo took out the paperback that he had brought along. It was an anthology of short stories on the theme of travel and it included a tale called \\u201cTown of Cats,\\u201d a fantastical piece by a German writer with whom Tengo was not familiar. According to the book\\u2019s foreword, the story had been written in the period between the two World Wars.\\n\\nIn the story, a young man is travelling alone with no particular destination in mind. He rides the train and gets off at any stop that arouses his interest. He takes a room, sees the sights, and stays for as long as he likes. When he has had enough, he boards another train. He spends every vacation this way.\\n\\nOne day, he sees a lovely river from the train window. Gentle green hills line the meandering stream, and below them lies a pretty little town with an old stone bridge. The train stops at the town\\u2019s station, and the young man steps down with his bag. No one else gets off, and, as soon as he alights, the train departs.\\n\\nNo workers man the station, which must see very little activity. The young man crosses the bridge and walks into the town. All the shops are shuttered, the town hall deserted. No one occupies the desk at the town\\u2019s only hotel. The place seems totally uninhabited. Perhaps all the people are off napping somewhere. But it is only ten-thirty in the morning, far too early for that. Perhaps something has caused all the people to abandon the town. In any case, the next train will not come until the following morning, so he has no choice but to spend the night here. He wanders around the town to kill time.\\n\\nIn fact, this is a town of cats. When the sun starts to go down, many cats come trooping across the bridge\\u2014cats of all different kinds and colors. They are much larger than ordinary cats, but they are still cats. The young man is shocked by this sight. He rushes into the bell tower in the center of town and climbs to the top to hide. The cats go about their business, raising the shop shutters or seating themselves at their desks to start their day\\u2019s work. Soon, more cats come, crossing the bridge into town like the others. They enter the shops to buy things or go to the town hall to handle administrative matters or eat a meal at the hotel restaurant or drink beer at the tavern and sing lively cat songs. Because cats can see in the dark, they need almost no lights, but that particular night the glow of the full moon floods the town, enabling the young man to see every detail from his perch in the bell tower. When dawn approaches, the cats finish their work, close up the shops, and swarm back across the bridge.\\n\\nBy the time the sun comes up, the cats are gone, and the town is deserted again. The young man climbs down, picks one of the hotel beds for himself, and goes to sleep. When he gets hungry, he eats some bread and fish that have been left in the hotel kitchen. When darkness approaches, he hides in the bell tower again and observes the cats\\u2019 activities until dawn. Trains stop at the station before noon and in the late afternoon. No passengers alight, and no one boards, either. Still, the trains stop at the station for exactly one minute, then pull out again. He could take one of these trains and leave the creepy cat town behind. But he doesn\\u2019t. Being young, he has a lively curiosity and is ready for adventure. He wants to see more of this strange spectacle. If possible, he wants to find out when and how this place became a town of cats.\\n\\nOn his third night, a hubbub breaks out in the square below the bell tower. \\u201cHey, do you smell something human?\\u201d one of the cats says. \\u201cNow that you mention it, I thought there was a funny smell the past few days,\\u201d another chimes in, twitching his nose. \\u201cMe, too,\\u201d yet another cat says. \\u201cThat\\u2019s weird. There shouldn\\u2019t be any humans here,\\u201d someone adds. \\u201cNo, of course not. There\\u2019s no way a human could get into this town of cats.\\u201d \\u201cBut that smell is definitely here.\\u201d\\n\\nThe cats form groups and begin to search the town like bands of vigilantes. It takes them very little time to discover that the bell tower is the source of the smell. The young man hears their soft paws padding up the stairs. That\\u2019s it, they\\u2019ve got me! he thinks. His smell seems to have roused the cats to anger. Humans are not supposed to set foot in this town. The cats have big, sharp claws and white fangs. He has no idea what terrible fate awaits him if he is discovered, but he is sure that they will not let him leave the town alive.\\n\\nThree cats climb to the top of the bell tower and sniff the air. \\u201cStrange,\\u201d one cat says, twitching his whiskers, \\u201cI smell a human, but there\\u2019s no one here.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt is strange,\\u201d a second cat says. \\u201cBut there really isn\\u2019t anyone here. Let\\u2019s go and look somewhere else.\\u201d\\n\\nThe cats cock their heads, puzzled, then retreat down the stairs. The young man hears their footsteps fading into the dark of night. He breathes a sigh of relief, but he doesn\\u2019t understand what just happened. There was no way they could have missed him. But for some reason they didn\\u2019t see him. In any case, he decides that when morning comes he will go to the station and take the train out of this town. His luck can\\u2019t last forever.\\n\\nThe next morning, however, the train does not stop at the station. He watches it pass by without slowing down. The afternoon train does the same. He can see the engineer seated at the controls. But the train shows no sign of stopping. It is as though no one can see the young man waiting for a train\\u2014or even see the station itself. Once the afternoon train disappears down the track, the place grows quieter than ever. The sun begins to sink. It is time for the cats to come. The young man knows that he is irretrievably lost. This is no town of cats, he finally realizes. It is the place where he is meant to be lost. It is another world, which has been prepared especially for him. And never again, for all eternity, will the train stop at this station to take him back to the world he came from.\\n\\nTengo read the story twice. The phrase \\u201cthe place where he is meant to be lost\\u201d attracted his attention. He closed the book and let his eyes wander across the drab industrial scene passing by the train window. Soon afterward, he drifted off to sleep\\u2014not a long nap but a deep one. He woke covered in sweat. The train was moving along the southern coastline of the Boso Peninsula in midsummer.\\n\\nOne morning when he was in fifth grade, after much careful thinking, Tengo declared that he was going to stop making the rounds with his father on Sundays. He told his father that he wanted to use the time for studying and reading books and playing with other kids. He wanted to live a normal life like everybody else.\\n\\nTengo said what he needed to say, concisely and coherently.\\n\\nHis father, of course, blew up. He didn\\u2019t give a damn what other families did, he said. \\u201cWe have our own way of doing things. And don\\u2019t you dare talk to me about a \\u2018normal life,\\u2019 Mr. Know-It-All. What do you know about a \\u2018normal life\\u2019?\\u201d Tengo did not try to argue with him. He merely stared back in silence, knowing that nothing he said would get through to his father. Finally, his father told him that if he wouldn\\u2019t listen then he couldn\\u2019t go on feeding him. Tengo should get the hell out.\\n\\nTengo did as he was told. He had made up his mind. He was not going to be afraid. Now that he had been given permission to leave his cage, he was more relieved than anything else. But there was no way that a ten-year-old boy could live on his own. When his class was dismissed at the end of the day, he confessed his predicament to his teacher. The teacher was a single woman in her mid-thirties, a fair-minded, warmhearted person. She heard Tengo out with sympathy, and that evening she took him back to his father\\u2019s place for a long talk.\\n\\nTengo was told to leave the room, so he was not sure what they said to each other, but finally his father had to sheathe his sword. However extreme his anger might be, he could not leave a ten-year-old boy to wander the streets alone. The duty of a parent to support his child was a matter of law.\\n\\nAs a result of the teacher\\u2019s talk with his father, Tengo was free to spend Sundays as he pleased. This was the first tangible right that he had ever won from his father. He had taken his first step toward freedom and independence.\\n\\nAt the reception desk of the sanatorium, Tengo gave his name and his father\\u2019s name.\\n\\nThe nurse asked, \\u201cHave you by any chance notified us of your intention to visit today?\\u201d There was a hard edge to her voice. A small woman, she wore metal-framed glasses, and her short hair had a touch of gray.\\n\\n\\u201cNo, it just occurred to me to come this morning and I hopped on a train,\\u201d Tengo answered honestly.\\n\\nThe nurse gave him a look of mild disgust. Then she said, \\u201cVisitors are supposed to notify us before they arrive to see a patient. We have our schedules to meet, and the wishes of the patient must also be taken into account.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry. I didn\\u2019t know.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhen was your last visit?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTwo years ago.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTwo years ago,\\u201d she said as she checked the list of visitors with a ballpoint pen in hand. \\u201cYou mean to say that you have not made a single visit in two years?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s right,\\u201d Tengo said.\\n\\n\\u201cAccording to our records, you are Mr. Kawana\\u2019s only relative.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat is correct.\\u201d\\n\\nShe glanced at Tengo, but she said nothing. Her eyes were not blaming him, just checking the facts. Apparently, Tengo\\u2019s case was not exceptional.\\n\\n\\u201cAt the moment, your father is in group rehabilitation. That will end in half an hour. You can see him then.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow is he doing?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPhysically, he\\u2019s healthy. It\\u2019s in the other area that he has his ups and downs,\\u201d she said, tapping her temple with an index finger.\\n\\nTengo thanked her and went to wait in the lounge by the entrance, reading more of his book. A breeze passed through now and then, carrying the scent of the sea and the cooling sound of the pine windbreak outside. Cicadas clung to the branches of the trees, screeching their hearts out. Summer was at its height, but the cicadas seemed to know that it would not last long.\\n\\nEventually, the bespectacled nurse came to tell Tengo that he could see his father now. \\u201cI\\u2019ll show you to his room,\\u201d she said. Tengo got up from the sofa and, passing by a large mirror on the wall, realized for the first time what a sloppy outfit he was wearing: a Jeff Beck Japan Tour T-shirt under a faded dungaree shirt with mismatched buttons, chinos with specks of pizza sauce near one knee, a baseball cap\\u2014no way for a thirty-year-old son to dress on his first hospital visit to his father in two years. Nor did he have anything with him that might serve as a gift on such an occasion. No wonder the nurse had given him that look of disgust.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father was in his room, sitting in a chair by the open window, his hands on his knees. A nearby table held a potted plant with several delicate yellow flowers. The floor was made of some soft material to prevent injury in case of a fall. Tengo did not realize at first that the old man seated by the window was his father. He had shrunk\\u2014\\u201cshrivelled up\\u201d might be more accurate. His hair was shorter and as white as a frost-covered lawn. His cheeks were sunken, which may have been why the hollows of his eyes looked much bigger than they had before. Three deep creases marked his forehead. His eyebrows were extremely long and thick, and his pointed ears were larger than ever; they looked like bat wings. From a distance, he seemed less like a human being than like some kind of creature, a rat or a squirrel\\u2014a creature with some cunning. He was, however, Tengo\\u2019s father\\u2014or, rather, the wreckage of Tengo\\u2019s father. The father that Tengo remembered was a tough, hardworking man. Introspection and imagination might have been foreign to him, but he had his own moral code and a strong sense of purpose. The man Tengo saw before him was nothing but an empty shell.\\n\\n\\u201cMr. Kawana!\\u201d the nurse said to Tengo\\u2019s father in the crisp, clear tone she must have been trained to use when addressing patients. \\u201cMr. Kawana! Look who\\u2019s here! It\\u2019s your son, here from Tokyo!\\u201d\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father turned in his direction. His expressionless eyes made Tengo think of two empty swallow\\u2019s nests hanging from the eaves.\\n\\n\\u201cHello,\\u201d Tengo said.\\n\\nHis father said nothing. Instead, he looked straight at Tengo as if he were reading a bulletin written in a foreign language.\\n\\n\\u201cDinner starts at six-thirty,\\u201d the nurse said to Tengo. \\u201cPlease feel free to stay until then.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo hesitated for a moment after the nurse left, and then approached his father, sitting down in the chair opposite his\\u2014a faded, cloth-covered chair, its wooden parts scarred from long use. His father\\u2019s eyes followed his movements.\\n\\n\\u201cHow are you?\\u201d Tengo asked.\\n\\n\\u201cFine, thank you,\\u201d his father said formally.\\n\\nTengo did not know what to say after that. Toying with the third button of his dungaree shirt, he turned his gaze toward the pine trees outside and then back again to his father.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have come from Tokyo, is it?\\u201d his father asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, from Tokyo.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou must have come by express train.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s right,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cAs far as Tateyama. Then I transferred to a local for the trip here to Chikura.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019ve come to swim?\\u201d his father asked.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m Tengo. Tengo Kawana. Your son.\\u201d\\n\\nThe wrinkles in his father\\u2019s forehead deepened. \\u201cA lot of people tell lies because they don\\u2019t want to pay their NHK subscription fee.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFather!\\u201d Tengo called out to him. He had not spoken the word in a very long time. \\u201cI\\u2019m Tengo. Your son.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t have a son,\\u201d his father declared.\\n\\n\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have a son,\\u201d Tengo repeated mechanically.\\n\\nHis father nodded.\\n\\n\\u201cSo what am I?\\u201d Tengo asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re nothing,\\u201d his father said with two short shakes of the head.\\n\\nTengo caught his breath. He could find no words. Nor did his father have any more to say. Each sat in silence, searching through his own tangled thoughts. Only the cicadas sang without confusion, at top volume.\\n\\nHe may be speaking the truth, Tengo thought. His memory may have been destroyed, but his words are probably true.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d Tengo asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYou are nothing,\\u201d his father repeated, his voice devoid of emotion. \\u201cYou were nothing, you are nothing, and you will be nothing.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo wanted to get up from his chair, walk to the station, and go back to Tokyo then and there. But he could not stand up. He was like the young man who travelled to the town of cats. He had curiosity. He wanted a clearer answer. There was danger lurking, of course. But if he let this opportunity escape he would have no chance to learn the secret about himself. Tengo arranged and rearranged words in his head until at last he was ready to speak them. This was the question he had wanted to ask since childhood but could never quite manage to get out: \\u201cWhat you\\u2019re saying, then, is that you are not my biological father, correct? You are telling me that there is no blood connection between us, is that it?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStealing radio waves is an unlawful act,\\u201d his father said, looking into Tengo\\u2019s eyes. \\u201cIt is no different from stealing money or valuables, don\\u2019t you think?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re probably right.\\u201d Tengo decided to agree for now.\\n\\n\\u201cRadio waves don\\u2019t come falling out of the sky for free like rain or snow,\\u201d his father said.\\n\\nTengo stared at his father\\u2019s hands. They were lined up neatly on his knees. Small, dark hands, they looked tanned to the bone by long years of outdoor work.\\n\\n\\u201cMy mother didn\\u2019t really die of an illness when I was little, did she?\\u201d Tengo asked slowly.\\n\\nHis father did not answer. His expression did not change, and his hands did not move. His eyes focussed on Tengo as if they were observing something unfamiliar.\\n\\n\\u201cMy mother left you. She left you and me behind. She went off with another man. Am I wrong?\\u201d\\n\\nHis father nodded. \\u201cIt is not good to steal radio waves. You can\\u2019t get away with it, just doing whatever you want.\\u201d\\n\\nThis man understands my questions perfectly well. He just doesn\\u2019t want to answer them directly, Tengo thought.\\n\\n\\u201cFather,\\u201d Tengo addressed him. \\u201cYou may not actually be my father, but I\\u2019ll call you that for now because I don\\u2019t know what else to call you. To tell you the truth, I\\u2019ve never liked you. Maybe I\\u2019ve even hated you most of the time. You know that, don\\u2019t you? But, even supposing that there is no blood connection between us, I no longer have any reason to hate you. I don\\u2019t know if I can go so far as to be fond of you, but I think that at least I should be able to understand you better than I do now. I have always wanted to know the truth about who I am and where I came from. That\\u2019s all. If you will tell me the truth here and now, I won\\u2019t hate you anymore. In fact, I would welcome the opportunity not to have to hate you any longer.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father went on staring at him with expressionless eyes, but Tengo felt that he might be seeing the tiniest gleam of light somewhere deep within those empty swallow\\u2019s nests.\\n\\n\\u201cI am nothing,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cYou are right. I\\u2019m like someone who\\u2019s been thrown into the ocean at night, floating all alone. I reach out, but no one is there. I have no connection to anything. The closest thing I have to a family is you, but you hold on to the secret. Meanwhile, your memory deteriorates day by day. Along with your memory, the truth about me is being lost. Without the aid of truth, I am nothing, and I can never be anything. You are right about that, too.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKnowledge is a precious social asset,\\u201d his father said in a monotone, though his voice was somewhat quieter than before, as if someone had reached over and turned down the volume. \\u201cIt is an asset that must be amassed in abundant stockpiles and utilized with the utmost care. It must be handed down to the next generation in fruitful forms. For that reason, too, NHK needs to have all your subscription fees and\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nHe cut his father short. \\u201cWhat kind of person was my mother? Where did she go? What happened to her?\\u201d\\n\\nHis father brought his incantation to a halt, his lips shut tight.\\n\\nHis voice softer now, Tengo went on, \\u201cA vision often comes to me\\u2014the same one, over and over. I suspect it\\u2019s not so much a vision as a memory of something that actually happened. I\\u2019m one and a half years old, and my mother is next to me. She and a young man are holding each other. The man is not you. Who he is I have no idea, but he is definitely not you.\\u201d\\n\\nHis father said nothing, but his eyes were clearly seeing something else\\u2014something not there.\\n\\n\\u201cI wonder if I might ask you to read me something,\\u201d Tengo\\u2019s father said in formal tones after a long pause. \\u201cMy eyesight has deteriorated to the point where I can\\u2019t read books anymore. That bookcase has some books. Choose any one you like.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo got up to scan the spines of the volumes in the bookcase. Most of them were historical novels set in ancient times when samurai roamed the land. Tengo couldn\\u2019t bring himself to read his father some musty old book full of archaic language.\\n\\n\\u201cIf you don\\u2019t mind, I\\u2019d rather read a story about a town of cats,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s in a book that I brought to read myself.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cA story about a town of cats,\\u201d his father said, savoring the words. \\u201cPlease read that to me, if it is not too much trouble.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo looked at his watch. \\u201cIt\\u2019s no trouble at all. I have plenty of time before my train leaves. It\\u2019s an odd story. I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ll like it.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo pulled out his paperback and started reading slowly, in a clear, audible voice, taking two or three breaks along the way to catch his breath. He glanced at his father whenever he stopped reading but saw no discernible reaction on his face. Was he enjoying the story? He could not tell.\\n\\n\\u201cDoes that town of cats have television?\\u201d his father asked when Tengo had finished.\\n\\n\\u201cThe story was written in Germany in the nineteen-thirties. They didn\\u2019t have television yet back then. They did have radio, though.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDid the cats build the town? Or did people build it before the cats came to live there?\\u201d his father asked, speaking as if to himself.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cBut it does seem to have been built by human beings. Maybe the people left for some reason\\u2014say, they all died in an epidemic of some sort\\u2014and the cats came to live there.\\u201d\\n\\nHis father nodded. \\u201cWhen a vacuum forms, something has to come along to fill it. That\\u2019s what everybody does.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s what everybody does?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cExactly.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat kind of vacuum are you filling?\\u201d\\n\\nHis father scowled. Then he said with a touch of sarcasm in his voice, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you know?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Tengo said.\\n\\nHis father\\u2019s nostrils flared. One eyebrow rose slightly. \\u201cIf you can\\u2019t understand it without an explanation, you can\\u2019t understand it with an explanation.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo narrowed his eyes, trying to read the man\\u2019s expression. Never once had his father employed such odd, suggestive language. He always spoke in concrete, practical terms.\\n\\n\\u201cI see. So you are filling some kind of vacuum,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cAll right, then, who is going to fill the vacuum that you have left behind?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou,\\u201d his father declared, raising an index finger and thrusting it straight at Tengo. \\u201cIsn\\u2019t it obvious? I have been filling the vacuum that somebody else made, so you will fill the vacuum that I have made.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe way the cats filled the town after the people were gone.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cRight,\\u201d his father said. Then he stared vacantly at his own outstretched index finger as if at some mysterious, misplaced object.\\n\\nTengo sighed. \\u201cSo, then, who is my father?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJust a vacuum. Your mother joined her body with a vacuum and gave birth to you. I filled that vacuum.\\u201d\\n\\nHaving said that much, his father closed his eyes and closed his mouth.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd you raised me after she left. Is that what you\\u2019re saying?\\u201d\\n\\nAfter a ceremonious clearing of his throat, his father said, as if trying to explain a simple truth to a slow-witted child, \\u201cThat is why I said, \\u2018If you can\\u2019t understand it without an explanation, you can\\u2019t understand it with an explanation.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nTengo folded his hands in his lap and looked straight into his father\\u2019s face. This man is no empty shell, he thought. He is a flesh-and-blood human being with a narrow, stubborn soul, surviving in fits and starts on this patch of land by the sea. He has no choice but to coexist with the vacuum that is slowly spreading inside him. Eventually, that vacuum will swallow up whatever memories are left. It is only a matter of time.\\n\\nTengo said goodbye to his father just before 6 P.M. While he waited for the taxi to come, they sat across from each other by the window, saying nothing. Tengo had many more questions he wanted to ask, but he knew that he would get no answers. The sight of his father\\u2019s tightly clenched lips told him that. If you couldn\\u2019t understand something without an explanation, you couldn\\u2019t understand it with an explanation. As his father had said.\\n\\nWhen the time for him to leave drew near, Tengo said, \\u201cYou told me a lot today. It was indirect and often hard to grasp, but it was probably as honest and open as you could make it. I should be grateful for that.\\u201d\\n\\nStill his father said nothing, his eyes fixed on the view like a soldier on guard duty, determined not to miss the signal flare sent up by a savage tribe on a distant hill. Tengo tried looking out along his father\\u2019s line of vision, but all that was out there was the pine grove, tinted by the coming sunset.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to say it, but there is virtually nothing I can do for you\\u2014other than to hope that the process forming a vacuum inside you is a painless one. I\\u2019m sure you have suffered a lot. You loved my mother as deeply as you knew how. I do get that sense. But she left, and that must have been hard on you\\u2014like living in an empty town. Still, you raised me in that empty town.\\u201d\\n\\nA pack of crows cut across the sky, cawing. Tengo stood up, went over to his father, and put his hand on his shoulder. \\u201cGoodbye, Father. I\\u2019ll come again soon.\\u201d\\n\\nWith his hand on the doorknob, Tengo turned around one last time and was shocked to see a single tear escaping his father\\u2019s eye. It shone a dull silver color under the ceiling\\u2019s fluorescent light. The tear crept slowly down his cheek and fell onto his lap. Tengo opened the door and left the room.

The husband\\u2019s daughter came to lunch, too. She was the youngest of his three children, and she had recently walked the Appalachian Trail, all of it, from Maine to Georgia. Now she was moving to Wyoming to work on a cattle ranch. Her father didn\\u2019t mind this, but her mother, her grandparents, and even some of her friends objected strongly. The girl didn\\u2019t seem to care. She said that at first she had cared but then she saw that they were only jealous of her willingness to do what she wanted, free of expectations, and then she didn\\u2019t care anymore. She was twenty-one.\\n\\nHe thought of himself at twenty-one. Where had he been? He had been in college. Then he had graduated and begun to work, at a drug clinic. In the summer between college and working he went to study Italian at an immersion program in Vermont, but he was lonely and intimidated, and he left after three days. He thought of his wife\\u2019s sister\\u2019s husband\\u2019s daughter\\u2019s decision not to care what people thought of her. She had described it as a sort of switch: first she had cared, then she had not cared. The switch was her will. He could not remember ever applying his will to such drastic effect, particularly about other people and their feelings about him. This, he decided, was the essence of her courage and of his cowardice.\\n\\nThat night, while undressing, he tried to explain all this to his wife. She understood him immediately, but she raised a number of objections and mitigating forces.\\n\\n1.) The girl was overstating or misrepresenting her experience. She very likely did care what other people thought of her\\u2014especially her mother\\u2014and was portraying her transformation as stark only because it was a) more dramatic to speak that way, b) more self-aggrandizing to speak that way, and c) a means of convincing herself of her own courage, without which she would not be able to do what she was doing.\\n\\n2.) The girl was not known, given the stories her sister told about her, to be especially generous or compassionate, whereas by all reports he always had been, and these qualities\\u2014generosity and compassion\\u2014entailed their own form of courage: the courage to serve others. (At this he winced.)\\n\\n3.) At the time he had grown anxious and homesick and left the language school, his mother had been deathly ill, a detail that ought to soften his judgment of himself. It was important to consider context.\\n\\nHe thanked her, this woman who loved him and who didn\\u2019t judge him for those parts of himself that most troubled and shamed him, but he offered counterarguments to which he believed she would have no effective response.\\n\\n1.) Even if the girl was misrepresenting herself in order to bolster her spirits, this was, as he saw it, further evidence of her courage\\u2014courage consisting, as everyone knew, not of action in the absence of objections but action in the face of them.\\n\\n2.)

Would she cook and clean? He had meant to ask her but then the conversation had turned. Was she frightened at all? Did she have reservations? What resources of mind or spirit did she think she possessed to move to a place two thousand miles from her family, a place in which she knew nobody and the terrain and climate were utterly different from those which she had always known?

It was like this. I was staying at a cabin with my husband\\u2019s family over the Christmas break. This large dog, maybe two hundred and fifty pounds, came to the back door. He didn\\u2019t bark\\u2014he looked in through the glass pane and waited patiently. My father-in-law, who, as a child, had shared a home with a deer and a flying squirrel, opened the door.\\n\\nThat giant mountain dog came up the steps, crossed the room, and greeted me with a gentle head push. He put his nose down between his front paws, to make himself lower than me. He wagged his tail, gently. He had chosen me. He visited every day that week, for an hour or two in the morning, an hour or two in the afternoon, following me all around the house and out into the yard, too. I get along with dogs fine, generally, but this was something else. We loved each other. His nametag read \\u201cKush.\\u201d To the rest of the family, he was merely polite. I don\\u2019t know how to explain it, but my father\\u2019s spirit was in that dog. Yes, my father had also been giant, and gentle, but it was more than that. My father was paying me a visit. It was strange, but also obvious. This was some fifteen years ago. In the year or so after the encounter, it seemed like I was meeting Bernese mountain dogs in elevators and on sidewalks all the time, but, when I met Kush, who was also my father, he was the first Bernese mountain dog I\\u2019d ever seen.\\n\\nWhere were all those dogs now? The breed had surged in popularity, then, it seemed, vanished.\\n\\nI met the next ghost at a book-club meeting at the Boulder Public Library. I didn\\u2019t live in Boulder, I was passing through, but there was a notice in the newspaper about the book club, and my husband and I thought it sounded fun. I was a better person when I was young, and more open. The book club was reading \\u201cThe Overcoat,\\u201d by Nikolai Gogol. Poor Akaky Akakievich spends all his savings on a new overcoat; the coat is stolen; after a series of further humiliations, trying to reclaim the coat, he dies of a fever; there are reports of his ghost haunting St. Petersburg, stealing coats from others.\\n\\nIt was a mixed crowd at the book club. Was the story about bureaucracy? About human vanity? About folklore? Was it a satire, or a tragedy, etc. It was the usual discussion. But then a small, thin man sitting in the corner scolded us all for missing the point. \\u201cGhosts are real,\\u201d he said. The story was about a real ghost and \\u201cnone of you understand that.\\u201d The thin man said that he knew that ghosts were real because for years he had worked at a slaughterhouse in Broomfield.\\n\\nThe man\\u2019s comments were received politely, but he left the meeting frustrated. Upon reflection, it was clear, to me and my husband, that the man from Broomfield was himself a ghost. That was what he was trying to say.\\n\\nThe last ghost was a mom I knew only a little bit, from my youth. Her husband was a professional trumpeter. I babysat for her two boys a few times. The last time I did so, they were so out of control when their parents came home that I was never asked back again\\u2014which I thought was reasonable. Later, two very sad things happened in that family: one of the boys died in a car accident, and the mom had a seizure in the night and was found to have a brain tumor. By that time, I lived in a city thousands of miles away and hadn\\u2019t seen the family in years. But one night, more than a year after I learned of the tumor, I had a very vivid dream with Leona in it\\u2014Leona was the mom\\u2019s name\\u2014and we said hello and were very happy to see each other.

Ghosts aren\\u2019t real, but also they are? Or something like that. I don\\u2019t know what I wanted to communicate to her. Probably I was showing off. I said three ghosts. But wasn\\u2019t that misleading? I had spent so many years interested in ghosts, the dead, ancestors I\\u2019d never met, anything sad and gone\\u2014that world felt real to me.

The girls appreciate the boys because they are genuine and mean what they say. They are all gathered on the rooftop, discussing the boys' recent trip to Greece. They brought back cheap cigarettes, which they offer to the girls, and are proud of their find. The girls laugh, and one of them, Zoe, laughs with a distinctive sound reminiscent of Tinkerbell.\\n\\nThe narrator acknowledges the height of the rooftop and the potential danger if one of the boys were to fall. However, the girls cannot see the street below, making it harder for them to fully grasp the reality of the situation. The view from the rooftop offers no recognizable landmarks, only the boys' presence and their tanned bodies.

The boys are depicted as straightforward and assertive, and the girls are attracted to their direct manner.\\n\\nThe rooftop is located on a three-story house with high ceilings. The girls are aware that falling off the rooftop could result in death. However, on this particular night, the boys are behaving differently. They aren't indulging in roughhousing or drinking, instead they share stories about their trip to Greece, particularly about the cheap cigarettes they brought back. The girls find their pride amusing, and one of the girls named Zoe has a contagious laughter that mimics Tinkerbell.\\n\\nDespite being in Paris, with its famous landmarks like the Panth\\u00e9on and observatory, the girls feel detached and could be anywhere, inhibited by their limited view of the boys and their experiences rather than embracing the unique atmosphere of the city. The boys brush off suggestions to visit Berlin in favor of Athens, claiming that Athens is the new up-and-coming place, just as Berlin once was. The girls find themselves more immersed in their company than the surroundings which exemplified most creatively individual hubs.\\n\\nAs the sunset arrives, the girls comment on the pink sky, including comparing it to elements such as a childhood bed, a video game character, or beautiful floral coloration. They try to capture it with their phones but the boys dismiss the importance of posting pictures, claiming that it is only for grandmothers to see, alluding to the boys' lack of familial connections compared to the girls, who still have living grandmothers. Regardless, the boys emphasize their longing for Greece, sharing stories of their experiences with sailboating, sketching sculptures, and studying art history. Greece becomes an escape from their personal troubles such as struggling educationally, supporting sick mothers, pregnant girlfriends, as well as career impeding tasks, attending prestigious institutions far from Athenian allure.\\n\\nThe boys wish they could have stayed in Greece rather than returning to Paris to work on their art projects and deal with the challenges they face.

It was a clear, lovely stream, and many fish lived in it. Weeds grew there, too, and the fish ate the weeds. The fish didn\\u2019t care whether or not the kingdom had failed, of course. Whether it was a kingdom or a republic made no difference to them. They didn\\u2019t vote or pay taxes. Makes no difference to us, they figured.\\n\\nI washed my feet in the stream. A short soak in the icy-cold water turned them red. From the stream, you could see the walls and the tower of the castle in the kingdom that failed. The two-colored flag still flew from the tower, fluttering in the breeze. Everyone passing along the riverbanks would see the flag and say, \\u201cHey, look at that. It\\u2019s the flag of the kingdom that failed.\\u201d\\n\\nQ and I are friends\\u2014or should I say, were friends in college. It\\u2019s been more than ten years since the two of us did anything that friends do. Which is why I use the past tense. Anyhow, we were friends.\\n\\nWhenever I try to tell anyone about Q\\u2014to describe him as a person\\u2014I feel totally helpless. I\\u2019ve never been very good at explaining anything, but, even taking that into account, it\\u2019s a special challenge to try to explain Q to someone. And when I do try I\\u2019m overcome by a deep, deep sense of despair.\\n\\nLet me make this as simple as I can.\\n\\nQ and I are the same age, but he\\u2019s about five hundred and seventy times more handsome. He has a nice personality, too. He\\u2019s never pushy or boastful, and he never gets angry if someone accidentally causes a problem for him. \\u201cOh, well,\\u201d he\\u2019ll say. \\u201cI\\u2019ve done the same thing myself.\\u201d But, in fact, I\\u2019ve never heard of him doing anything bad to anyone.\\n\\nHe was well brought up, too. His father was a doctor who had his own clinic on the island of Shikoku, which meant that Q never wanted for pocket money. Not that he was extravagant with it. He was a smart dresser and also an impressive athlete, who\\u2019d played interscholastic tennis in high school. He enjoyed swimming and went to the pool at least twice a week. Politically, he was a moderate liberal. His grades, if not outstanding, were at least good. He almost never studied for exams, but he never failed a course. He really listened to the lectures.\\n\\nHe was surprisingly talented on the piano, and he owned a lot of Bill Evans and Mozart records. His favorite writers tended to be French\\u2014Balzac and Maupassant. Sometimes he\\u2019d read a novel by Kenzaburo Oe or another writer. His critiques were always right on the mark.\\n\\nHe was popular with women, naturally enough. But he was not one of those \\u201canyone he can get his hands on\\u201d type of guys. He had a steady girlfriend, a pretty sophomore from one of the fancy women\\u2019s colleges. They went out every Sunday.\\n\\nAnyhow, that was the Q I knew in college. In short, he was a character without flaws.\\n\\nBack then, Q lived in the apartment next door to mine. What with lending salt or borrowing salad dressing, we got to be friends, and soon we were at each other\\u2019s places all the time, listening to records, drinking beer. Once, my girlfriend and I drove out to the Kamakura shore with Q and his girlfriend. We were very comfortable together. Then, during the summer break of my senior year, I moved out, and that was that.\\n\\nThe next time I saw Q, almost a decade had gone by. I was reading a book by a swanky hotel pool near the Akasaka district. Q was sitting in the deck chair next to mine, and beside him was a beautiful long-legged woman in a bikini.\\n\\nI knew right away that it was Q. He was as handsome as ever, and now, just over thirty, he evinced a certain dignity that he hadn\\u2019t had before. Young women walking by gave him a quick once-over.\\n\\nHe didn\\u2019t notice me sitting next to him. I\\u2019m a fairly ordinary-looking guy, and I was wearing sunglasses. I wasn\\u2019t sure whether I should talk to him, but in the end I decided not to. He and the woman were deep in conversation, and I hesitated to interrupt them. Besides, there wasn\\u2019t a lot that he and I could have talked about. \\u201cI lent you salt, remember?\\u201d \\u201cHey, that\\u2019s right, and I borrowed a bottle of salad dressing.\\u201d We would have run out of topics quickly. So I kept my mouth shut and stuck to my book.\\n\\nStill, I couldn\\u2019t help overhearing what Q and his pretty companion were saying to each other. It was a fairly complicated matter. I gave up trying to read and listened to them.\\n\\n\\u201cNo way,\\u201d the woman said. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to be kidding.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI know, I know,\\u201d Q said. \\u201cI know exactly what you\\u2019re saying. But you\\u2019ve got to see it my way, too. I\\u2019m not doing this because I want to. It was the guys upstairs. I\\u2019m just telling you what they decided. So don\\u2019t look at me that way.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, right,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nQ let out a sigh.\\n\\nLet me summarize their long conversation\\u2014filling in a good deal by way of imagination, of course. Q seemed to be now a director at a TV station or some such place, and the woman was a moderately well-known singer or actress. She was being let go from a project because of some sort of trouble or scandal she had become involved in, or maybe just because her popularity had declined. The job of informing her had been left to Q, who was the person most directly responsible for day-to-day operations. I don\\u2019t know much about the entertainment industry, so I can\\u2019t be sure of the finer points, but I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019m too far off over all.\\n\\nJudging from what I heard, Q was discharging his duty with genuine sincerity.\\n\\n\\u201cWe can\\u2019t survive without sponsors,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t have to tell you that\\u2014you know the business.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSo you\\u2019re telling me that you don\\u2019t have any responsibility or say in the matter?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, I\\u2019m not telling you that. But what I can do is really limited.\\u201d\\n\\nTheir conversation took another turn into a dead-end street. She wanted to know just how much he had exerted himself on her behalf. He insisted that he had done everything he could, but he had no way to prove it, and she didn\\u2019t believe him. I didn\\u2019t really believe him, either. The more sincerely he tried to explain things, the more a fog of insincerity came to hang over everything. But it wasn\\u2019t Q\\u2019s fault. It wasn\\u2019t anybody\\u2019s fault. Which was why there was no way out of this conversation.\\n\\nIt appeared that the woman had always liked Q. I sensed that they had got along well until this business came up. Which probably only added to the woman\\u2019s anger. In the end, though, she was the one who gave in.\\n\\n\\u201cO.K.,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve had it. Buy me a Coke, will you?\\u201d\\n\\nWhen he heard that, Q breathed a sigh of relief and went off to the drink stand. The woman put on her sunglasses and stared straight ahead. By this time, I had read the same line in my book a couple hundred times.\\n\\nSoon, Q came back with two big paper cups. Handing one to the woman, he lowered himself into his deck chair. \\u201cDon\\u2019t get too depressed about this,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAny day now you\\u2019ll\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nBut, before he could finish, the woman threw her full cup at him. It caught him square in the face, and about a third of the Coca-Cola splashed onto me. Without a word, the woman stood up and, giving a little yank at the seat of her bikini, strode off without a backward glance. Q and I just sat there stunned for a good fifteen seconds. The people nearby were staring at us in shock.\\n\\nQ was the first to regain his composure. \\u201cSorry,\\u201d he said and held a towel out to me.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s O.K.,\\u201d I answered. \\u201cI\\u2019ll just take a shower.\\u201d\\n\\nLooking slightly annoyed, he drew the towel back and used it to dry himself.\\n\\n\\u201cAt least let me pay for the book,\\u201d he said. It was true that my book was soaked. But it was just a cheap paperback, and not a very interesting one at that. Anyone who threw a Coke on it and prevented me from reading it was doing me a favor. He brightened up when I said that. He had the same great smile as always.\\n\\nQ left at that point, apologizing to me once more as he stood to go. He had never realized who I was.\\n\\nI decided to give this story the title \\u201cThe Kingdom That Failed\\u201d because I happened to read an article in the evening paper that day about an African kingdom that had failed. \\u201cTo see a splendid kingdom fade away,\\u201d it said, \\u201cis far sadder than seeing a second-rate republic collapse.\\u201d\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story begins with the narrator describing a river behind a failed kingdom.

I met her in an Ibsen module at Copenhagen University. She always sat in the front row and spent the hour diligently taking notes, or giving answers before anyone else could during the tutorial sessions. I, too, knew the answers but I didn\\u2019t say them out loud; instead, I waited for someone else to speak. More often than not, she was that person. When she spoke, her \\u201ce,\\u201d \\u201ca,\\u201d and \\u201c\\u00e6\\u201d vowels were a little too crisp, a little too clean-sounding, like the rigsdansk of some bygone TV presenter.\\n\\nWe were the only Asians, two dark spots among the bright blond heads of varying shades, and I wondered if she had also been adopted by Danish parents, as was the case with many Asians in Denmark, brought up to think of themselves as Danish. The only thing Asian about us was our birth, and, of course, our appearance. Over the years, I had met a number of others like me: the first when I was fourteen, during a class trip to Paris; the second in my first year of university; another was presented to me at a Friday bar by a mutual friend; and a fourth, an adoptee from Norway, had been a kollegium floor-mate. Mette Honor\\u00e9, Helle Nielsen, Mia Kj\\u00e6rsgaard, Unn Fahlstr\\u00f8m. With each, things had never gone beyond the initial conversation, an exchange of backgrounds. I hadn\\u2019t given any of them much thought since our respective encounters, but I didn\\u2019t forget their names, which all belonged to Korean-born Scandinavian girls.\\n\\nAt first glance, Ditte seemed to fit the same mold. On the last day of class, I found her waiting for me in the corridor outside the auditorium. Up to then, she had behaved as if I wasn\\u2019t there, though she must have noticed me the same way I had noticed her. In the tone of someone who has rehearsed her words beforehand, she asked me if I wanted to get a beer at the cafeteria. As we walked in silence, I thought I knew what was coming. After all, I had been through this before with other adoptees. Like them, she was surprised when I told her that I had been born in Japan, not Korea. I wasn\\u2019t her first adoptee, but the ones she had met thus far had been girls. I was, in a manner of speaking, her first boy. I learned that we had arrived in Denmark at the ages of five months and six months, respectively. We were both a year younger than our fellow-students, who had, in the Danish tradition, taken a sabbatical year to work or travel.\\n\\nWas she really all that different from the other Korean girls I had met? That was what I found myself thinking, during our third outing, as I glanced at her shadowy profile next to me in the darkness of a cinema at Scala. Now I wonder if it wasn\\u2019t so much Ditte herself as how alike I thought we were that drew me to her. (Or perhaps that is the essence of attraction: a longing to see something of oneself in another.) Like looking into an enchanted mirror: when I looked at her, I saw a Dane who looked like me. I remember, one night, we lay face to face and gazed wordlessly into each other\\u2019s eyes until Ditte broke the spell by bursting into laughter. In bed, she was very clear about what she wanted, what she didn\\u2019t want, how she felt, and how she wanted to feel, demonstrating the same thoroughness she had shown in the classroom. Her scent, the consistency of her hair, the color of her nipples\\u2014everything about her was at once strange and familiar. When she told me that she had never used deodorant because she didn\\u2019t have to, I knew exactly what she was talking about. I had never bought a stick of deodorant in my life, though I had carried one around and even pretended to use it all through my upper-secondary years, so that I wouldn\\u2019t stand out among the other kids at my boarding school. A look of recognition seemed to dawn in her gaze when I told her about my constant need to prove myself when meeting new people. In retrospect, I\\u2019m not sure what these shared moments of understanding and complicity meant to her. Did they mean anything at all?\\n\\nWe were together for almost four months, during which time we explored Copenhagen as if for the first time, with new eyes. I had never noticed all the busts, bas-reliefs and other three-dimensional representations scattered throughout the city, which we baptized \\u201cthe city of statues\\u201d because the statues outnumbered the inhabitants, joked Ditte. She had grown up in Esbjerg, in West Jutland, and spent part of every summer on Fan\\u00f8, where her parents had a summer home overlooking the Wadden Sea. I had grown up in the Whiskey Belt, just north of Copenhagen, my summers punctuated by fishing trips with my father to the Faroe Islands. She loved salted black licorice, the typical Scandinavian kind. Before bed, I used to steal mine from the cabinet where my mother kept it in a glass jar shaped like a Swedish Dalecarlian horse. We both loved having \\u00f8llebr\\u00f8d for breakfast; observing the sky on bright summer nights when dusk seems to go on forever; watching old Danish television dramas like \\u201cJeg kan ikke vente til mandag!\\u201d and \\u201cOlive og Tom.\\u201d\\n\\nPerhaps a part of me already knew it couldn\\u2019t last, the theory of compatibility that I had constructed like scaffolding around us, and whose fragile symmetry I marvelled at in secret. We were too alike, I remember thinking; it wasn\\u2019t normal to be this close to someone in so short a time, like skipping to the end of a book one has been reading too fast from the start. But the mirror at last reflected someone back at me. Around that time, I had a strange dream. In it, Ditte was my sister, the two of us separated at birth, and, although I knew such a thing to be impossible\\u2014my blood was Japanese, hers was Korean, after all\\u2014I woke in the dark with an erection, my heart beating like a tam-tam. I was alone in my bed; Ditte had gone back to her hall of residence at some point during the night without waking me. When we saw each other again, I made the mistake of telling her about my dream. Though I had left out the part about my erection, bewilderment and disgust clouded her face, as if I had laid bare some unspeakable fantasy. She asked me if that was how I had always seen her. The thought of an incestuous relationship with a long-lost sister had never crossed my mind, I said, but Ditte refused to believe me.\\n\\nThings were never the same after that. One day, she informed me of her intention to spend the weekend in Esbjerg, where her parents still lived. We had often talked about going together, but the trip had never materialized. The following night, I received a phone call; in the background I heard voices, music, as though she had called me from a party. She seemed distracted or irritated by something. We ended the conversation without saying goodbye. I eventually learned that she had left me for her thesis supervisor, who also happened to be my thesis supervisor. After that, I couldn\\u2019t walk past certain places\\u2014the statue of Adam Oehlenschl\\u00e4ger near the zoo in Norske All\\u00e9, the skating rink in N\\u00f8rrebro Park, even the oil tanks at Pr\\u00f8vestenen\\u2014without being reminded of her. The worst was going to see my thesis supervisor. I couldn\\u2019t be sure, but it seemed that the man had no idea about me and Ditte. He was out of shape, dark-haired (for a blond Dane), and his chin receded a bit. Other than his vast and bottomless intelligence, his daggerlike wit, his impressive list of publications, what could she possibly see in him? And that was when I realized that I had never really known her, any more than I had known the adopted Korean girls before her. She had become a name to add to the others. All this time, I had thought of her as a mirror, a strange and beguiling reflection, but it would seem that she had been drawn to me because I was different, a change from all the Danes she had previously dated.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The protagonist is a third-year student at Copenhagen University who feels unsure of himself and his place in the world.

It\\u2019s the first time I\\u2019ve heard the term. Black mold is worse than other mold, it seems. I know about green mold, but I\\u2019ve always just called it mold. For asthmatics, like Carl, black mold can be plain dangerous. Carl decontaminates the fridge. He holds his breath and sprays. I\\u2019m on the toilet, door open. That\\u2019s how well we know each other.\\n\\nCarl shares the apartment with a friend. Martin is hard to read. Smart, a slacker with tunnel vision. He wears a thick ring, inlaid with a ruby. The ruby looks like a blood blister. He doesn\\u2019t talk to me. Sometimes he grunts. I\\u2019m not sure if the sounds he makes have their own meaning, or if they are uttered out of pure necessity. Martin eats baby food out of glass jars. I hear the click when he opens a jar, a guarantee that its vacuum seal is intact. The baby food is the opposite of the black mold. Martin eats the baby food in bed and watches porn while wrapped in a blanket with a Betty Boop print. This is what he is: grunt, click, baby food, click, porn, click. With a future as a banker and a high-income individual, click. I can\\u2019t imagine him being able to get hard, jerk off, come. It\\u2019s as if growing or shrinking didn\\u2019t exist for him.\\n\\nWhen Martin drags himself to lectures, I borrow his porn mags, which he keeps in a rattan magazine stand that may once have held yarn or knitting patterns. A small boatneck sailor shirt for a grandchild. A beanie with a pompom on it. I think Martin harbors a lot of tenderness.\\n\\nOne centerfold shows a woman on all fours, with a machine gun hanging at a diagonal between her legs, against a backdrop of camouflage netting. She\\u2019s wearing a military cap and feminine boots. Her lower back arches under the weight of her own willingness, and the cartridge belt burns into her skin like the lick of a whip. Or does it offer relief, like a doctor\\u2019s cool fingertips searching for an inflamed tendon? Her buttocks are shiny. All of her is shiny, rubbed with oil. You can glide right into any of her orifices.\\n\\nCarl has a water bed. He never changes the sheets. It doesn\\u2019t matter. He smells good. When I stay with Carl I sleep in Carl\\u2019s bed. Sometimes we fuck. It\\u2019s nice, and it feels like the beginning or the end of a love story. Always either the beginning or the end.\\n\\nCarl has a friend called Lizzy. She braids her hair and makes side buns. She wears dresses with puffed sleeves and lacing at the waist. Is this a form of irony? When I comment on the cross-stitching with a polite enthusiasm, she points out that it references a type of folklore. The dress was sewn and embroidered by a Polish Jewish aunt on her mother\\u2019s side. She talks endlessly about her family. It turns out that she and Carl are related somehow. Lizzy is the chairperson of a comedic am-dram society. I can just picture her with a wine-red costume, a tall hat, drumsticks, maybe a drum, too. When she does let her hair down, it\\u2019s as if she were naked, horny, drunk, limitless. It\\u2019s as if she\\u2019d become the pornographic centerfold. Carl has sex with her without telling me. I find out from Martin. So Martin does, in fact, talk to me. Just that once. He punctuates his sentence with a \\u201cmoop, moop.\\u201d\\n\\nLizzy is both clean and fuckable. Strict, consistent, selfish in an honest way. I\\u2019m more . . . It\\u2019s twofold. I try to figure out how I\\u2019m supposed to fit into this. I often think of the word \\u201cdivision.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen I meet Johan, the situation changes. I fall in love with Johan, and Johan thinks he has fallen in love with me. And, when this happens, I suspect that Carl is in love with me, too. That\\u2019s why I lie to Carl about Johan. Johan and I meet in secret. I want to be like Johan. When I\\u2019m alone, all I am is him. Johan says this: \\u201cThe smell between the teeth, the one that comes out when you floss, is disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.\\u201d And I know I\\u2019ll never forget the way he says \\u201cdisgusting.\\u201d The word is divorced from everything that has to do with Johan\\u2019s sense of humor, that has to do with us. Disgusting. It\\u2019s a word that\\u2019s fixed to Johan\\u2019s world view. When Johan takes a trip, I borrow his clothes and practice his gestures. Thinking of myself and of existence as \\u201cdisgusting\\u201d helps with my longing. The disgust doesn\\u2019t plug the hole, but it does decontaminate it.\\n\\nI have clean, white teeth. Under Johan\\u2019s bed, I find two used condoms. I don\\u2019t let on about the condoms. They\\u2019re something else: dry petals, a thumb brace, masking tape. Picking them up and putting them in the trash is no skin off my back. I feel the same silent satisfaction that applies to all forms of cleaning.\\n\\nCarl finds out that Johan and I are together. He says that he doesn\\u2019t want to see me. That I should make myself scarce. I remind him that he and I aren\\u2019t together and never have been. He says that it doesn\\u2019t matter what we are or have been. What\\u2019s interesting is that I\\u2019ve been lying. I remind him that he\\u2019s been lying, too. If he was in love with me and didn\\u2019t say anything, wasn\\u2019t that a form of lying? Carl says that what I need is a foundation course in philosophy. He says that I should ask for forgiveness, but, when I reply that first I\\u2019d need to know what I\\u2019m asking forgiveness for, he says that this is exactly the problem.\\n\\nOur student union hosts a costume party. The theme is comic-book and cartoon characters. The girls are Minnie Mouse, Wonder Woman, Daisy Duck, Betty Boop. I\\u2019m the Hulk. I smear myself with green paint. Rub olive oil and dry shampoo into my hair. I tear up a pair of jeans and a plaid shirt. The only person who\\u2019d like me like this is Johan. But Johan is at a toga party across town.\\n\\nCarl is dressed as the Practical Pig. Overalls, pig mask. I don\\u2019t know who the Practical Pig is. He looks like a member of the Ku Klux Klan. The American South. Mangrove swamps. Banjo on the porch. Root beer. Cornbread. Violence. The heart is a lonely hunter. Carl is the opposite of all that. Except when it comes to the heart. He has a hunting license. When he sees me he delivers a slap that knocks me off my feet. He asks how dare I be here. Another Practical Pig, identically dressed but fat and maskless, comes charging. He pushes Carl and grabs me by the shoulders, gets covered in green paint. I cry a little. Not because this hurts. But because everything hurts. He takes me to his dorm, opens a can of mussels, fries rice. Hands me shower gel, two in one. When I am nice and clean I am given food and a robe. He plays Miles Davis on the grand piano in the living room. It\\u2019s morning, and the smell of cardamom drifts over from the bakery opposite. The students in the building make coffee and go to their lectures. I almost doze off on the sofa, and Practical gives me a kiss on the forehead. I embrace him. He is moist and engorged.\\n\\nJohan says that he isn\\u2019t in love with me. He likes me. He\\u2019s interested in me. But I don\\u2019t have it in me anymore. I can\\u2019t be wearing Johan\\u2019s clothes. They don\\u2019t fit me. I can barely move. Nothing is disgusting.\\n\\nI give Carl severe shortness of breath. He misses his exam. Hisses into the hospital phone that I\\u2019m killing him. I\\u2019m crying. I like Carl. He didn\\u2019t beat me up. He gave me a slap. As you do in his circles. You hunt, shoot birds, decontaminate, dole out slaps. You don\\u2019t lie. You withhold love. I say I\\u2019m sorry. Sorry for being cowardly and unclear. For not knowing much about integrity and honor. But I don\\u2019t understand what\\u2019s being said. The mix of words and actions, tenderness, violence.\\n\\nI read Janson\\u2019s \\u201cHistory of Art\\u201d for my art-history class.

A mirror, with photographs stuck into the frame, reflected a brush, a comb, and a pincushion in the shape of a heart. I gave the door what I told myself might have been an accidental push. It revealed the corner of somebody\\u2019s bed covered with a shiny green counterpane. I knew that I must not walk into other people\\u2019s bedrooms\\u2014should not be looking in.

I noticed them as I stepped out of a medical building. I noticed them because everything else in my peripheral vision shifted but they did not. The wind was blowing the leaves, the leaves were dying and leaping, and the couple was so still. The couple was unmoving. I was, too, looking at them. So it was the three of us as everything else moved, constant and full and wide. People brushed by our shoulders, sweeping our sides as they strode toward their destinations. People were busy. People didn\\u2019t care about the couple standing in the middle of the uneven sidewalk. People stirred around them like the sea, splashing against their ankles.\\n\\nThe man held her arms, his manicured fingers grasping hard.\\n\\nNear the couple, there was a burned chair: garbage, darkened wood, charred remnants.

The building they entered was severe: red brick, steel, iron, and glass. Ugly.

I thought of the burned chair sitting outside the medical building, the consequence of this location, its wooden frame peeling.\\n\\nWhen the light turned on in the fourth window from the right, on the second floor, I felt relief.

Desires he had none. Man-made objects were to him either hives of evil, vibrant with a malignant activity that he alone could perceive, or gross comforts for which no use could be found in his abstract world. After eliminating a number of articles that might offend him or frighten him (anything in the gadget line, for instance, was taboo), his parents chose a dainty and innocent trifle\\u2014a basket with ten different fruit jellies in ten little jars.\\n\\nAt the time of his birth, they had already been married for a long time; a score of years had elapsed, and now they were quite old. Her drab gray hair was pinned up carelessly. She wore cheap black dresses. Unlike other women of her age (such as Mrs. Sol, their next-door neighbor, whose face was all pink and mauve with paint and whose hat was a cluster of brookside flowers), she presented a naked white countenance to the faultfinding light of spring. Her husband, who in the old country had been a fairly successful businessman, was now, in New York, wholly dependent on his brother Isaac, a real American of almost forty years\\u2019 standing. They seldom saw Isaac and had nicknamed him the Prince.\\n\\nThat Friday, their son\\u2019s birthday, everything went wrong. The subway train lost its life current between two stations and for a quarter of an hour they could hear nothing but the dutiful beating of their hearts and the rustling of newspapers. The bus they had to take next was late and kept them waiting a long time on a street corner, and when it did come, it was crammed with garrulous high-school children. It began to rain as they walked up the brown path leading to the sanitarium. There they waited again, and instead of their boy, shuffling into the room, as he usually did (his poor face sullen, confused, ill-shaven, and blotched with acne), a nurse they knew and did not care for appeared at last and brightly explained that he had again attempted to take his life. He was all right, she said, but a visit from his parents might disturb him. The place was so miserably understaffed, and things got mislaid or mixed up so easily, that they decided not to leave their present in the office but to bring it to him next time they came.\\n\\nOutside the building, she waited for her husband to open his umbrella and then took his arm. He kept clearing his throat, as he always did when he was upset. They reached the bus-stop shelter on the other side of the street and he closed his umbrella. A few feet away, under a swaying and dripping tree, a tiny unfledged bird was helplessly twitching in a puddle.\\n\\nDuring the long ride to the subway station, she and her husband did not exchange a word, and every time she glanced at his old hands, clasped and twitching upon the handle of his umbrella, and saw their swollen veins and brown-spotted skin, she felt the mounting pressure of tears. As she looked around, trying to hook her mind onto something, it gave her a kind of soft shock, a mixture of compassion and wonder, to notice that one of the passengers\\u2014a girl with dark hair and grubby red toenails\\u2014was weeping on the shoulder of an older woman. Whom did that woman resemble? She resembled Rebecca Borisovna, whose daughter had married one of the Soloveichiks\\u2014in Minsk, years ago.\\n\\nThe last time the boy had tried to do it, his method had been, in the doctor\\u2019s words, a masterpiece of inventiveness; he would have succeeded had not an envious fellow-patient thought he was learning to fly and stopped him just in time. What he had really wanted to do was to tear a hole in his world and escape.\\n\\nThe system of his delusions had been the subject of an elaborate paper in a scientific monthly, which the doctor at the sanitarium had given to them to read. But long before that, she and her husband had puzzled it out for themselves. \\u201cReferential mania,\\u201d the article had called it. In these very rare cases, the patient imagines that everything happening around him is a veiled reference to his personality and existence. He excludes real people from the conspiracy, because he considers himself to be so much more intelligent than other men. Phenomenal nature shadows him wherever he goes. Clouds in the staring sky transmit to each other, by means of slow signs, incredibly detailed information regarding him. His in- most thoughts are discussed at nightfall, in manual alphabet, by darkly gesticulating trees. Pebbles or stains or sun flecks form patterns representing, in some awful way, messages that he must intercept. Everything is a cipher and of everything he is the theme. All around him, there are spies. Some of them are detached observers, like glass surfaces and still pools; others, such as coats in store windows, are prejudiced witnesses, lynchers at heart; others, again (running water, storms), are hysterical to the point of insanity, have a distorted opinion of him, and grotesquely misinterpret his actions. He must be always on his guard and devote every minute and module of life to the decoding of the undulation of things. The very air he exhales is indexed and filed away. If only the interest he provokes were limited to his immediate surroundings, but, alas, it is not! With distance, the torrents of wild scandal increase in volume and volubility. The silhouettes of his blood corpuscles, magnified a million times, flit over vast plains; and still farther away, great mountains of unbearable solidity and height sum up, in terms of granite and groaning firs, the ultimate truth of his being.\\n\\nWhen they emerged from the thunder and foul air of the subway, the last dregs of the day were mixed with the street lights. She wanted to buy some fish for supper, so she handed him the basket of jelly jars, telling him to go home. Accordingly, he returned to their tenement house, walked up to the third landing, and then remembered he had given her his keys earlier in the day.\\n\\nIn silence he sat down on the steps and in silence rose when, some ten minutes later, she came trudging heavily up the stairs, smiling wanly and shaking her head in deprecation of her silliness. They entered their two-room flat and he at once went to the mirror. Straining the corners of his mouth apart by means of his thumbs, with a horrible, mask-like grimace, he removed his new, hopelessly uncomfortable dental plate. He read his Russian-language newspaper while she laid the table. Still reading, he ate the pale victuals that needed no teeth. She knew his moods and was also silent.\\n\\nWhen he had gone to bed, she remained in the living room with her pack of soiled playing cards and her old photograph albums. Across the narrow courtyard, where the rain tinkled in the dark against some ash cans, windows were blandly alight, and in one of them a black-trousered man, with his hands clasped under his head and his elbows raised, could he seen lying supine on an untidy bed. She pulled the blind down and examined the photographs. As a baby, he looked more surprised than most babies. A photograph of a German maid they had had in Leipzig and her fat-faced fianc\\u00e9 fell out of a fold of the album. She turned the pages of the book: Minsk, the Revolution, Leipzig, Berlin, Leipzig again, a slanting house front, badly out of focus. Here was the boy when he was four years old, in a park, shyly, with puckered forehead, looking away from an eager squirrel, as he would have from any other stranger. Here was Aunt Rosa, a fussy, angular, wild-eyed old lady, who had lived in a tremulous world of bad news, bankruptcies, train accidents, and cancerous growths until the Germans put her to death, together with all the people she had worried about. The boy, aged six\\u2014that was when he drew wonderful birds with human hands and feet, and suffered from insomnia like a grown-up man. His cousin, now a famous chess player. The boy again, aged about eight, already hard to understand, afraid of the wallpaper in the passage, afraid of a certain picture in a book, which merely showed an idyllic landscape with rocks on a hillside and an old cart wheel hanging from the one branch of a leafless tree. Here he was at ten\\u2014the year they left Europe. She remembered the shame, the pity, the humiliating difficulties of the journey, and the ugly, vicious, backward children he was with in the special school where he had been placed after they arrived in America. And then came a time in his life, coinciding with a long convalescence after pneumonia, when those little phobias of his, which his parents had stubbornly regarded as the eccentricities of a prodigiously gifted child, hardened, as it were, into a dense tangle of logically interacting illusions, making them totally inaccessible to normal minds.\\n\\nAll this, and much more, she had accepted, for, after all, living does mean accepting the loss of one joy after another, not even joys in her case, mere possibilities of improvement. She thought of the recurrent waves of pain that for some reason or other she and her husband had had to endure; of the in visible giants hurting her boy in some unimaginable fashion; of the incalculable amount of tenderness contained in the world; of the fate of this tenderness, which is either crushed or wasted, or transformed into madness; of neglected children humming to themselves in unswept corners; of beautiful weeds that cannot hide from the farmer.\\n\\nIt was nearly midnight when, from the living room, she heard her husband moan, and presently he staggered in, wearing over his nightgown the old overcoat with the astrakhan collar that he much preferred to his nice blue bathrobe.\\n\\n\\u201cI can\\u2019t sleep!\\u201d he cried.\\n\\n\\u201cWhy can\\u2019t you sleep?\\u201d she asked. \\u201cYou were so tired.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI can\\u2019t sleep because I am dying,\\u201d he said, and lay down on the couch.\\n\\n\\u201cIs it your stomach?

Otherwise, we\\u2019ll be responsible.... Responsible!\\u201d He hurled himself into a sitting position, both feet on the floor, thumping his forehead with his clenched fist.\\n\\n\\u201cAll right,\\u201d she said quietly. \\u201cWe will bring him home tomorrow morning.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI would like some tea,\\u201d said her husband and went out to the bathroom.\\n\\nBending with difficulty, she retrieved some playing cards and a photograph or two that had slipped to the floor\\u2014the knave of hearts, the nine of spades, the ace of spades, the maid Elsa and her bestial beau. He returned in high spirits, saying in a loud voice, \\u201cI have it all figured out. We will give him the bedroom. Each of us will spend part of the night near him and the other part on this couch. We will have the doctor see him at least twice a week. It does not matter what the Prince says.

He stood in the middle of the room, groping with his foot for one slipper that had come off, and childishly, toothlessly, gaped at his wife. Since she knew more English than he, she always attended to the calls.\\n\\n\\u201dCan I speak to Charlie?\\u201d a girl\\u2019s dull little voice said to her now.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat number do you want? . . . No. You have the wrong number.\\u201d\\n\\nShe put the receiver down gently and her hand went to her heart. \\u201cIt frightened me,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nHe smiled a quick smile and immediately resumed his excited monologue. They would fetch him as soon as it was day. For his own protection, they would keep all the knives in a locked drawer. Even at his worst, he presented no danger to other people.\\n\\nThe telephone rang a second time.\\n\\nThe same toneless, anxious young voice asked for Charlie.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have the incorrect number. I will tell you what you are doing. You are turning the letter \\u2018o\\u2019 instead of the zero.\\u201d She hung up again.\\n\\nThey sat down to their unexpected, festive midnight tea. He sipped noisily; his face was flushed; every now and then he raised his glass with a circular motion, so as to make the sugar dissolve more thoroughly. The vein on the side of his bald head stood out conspicuously, and silvery bristles showed on his chin. The birthday present stood on the table. While she poured him another glass of tea, he put on his spectacles and re\\u00ebxamined with pleasure the luminous yellow, green, and red little jars.

During their conversation, the phone rings twice with wrong numbers, creating further tension in the already melancholic atmosphere.\\n\\nAs the story ends, the couple sits down for a midnight snack, where the man admires the fruit jelly jars. They enjoy tea and contemplate their son's condition, eventually deciding to bring him home the following day.

She sometimes said to him that the only time she felt a spark of desire was when they were out in the world, and they encountered an older couple taking care of their young grandchildren, children similar ages to their own. This became their private joke, which she didn\\u2019t repeat to others, knowing that others would most likely just find it inappropriate or sad. That\\u2019s my pornography, she would say. To watch an older man, relatively fit, at a kindergartener\\u2019s birthday party, just bending over and picking something up. Ooh, yeah, Grandpa, she would whisper privately to her spouse. That\\u2019s right. Pick up that empty juice box. Slowly, slowly. Yeah, put it in the garbage can. Ooh. That\\u2019s right. Do it. Do it. Sit in that chair. Get up from that chair. Oh, fuck, you can pick her up? Pick her up. Pick up that five-year-old body. And so on. The joke had an undercurrent of melancholy and exhaustion, like so much of what she was feeling lately. Her elderly father was alive, but he lived far away, or she lived far away from him, she imagined he\\u2019d say, and there was a division between them, even when he visited, which he hadn\\u2019t for a while, because of his failing health, and also because of what was going on in the world. When her father came to visit, he sat in a chair, which he didn\\u2019t do very well, as he often had to be helped out of it. He couldn\\u2019t stand for long periods of time, and, when she had given him the baby to hold, his first time meeting her, six months after she was born, he\\u2019d almost dropped her. Everyone she knew, it seemed, had parents who were often and actively present, who would come and stay for a while in a spare room\\u2014another miracle, the guest room\\u2014or who sometimes even moved in order to be closer to their children and their children\\u2019s children. They were present, for birthday parties, for trick-or-treating, even for dance classes, soccer, and school pickups, like strange apparitions of help and care. Despite her jokes about her fantasy, sometimes the physical proximity of these grandparents made her feel unbearably alienated, even as she enjoyed making small talk with them. They were, more often than not, impressed by her and her accomplishments, which was so different from both her father and her in-laws, who regarded her as significant only for having produced grandchildren, whom they did not make extraordinary efforts to see, because they all disliked the city, were convinced they\\u2019d be murdered in broad daylight upon entering it, because of what they\\u2019d seen on the news. It made sense to have children if you knew that you would have someone to support you. In evolutionary terms, it turned out, this was called the \\u201cgrandmother theory\\u201d: having a grandmother to help with the children had been promoting longevity and survival all the way back to the hunter-gatherer days. There were articles, in the Health and Aging section of the paper, about how to stay fit as you got older so that you could be present for your grandchildren. There was something about this that irritated her, the idea that she was supposed to stay healthy and sharp enough so that, at the end of her life, she could again find herself picking up after young children, without any wage or recompense, in this future and speculative identity of grandmother. As she was complaining about this, her friend suggested that perhaps what she needed was a replacement grandparent. Although the friend said this in a joking way, she found herself thinking about, even fantasizing about, this idea. Since her mother had been dead for twenty years, could she somehow find a replacement grandmother? Many cultures had the practice of hiring a designated mourner; a replacement grandmother would be something like that. Could she find someone to care if the baby had had a fever for five days, and to ask questions, and to check in? She couldn\\u2019t afford to hire a babysitter, even occasionally, so how could she possibly afford a replacement grandmother? But that was the thing: it would have to be a volunteer position, or it wouldn\\u2019t work. It would have to be someone who took an interest in the ordinary repetitions of her day, and who found her children special. But, for it to work, that person would have to know her, have intimate knowledge of her history, know even what she herself had been like as a small child. Otherwise the performance of love and devotion would feel empty, or artificial, like the rehearsed gestures of mourning.

I put slim envelopes in their slots. I sorted Amazon deliveries, media mail, care packages in padded envelopes sent Priority from loving parents. Dubrowsky, Dunn, Dunton. There was intimacy in watching the movements of the campus, the coming and going, even in everyone\\u2019s absence.\\n\\nThen, in the evenings, I went back to my room and read until I ran out of pages. Then I called my mom on Skype.\\n\\nAnd have you been eating? she asked. Have you been going outside? Being careful out there?

She worried about me living so far away, alone in America.\\n\\nShe\\u2019d watched a movie about a couple of girls left behind at a boarding school upstate. The snow made the campus look bleak. Emma Roberts had dark circles under her eyes. Everyone died.\\n\\nDon\\u2019t go down into the basement, she said. Avoid long hallways. Don\\u2019t go out late at night.\\n\\nWhen she heard on the news that a snowstorm was passing through Vermont, she e-mailed me to ask if I needed company. A friend to marvel at the thunder with, she wrote.\\n\\nI called her as soon as I woke up, before I ate my breakfast.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve never seen a snowstorm, she said. She brought her face closer to the screen. Where is it?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s over, I said.\\n\\nI showed her my window. The sky looked blank like a sheet, icicles hanging from the frame like teeth in a child\\u2019s drawing. Sunlight flooded the Webcam, and for a moment my corner of the screen was all white. I reappeared as a silhouette, and then as my full self again.\\n\\nCall me if something happens, while it\\u2019s still happening, she said. I want to see it live.\\n\\nThen she went on to list every storm fact she knew.\\n\\nSandstorms on Mars, other storms on the moon. Every tragedy on Earth. Floods, tsunamis, earthquakes. She talked until I had to say, Mom, it\\u2019s getting late. I have to get ready for work.\\n\\nOn a particularly cold day, I sent my mother a picture of the snow falling onto the soccer field out my window, which I knew she found serene, beautiful even, but this time she found it scary.\\n\\nDoes walking outside feel like being buried alive? she asked.\\n\\nAnd I said that it didn\\u2019t, though the truth was that sometimes it did. I\\u2019d have to dust the snow off my shoulders and the creases in my coat before I walked in, my legs heavy, my jaw frozen, my hands burning.\\n\\nShe told me to stay indoors as much as I could, not to leave my room again until it was warm outside.\\n\\nThen she shook her head.\\n\\nNo, don\\u2019t listen to me.\\n\\nShe yawned then looked past me, at something behind her screen. A lock of her hair fell on her eyes, and she didn\\u2019t move it away.\\n\\nIt was later there than where I was, way past midnight. I let her go to bed, and I stayed up, all the lights in my room still on.\\n\\nI sat in front of the computer, wondering what I should do next, now that I was alone.

I felt it would take too much effort to enter their world that night, to move between Brazil and the United States and then England in the course of a day.\\n\\nThe computer screen went dark, and I saw my own face reflected in it. I looked pale and tired, papery, even, as if covered in mildew. I got up and splashed cold water on my face in the bathroom down the hall, then put on my coat and boots and went out on a walk.\\n\\nFrom the middle of the soccer field, in the dark, I could see into my bedroom on the third floor, and into the bedrooms of my neighbors. A shadow moved across a room. Two girls laughed together in another, tilting back their heads, with no sound. In my room, the window framed a perfect image of stillness. The whole world seemed to quieten down for that moment, for me to look at what my life looks like.\\n\\nI called her again when I thought she\\u2019d be awake, and her face glowed in the dark, lit up by nothing but the computer screen.\\n\\nWere you asleep?\\n\\nThe light was giving me a headache, she said, and took her hand to her brow.\\n\\nEverything gave her migraines in those days. She felt dizzy, her ears rang, her eyes twitched. To protect herself, she had to live in a world of blandness, often in silence, often in the dark, warm gauze over her eyes.\\n\\nIt occurred to me that she\\u2019d love the milk carton and the campus. The carpeted halls and the snow muffling every sound, the dining-hall food, the constant darkness, nighttime always spilling into mornings.\\n\\nI told her this, and she said, Can you imagine? If the moment I got there and ate your food and slept on your bed and walked around in your clothes I was suddenly cured?\\n\\nI told her about my walk to the soccer field.\\n\\nShe smiled and said, So it turns out you do listen to what I say.\\n\\nI do, I do.\\n\\nJust don\\u2019t go on these walks when it\\u2019s dark out, she said. Have you heard about the Filipino student who got murdered somewhere in New York last week? Not too far from you.\\n\\nI laughed, happy that she was back to being so unmistakably herself.\\n\\nWhen winter break was almost over, my mother e-mailed me to say that she\\u2019d received the package I\\u2019d sent her for Christmas, a few weeks too late, when I\\u2019d already forgotten about it.\\n\\nOn Skype, she waited with the box on her lap so we could open it together, her hands on my address.\\n\\nI can\\u2019t believe this came all the way from America, she said.\\n\\nShe turned the box to the screen to show me the customs label I\\u2019d filled out.\\n\\nLook, I\\u2019m touching your handwriting, she said.

I can barely recognize it.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t write in cursive anymore, I said. Not since I was a kid.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s it, she said. It\\u2019s very grownup now.

Neat lines of blur.\\n\\nShe went through the rest of the contents of the box: a tiny bottle of maple syrup, a little bag of peppermint candy, a blue shawl.\\n\\nShe put the computer on the coffee table then stood up and draped the shawl over her shoulders, swaying from side to side.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s like a hug, she said. A cocoon.\\n\\nShe sat back down and curled up on the couch, covering the length of her body with it, the shawl as a blanket, all the way up to her chin.\\n\\nWill you talk me to sleep?\\n\\nI nodded, but then I couldn\\u2019t think of anything to say.\\n\\nI thought maybe I could read her a story instead. Something soothing, nothing like the news.\\n\\nI looked around my room for a book in Portuguese, something we could both understand, and then I realized there was nothing.

The builders, in their defense, said that the layer had simply been forgotten about, not left out in an intentional move to save money. The building was faculty housing, occupied only by professors and their families. All but one professor were untenured. Half had kids under ten.\\n\\nThe layer had been found to be missing during a city inspection a decade ago. Repairs were put off for nine years. The school, as both employer and landlord, cited extreme busyness, and pointed out that, despite the missing barrier, no actual apartment floods had occurred. Year ten there was a global pandemic, but year ten was also the end of the remediation period, so construction had to start. The contractor hosted a virtual meeting to explain the many phases of the process. The slide show had several typos. \\u201cDemolition\\u201d became \\u201cdemonition\\u201d; no apartment number was listed correctly. How disruptive would all this be, the dance professor asked, and the cherub-faced blond contractor\\u2019s spokesman answered politely, \\u201cVery much so, ma\\u2019am.\\u201d Then the chemistry professor chimed in about particulates. If the entire brick fa\\u00e7ade was being torn off, what was being done about air-quality control? The chemistry professor had small children. Small children had small lungs. The blond man said that they would tape over everyone\\u2019s windows. They would tape over the vents of everyone\\u2019s A.C.s. \\u201cSo, no A.C.s or windows?\\u201d another professor asked. \\u201cAll through summer, no opening windows or running A.C.s?\\u201d This professor, who taught biology and kept on the building\\u2019s rooftop a colony of honeybees, was not known to repeat himself. The blond man said that that was correct. And that the rooftop would be closed to accommodate the rigging, so the bee colony would have to be moved.\\n\\nTo better address the concerns of the tenants, a second virtual meeting was called, and predictably it went much worse.\\n\\nThe third virtual meeting was cancelled, and, a day later, scaffolding went up. Spaghetti-like ropes encased the building, and men in orange vests carrying hammer drills appeared on skinny platform lifts. Windows were covered with a neon-blue film that turned every room into an aquarium and gave tenants headaches. \\u201cNo one\\u2019s complained about the blue film before,\\u201d the contractor said, though he then admitted to never having worked on an occupied building before. Clear film was procured four days later, the windows retaped.\\n\\nThe contractor did boast about having an on-site hygienist, a woman who was copied on e-mails but whom no one had met.\\n\\nFor three weeks, the noise level was terrible, from nine to five, Monday through Friday, with no pause. The new writing professor was trying to finish a novel but could only write things like \\u201cSo this is what it must feel like to live inside a tooth that a dentist is trying to drill.\\u201d The tooth occupied her thoughts nightly. She hadn\\u2019t gone to the dentist in years. Red dust coated the window film; plumes of smoke were seen. The religion professor brought up the plumes, how, from her red-tinted window, they seemed cloudlike even. The contractor replied immediately, copying the hygienist, to clarify that what the professor saw was not a plume or anything close to a cloud but a puff of smoke being aggrandized by the wind.\\n\\nEach morning, there was an e-mail update explaining which units would be most directly affected that day, though the apartment numbers were still incorrect. So, to figure out if you were truly going to be affected, you had to watch for where the huge mechanical pulley on the roof was dropping lifts. Glancing up at the building from the outside, the ceramics professor was reminded of his childhood, and that unwinnable arcade game with a bin of plush toys and a slippery claw. He was on the corner waiting for Mister Softee. He was waiting for Mister Softee because his three boys, who were inside, had told him to text them when the truck was in sight.\\n\\nThe technical term for what was missing was flashing\\u2014an embedded sheet of metal that prevents moisture from penetrating a building\\u2019s walls. Flashing is particularly important at junctions, around windows, vent pipes, etc. No one thought anymore of the word\\u2019s other meanings\\u2014committing indecent exposure, for example, running buck naked across a green field in a Superman cape, as the six-year-old son of the dance professor had done during his first soccer game.\\n\\nInclement weather set in one weekend, a hurricane muscling through from the south. Rain fell for three days and nights, and the history professor, whose apartment was right below the pulley, said it sounded as if it were raining within the walls. Could there be a leak? He sent the company an audio clip. The company responded a minute later. Leaks were impossible. They had sealed all the leaks because that was what they were here to do. Below the history professor lived a math professor, who all weekend had been collecting the water that had funnelled into her office through the ceiling. She used a one-gallon bucket, and she\\u2019d emptied the bucket into the bathtub five times. The math professor was married to the East Asian Studies professor. Not that ironically, the former was Asian and the latter white. Between gallons three and four, the former had drafted an angry e-mail to the school, but then stared at her unnuanced message. She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.\\n\\nOver text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured resident\\u2014an economics professor\\u2014to declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. He\\u2019d left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.\\n\\nWithin the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the project\\u2019s architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the building\\u2019s foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the company\\u2019s scope. They dealt only with fa\\u00e7ades. Another company did foundations.\\n\\nThe next weekend, another storm front came through. Seven gallons, the math professor counted. In the history professor\\u2019s bedroom, a paint bubble, the height and width of a man, appeared on the wall overnight. He poked the bubble, afraid that it might actually be a person, like his department chair, and was sprayed, drenched, in brown water.\\n\\nThe professors lamented in the laundry room. What kind of collective e-mail to send, and in what tone? A seven-hundred-word one was drafted, with bulleted questions for further discussion. The e-mail was edited down to three hundred words, then ballooned again to a thousand.\\n\\n\\u201cWe must withhold rent,\\u201d the ethics professor said\\u2014a thought that gave the non-activist professors palpitations.\\n\\nThe walls of the water-filled units now felt spongy, and eventually a two-hundred-word e-mail was sent, signed by all the untenured professors, and ending with the sentence \\u201cWe demand immediate action.\\u201d Within an hour, a fit young man arrived and handed everyone he met a business card. The card said that he was the vice-president of the company. The man noted the places where water was still seeping in. He said that there would likely be mold growth, and, should the mold be the color of soot, coal, or volcanic ash, they would need to call in the hygienist to culture it. Not all strains are toxic, he informed them. Some were perfectly O.K. In addition, he\\u2019d gone up to the roof and found no visible faults around the pulley system, so perhaps the leak was a pre\\u00ebxisting condition that had suddenly, coincidentally, got worse. \\u201cThings like this do happen,\\u201d he insisted, and added that, once the scaffolding was removed, the foundation would naturally rise up, against gravity, to its previous position. Then he tipped his hard hat at the professors and wished them a good day.\\n\\nSo construction went on unimpeded, and more storms came through, and more gallons were collected. Spores grew in the wet areas, none whose colors were quite right to be cultured. Rent was paid reliably; no more complaints were filed. In time, the professors all arrived at the same conclusion. Was the leak really that bad? On good days, it sounded like living next to a waterfall.

The construction reminds one professor of an unwinnable claw game from their childhood.\\n\\nInclement weather exposes the severity of the issue: the rain seeping into the walls makes it sound as if it is raining inside. Tenants collect water leaking from the ceilings, but again, the company insists that leaks are impossible. The math professor weighs whether to address this issue and starts a discussion about feminism with her husband, the East Asian Studies professor, who supports her but doesn't want to steps as a result of his privilege.\\n\\nThe professors try to take collective action by composing a lengthy email with a list of questions but struggle to reach a consensus. Feeling the pressure, the ethics professor suggests withholding rent, causing apprehension among the non-activist professors. Eventually, an email demanding immediate action is sent, which prompts the company's vice-president to visit promptly. He assures the professors that mold growth may occur and that the foundation will return to its normal position once the scaffolding is removed. The construction continues uninterrupted despite the ongoing leaks and storms.\\n\\nOver time, the professors' complaints dwindle, and they cast doubt on the severity of the leak, feeling reminiscent of their time in graduate school biding their time until they have tenure and more freedom.\\namp\", \"story_token_count\": 2183, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 415, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 532}, {\"Title\": \"Certain European Movies\", \"Author\": \"Emma Cline\", \"story\": \"They were trying to find the beach from the guidebook.\\nHe\\u2019d bought the guidebook at the train station, some dutiful gesture on his way to the residency, but hadn\\u2019t even opened it.\\nShe hadn\\u2019t known him then\\u2014when he bought the guidebook.

However, neither of them points out that they are at the wrong beach. The woman and the carefree couple strip down to sunbathe. The woman feels embarrassed when the man takes a photo of her naked.

Given six tries to guess a five-letter word, he is quicker to recall words without real vowels (she doesn\\u2019t support the idea that \\u201cY\\u201d is a vowel), and he has the nerve to guess words with triple letters, like \\u201cfluff,\\u201d on the second try. Of course, she knows what fluff is. It\\u2019s either bullshit or the stuffing that comes out of cheap toys. But it\\u2019s not a word she would have guessed.\\n\\nIn defense of \\u201cY\\u201d \\u2019s vowelness, he asks, What about \\u201clynx\\u201d?\\n\\nLynx? she replies, incredulous. When have you ever used that aloud? Oh, look, over there, that lynx is about to pounce and rip out my heart! She is certain that any person in such a scenario would use the word \\u201cbobcat.\\u201d\\n\\nWhat most infuriates her is the presumption that she must be a whiz at words given her vocation as a writer of books. She is gifted calendar crossword puzzles (yes, three hundred and sixty-five tiny crosswords, one sheet for each day) every December, and is often dragged into long bouts of Words with Friends. In one game, he scores more than seventy points with a well-placed \\u201cQ.\\u201d She loses that game soon enough and texts him, You\\u2019re always doing stuff like that, calculating the value of each word.

She calls into question these rules: is the point system for letters really based on frequency, or is it some larger institutional metric of mind control? He repeats, But those are the rules. On her darkest of writing days, she takes the last sentence she wrote and tallies it up for points. She is immensely disappointed. Then she stares at those crossword calendars, and they stare back. The five she was gifted this holiday season, plus several from last year. They sit all over her desk like blind cats. Hundreds if not thousands of empty squares.\\n\\nShe wonders why she is so bad at word games and has convinced herself that it\\u2019s because she knows too many words. Also, writers don\\u2019t like to be told what to write. A four-letter word for sleeveless garment, today\\u2019s crossword demands. But why is it \\u201ctank\\u201d and not \\u201cvest\\u201d?\\n\\nHis vocation is probably important: a computer scientist, a programmer, a coder. His work involves numbers and really simple words like \\u201cinput,\\u201d \\u201cprint,\\u201d or \\u201crun.\\u201d Coding also involves punctuation, which she is terrible at. An English teacher once asked her if she\\u2019d ever met a comma in her life. A comma after every fourth word is how she does it, regardless of what the word is (the answer to her teacher\\u2019s question being no), and thank God for copy editors. He is skilled with commas, semicolons, dashes, and slashes, and spends most of the workweek combing through code for a misplaced parenthesis that has misfired an array. Arrays are built into other arrays. Macros built into other macros.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t think I can write a sentence like that, she thinks. A sentence nestled into another, like whatever that turducken dish is, or, more simply, like an onion, the five-letter word she did not guess on the day it was the word to guess. Being the same on either side, the word \\u201conion\\u201d is an onion, the \\u201ci\\u201d bisecting it like a core. She texts him this amazing realization, only to thereby reveal the answer to the word game before he has had a chance to play. He texts back, Thanks, what unexpected luck.\\n\\nHe is also better at phrases, especially at guessing them when they are hidden behind white cubes. He was raised on \\u201cWheel of Fortune,\\u201d and, whenever they watch that program together, he shouts at the people inside the television, Why are you buying vowels? His favorite category is Before and After, or, to her, the category of nonsensical phrases. \\u201cNew baby buggy,\\u201d for instance. She keeps getting stuck on the chronology. Isn\\u2019t a baby by default new? And buggy, an outdated term for the first motorized vehicles with open tops? The Model T was a buggy, wasn\\u2019t it? So, on the time line of existence, an old car should come before a new baby. That\\u2019s not how any of this works, he replies. But, now that they\\u2019ve touched on the chicken-and-egg problem, they have to persist. She accepts that words came before the sentence, but argues that, in the same way calculus was invented to serve physics, words were created to construct sentences. The selection and sequence of words constitute meaning. The sentence is the final boss. After thinking that over, he says, But I like calculus, and she says, Which is fine. Great, even! There\\u2019s nothing wrong with calculus. She pats him on the arm.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s called having \\u201cthe last word,\\u201d not \\u201cthe last sentence.\\u201d So we can\\u2019t end there, with her patting him on the arm and going on and on about sentences. A piece of trivia dislodges in his brain: \\u201ccalculus\\u201d comes from the Latin for small pebble. Pebbles as used on an abacus, to count out money, votes, and distances. In medicine, the word is still used for a solid mass made from mineral salts that can form in organs or ducts. A kidney stone is a calculus. A kidney stone can cause great pain. In high school, everyone sat in metal chairs and had sore backs. Everyone groaned about calculus homework; everyone complained to the teacher, including him.

There were two women sitting at the table with Bo. Floretta was nudging Cloletha\\u2019s shoulder. Both were snapping their fingers to a jukebox song. Norman bought four beers and then sat down with them.\\n\\nIn Chicasetta, time hadn\\u2019t so much passed as crept out Norman\\u2019s back door. He and Barbara-Pam had grown up together in the same church and had attended the same segregated schools. Barbara-Pam\\u2019s mama was a widow, but, when men tried to court her, she\\u2019d tell them she\\u2019d had herself a good love. She didn\\u2019t need nary other. And Barbara-Pam wanted that kind of man, like her daddy had been to her mama.\\n\\nShe\\u2019d caught Norman\\u2019s eye when he was sixteen. He was good-looking, muscular, and knew it. Bo was his ace and full of laughter until he got called up to Vietnam, after graduation. But nineteen was still just an idea that year, and those boys walked the halls of the Negro high school like they were kings in a land where dark skin equalled royalty.\\n\\nBarbara-Pam was pretty back in high school, but so was Floretta. Or maybe Floretta was just all right. Who knew? You couldn\\u2019t take your eyes off them big legs, and, if you tried to lift your gaze, there was that nice, round behind. Floretta\\u2019s mama was a widow, too, of a sort. The man who\\u2019d gotten her pregnant had gone to the electric chair. She insisted they\\u2019d been headed to the altar, but couldn\\u2019t nobody verify that story. The mother and daughter went to church at Mt. Calvary, where the siddity Negroes worshipped and sang true hymns, instead of lining-out spirituals.\\n\\nThe tension between what Floretta promised behind the high school and what Barbara-Pam pretended she didn\\u2019t know existed had eventually made the choice for Norman. But Barbara-Pam\\u2019s shyness gave way two years after they were married. She climbed on top of him, and he found he was disappointed in her pleasure. She was not as pristine as he\\u2019d thought. She\\u2019d simply been ignorant.\\n\\nThe years abandoned Norman. He was in his thirties, past his Jesus year. He was a deacon at his and Barbara-Pam\\u2019s church, where his father had served in the same pious role. When Norman opened the back door of his house, no unexpected tremors greeted him. Barbara-Pam rolled up her hair at night with pink curlers and wore flowered housedresses that reminded Norman of his own mama, an antidote to any man\\u2019s rising nature.\\n\\nThat night at the Legion, Norman put the beers down on the table, but Bo and Cloletha rose and left, holding hands. Floretta didn\\u2019t even look toward the door where the two had departed. She swayed in her seat and mouthed the words along to \\u201cWoman to Woman.\\u201d She told Norman that this was her song.\\n\\nEverybody in town knew that Bo was married and didn\\u2019t have no business with Cloletha, but Bo was Norman\\u2019s best friend. Bo had changed and gone quiet after coming back from the war. Still, an ace was for life. You had to stay with him, or else what was honor? Wasn\\u2019t that the meaning of a friendship stronger than the bones that held your gore and spirit? Norman told himself that he was only sitting at the table to wait for Bo. That was all he intended.\\n\\nBut word travelled to Barbara-Pam that Floretta had slid onto the seat of her husband\\u2019s pickup, and they\\u2019d driven off into the dark. When Norman opened his front door, Barbara-Pam was waiting. She was tired, she said. Didn\\u2019t nothing seem to make him happy no more. He had a good, faithful woman and two little girls who were crazy about him, but he didn\\u2019t seem to care. She ordered him out, though the house was in his name.\\n\\nGiven the expense of divorce, he figured it was cheaper to keep Barbara-Pam, but he started living with Floretta full time. After a few years of private remonstrations from his minister, and his mama refusing to let him attend Sunday dinners at her house, which was only a few yards across the field from his technical dwelling, Norman compromised: he began spending a couple of nights a week with Barbara-Pam.\\n\\nHe got to thinking that all things were possible, like when he\\u2019d walked the halls of Chicasetta Colored High School. Like he was a man across the ocean in Africa, one who had a right to more than one wife. Whenever Barbara-Pam started in with her nagging, he\\u2019d remind her: Don\\u2019t get too feisty. Surprisingly, however, the loving had returned with Barbara-Pam. He began to enjoy it when she climbed on top. Also, there was the smothered cube steak she made for him on alternate Saturday nights.\\n\\nThen Floretta\\u2019s baby boy came, and she started giving Norman a settling-down eye, and he decided Barbara-Pam was his choice. They had made vows in front of a preacher, it didn\\u2019t make no sense to keep bouncing back and forth, and, truth be told, Norman just couldn\\u2019t keep up no more. Their little boy had been walking for a month the Friday he packed the things he kept at Floretta\\u2019s place, but she didn\\u2019t cry. She told him, \\u201cJust \\u2019cause the cock crow, don\\u2019t make the sun rise.\\u201d He thought about that for more days than he cared to admit, but he never could parse it through.\\n\\nThe Sunday morning after their true reconciliation, Norman reached for his wife, but she wasn\\u2019t in bed. He smelled sausage cooking: church mornings weren\\u2019t the same if there wasn\\u2019t pork on the table, and he sure hoped there were biscuits and grits as well. He quickly showered, dried off, then went to the closet, where he found that Barbara-Pam had splattered his deacon\\u2019s suits with bleach. Even his pride and joy, the maroon one with pointy-toed gaiters to match. Somehow, he\\u2019d been sound asleep while his woman had done this.\\n\\nIt took Norman two months to save enough for new church suits, and he was too old-fashioned to wear work clothes to Sunday services. On those heathen days, he\\u2019d drive to his old high school, which was now integrated. Not only law but custom had finally changed, and Norman didn\\u2019t even recognize the place. On school days, there were no loud boasts from boys, no girls fanning their bottoms. He sat in his truck and listened to the radio until he had to turn it off to save the battery. The paved parking lot wasn\\u2019t the dusty strip that had been there in Norman\\u2019s prime, in the right-handed kingdom of years past.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Norman is a middle-aged man living in a small town called Chicasetta. He is married to Barbara-Pam, a woman he grew up with, and they have two children together.

He chose Barbara-Pam, but over the years, their relationship deteriorated. Barbara-Pam was initially shy and inexperienced, but once they got married, Norman realized she was not as \\\"pristine\\\" as he thought.\\n\\nNorman and Barbara-Pam's marriage became strained, and Norman found solace in Floretta's company. He started spending more time with her, despite her being aware that he was married. Eventually, Barbara-Pam found out about their affair and kicked Norman out of their home.\\n\\nNorman started living with Floretta full-time, but faced criticism from his minister and his own mother. He decided to compromise and spend a couple of nights a week with Barbara-Pam instead. During this time, Norman began to enjoy his relationship with Barbara-Pam again, but also felt pressure from Floretta to fully commit to her.\\n\\nFinally, Norman decided to choose Barbara-Pam over Floretta and moved back in with her. They rekindled their relationship, but the peace was short-lived. One Sunday morning, Norman woke up to find that Barbara-Pam had bleached all his deacon suits out of anger.

It was difficult to understand exactly how the Jewish people had got on Anatoly\\u2019s bad side. Maybe Moses hadn\\u2019t been polite when asking Anatoly\\u2019s ancestors for directions to the promised land? Still, although Anatoly was filled with burning hatred for Jews, he didn\\u2019t admit his guilt in an assassination attempt. It wasn\\u2019t so much his conviction that upset him as the fact that he wasn\\u2019t put in a high-security prison, where, Anatoly believed, the real terrorists went. Terrorism, as a rule, is considered a serious crime that could earn you a strict sentence of life imprisonment, but for some reason the court decided to take pity on Anatoly. Either the criminal, in the court\\u2019s opinion, was not dangerous or the evidence was inconclusive. Or maybe the leniency was due to the fact that, as the state of Israel apparently noted in black and white in the accusation against him, there were no victims, no damage, and no claims.\\n\\nAnatoly had been outed to the special services by a friend, who told them that Anatoly was planning to blow up the Israeli Embassy and its Ambassador and had invited him to participate in this exciting event. The friend also handed over some explosives and a flash drive with recordings of his conversations with Anatoly. Anatoly was arrested. He did not confess. The investigators checked the explosives for prints. There were some, but they belonged to Anatoly\\u2019s comrade, not him. The investigators listened to the conversations on the flash drive and discerned some indistinct muttering that led them to make broad conclusions about Anatoly\\u2019s fantasies, but there was nothing about preparing for an explosion. The only substantial evidence was his friend\\u2019s testimony, although the friendship was unlikely to survive such a turn of events. In court, Anatoly pleaded not guilty but delivered a fiery speech about the threat of Zionism to the world. The judge gave him a seven-year sentence because you never knew what could happen.\\n\\nAnatoly was well over fifty. He had a wife and three boys. After the arrest, the youngest son, who was seven, waited a long time for his father to return from his business trip. He watched the news on TV, wishing for a quick end to the war in Donbas, which he believed was the reason his father could not come home\\u2014because it had stopped the trains from running. As usually happens with these sorts of cases, it was difficult to find the extremist. The judge is sure that the investigators wouldn\\u2019t just accuse anyone they come across, especially if the evidence is weak or nonexistent. The investigators work with the material that the field operatives have dug up, conferring on it an almost divine quality. The field operatives seize on any excuse to inflate the importance and existential necessity of their team. And this is how cases involving guys like Anatoly multiply all over Russia, while security forces receive orders and titles, TV channels scare their viewers with talk of terrorists, and the people shudder a little but then sigh in gratitude that such vigilant special-services officers are there to protect them. No one cares that, somewhere, a little boy waits for the trains to bring his father home from a business trip. Such is the state\\u2019s ruthless, repressive machine, which grinds up people\\u2019s futures. Well, at least the Putin regime has not yet resorted to mass executions\\u2014unlike the Stalinist one, when people disappeared into the unknown by the millions. Things were done quietly and in secret then, and everyone tiptoed in fear. Today\\u2019s Russia prefers show trials, to make people terrified of becoming one of those highly publicized examples.\\n\\nAnatoly was of medium height, lean, and athletic for his age. He aimed to go to bed early, before lights-out if possible. To insure a good night\\u2019s sleep, he\\u2019d plug his ears with red paraffin wax that he had scraped from cheese rinds. He also wore a homemade black eye mask to block out any interference from the duty light. In this state of sensory deprivation, he\\u2019d set off to visit Morpheus. In the morning, he rose long before sunrise. Having unsealed his ears and removed his Zorro mask, he washed with cold water at the sink and began his yoga. Each new cellmate, upon waking, was horrified to see the life-threatening positions into which Uncle Tolya contorted himself, and rushed to save him. But there was no need for help: Anatoly unfurled himself independently. During his exercise time in the prison yard, he demonstrated how good he felt, raising his hands and greeting the sun with barely audible whispers, then racing around the cramped courtyard, practically running on the walls. When he was drenched with sweat, he would pause, still not out of breath, put on a special hat with a paper ball tied to it with string, and begin boxing furiously. Anatoly was a master of such homemade devices, and this was one of his most impressive. Even the guards, who had seen a lot in their lifetimes, would stop and watch from above, captivated, as Anatoly\\u2019s ball twirled around. He did little actual boxing, but, judging by the way he relentlessly attacked and defended himself from the ubiquitous ball, it was clear that he had his own unique style.\\n\\nAnatoly didn\\u2019t smoke or have any vices, but he found a unique use for matches. He would burn bread crusts, using them to light or fumigate corners, and even creating fire circles in harmless Zoroastrian rituals. Anatoly was also studying Farsi\\u2014an interest perhaps born of his desire to check the Ayatollah Khomeini Telegram channel for the celebratory news that the Israeli Embassy had been bombed. His progress was slow, but, as Anatoly himself would say, \\u201cThe language is several thousand years old,\\u201d so he was in no rush.\\n\\nIn many ways, Anatoly was a fairly typical inmate, but, as soon as the conversation shifted to the Jewish question, particularly when he himself redirected it there, his cell was filled with visions of Jewish Freemasons who controlled the world, weaving intricate plots and schemes with long-range goals beyond mere mortals\\u2019 comprehension. The main question for Anatoly was: How can we fight all this? And the first answer that came to his mind involved explosives.\\n\\nAnatoly was a seasoned ideological combatant, well versed not only in the so-called Jewish world conspiracy but in the intricacies of Putin\\u2019s regime. For many years, he\\u2019d followed a crazy colonel who intended to overthrow Putin with the help of a couple of divisions that were loyal to him, plus tanks, submarine mini-boats in the Moscow River, and volunteers like Anatoly in a paramilitary organization named after Minin and Pozharsky. The uprising failed: either the tanks didn\\u2019t arrive on schedule or the submarines surfaced in the wrong place. The colonel was imprisoned for a long time, but he continued to direct appeals to his supporters and shower curses on the heads of his enemies.\\n\\nIn his youth, Anatoly had served in Soviet military intelligence. He was sent to Afghanistan as part of a newly formed Muslim battalion. He did not take part in the Tajbeg Palace assault, but he performed other feats to protect the interests of the Soviet Union in a distant and barren land. Anatoly talked a lot about his service, the exhausting training, the long marches in full gear in a-hundred-and-four-degree heat, his stupid fellow-soldiers, the local life, the war. He described how he had interrogated silent mujahideen fighters by inserting an explosive with a Bickford fuse into their ears. While the fuse was burning, the gift of speech usually returned. The stoic ones had half their heads blown off. Every war has its laws, none of which can be called entirely fair. Anatoly did not like to describe what the mujahideen did to the Soviet soldiers they captured.\\n\\nHe sincerely hated Putin for many reasons, including his attack on Ukraine, a country that Anatoly loved with all his heart and whose fate he now worried about from afar. It was not only because his wife was from there, or because they took a train there for a visit every summer, or because of the delicious food or the good people, and definitely not because of the freedom there after the Maidan Revolution, which he could not appreciate, sitting in his cramped cell. He loved Ukraine because it was dearer to him than his own, criminal country.\\n\\nOnce Anatoly had received his sentence but had not yet been sent to the prison camp, he was allowed a short meeting with his wife in a booth where they were separated by a pane of glass. He returned, pale, to his cell, sat on the bed, and stared at the wall. Two of his best friends, former colleagues, had gone to Donbas to fight for Ukraine and had been burned alive in a damaged Kamaz truck. Anatoly spoke, as if to himself: \\u201cAnd my wife, silly woman, came all dressed up and happy. She says, \\u2018It\\u2019s good you\\u2019re in prison, you old fool. Otherwise, you would have gone with them.\\u2019 \\u201d Anatoly couldn\\u2019t contain himself and started to cry. That evening, he burned even more matches than usual.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Anatoly, a middle-aged man, has been sentenced to seven years in a medium-security prison for planning to blow up the Israeli Embassy and its Ambassador. He harbors intense hatred towards Jews but denies his involvement in the assassination attempt. Anatoly is disappointed that he wasn't sent to a high-security prison, believing that's where the \\\"real terrorists\\\" are. The court gave him a lenient sentence due to inconclusive evidence and the lack of victims or damage.\\n\\nBefore his arrest, Anatoly's friend had reported him to the special services, providing them with explosives and recordings of their conversations. However, the evidence mostly consisted of Anatoly's friend's testimony, which strained their friendship. Anatoly maintains his innocence and delivers a passionate speech about the threat of Zionism in court. Despite his fiery speech, the judge still sentences him to seven years, citing uncertainty about Anatoly's potential actions.\\n\\nAnatoly has a wife and three sons, and his youngest son, believing his father is away on a business trip, waits for his return, attributing his absence to the ongoing war in Donbas. The story highlights how cases like Anatoly's are common in Russia, where investigators rely on weak or nonexistent evidence, leading to unjust convictions. The state's repressive machine disregards the impact on families and individuals, focusing more on their own agenda.\\n\\nIn prison, Anatoly establishes a routine to ensure a good night's sleep. He practices yoga, running, and boxing in the prison yard, impressing both inmates and guards with his athleticism. Anatoly also uses matches for various purposes, such as burning bread crusts or conducting Zoroastrian rituals. He is studying Farsi, possibly to check for news of the Israeli Embassy bombing.\\n\\nAnatoly's beliefs about Jewish conspiracies and his involvement in paramilitary organizations reveal his deeply-rooted ideological extremism. He despises Putin's regime and passionately supports the Ukrainian cause due to his wife's background and experiences in the country. Anatoly's pain is intensified when two of his friends die tragically during the conflict.\\n\\nThe story portrays Anatoly as a complex character with conflicting beliefs and a strong sense of justice.

Despite his hatred for Jews, Anatoly maintains his innocence and views his sentence as a result of the court's leniency, believing he should have been in a high-security prison with \\\"real terrorists.\\\"\\n\\nThe story backtracks to how Anatoly was caught - a friend tipped off the special services about Anastoly's plan and provided them with some explosives and recordings of their conversations. Anatoly was arrested, but evidence against him was inconclusive, with his fingerprints being absent from the explosives and the conversations on the flash drive revealing more fantasies than any concrete plan. The only substantial evidence was the testimony of Anatoly's now-former friend.\\n\\nAnatoly reflects on his life before imprisonment, focusing especially on his family. He has a wife and three sons, and his youngest son believes that his father is unable to return home due to a war in Donbas disrupting train services. The narrative shifts towards criticizing the repressive nature of the Russian state and its focus on show trials and protecting its citizens through harsh security measures.\\n\\nAnatoly's daily routines in prison are described, featuring his attempts at a good night's sleep, morning yoga sessions, and intense exercise in the prison yard where he impresses both fellow inmates and guards. Meanwhile, he finds solace by speaking out against Jews, buying into conspiracy theories surrounding their control over the world and secretive plots and schemes. Anatoly believes in using explosives as a means to fight against Jewish influence.\\n\\nIt is revealed that Anatoly adheres to extreme ideologies against Jews and Putin's regime. He follows a colonel who aspired to overthrow Putin but failed, and Anatoly describes his own involvement with Soviet military intelligence during his youth in Afghanistan. Despite hating Putin, Anatoly exalts the virtues of Ukraine, even comparing it favorably with his own \\\"criminal\\\" country, Russia.\\n\\nThe story closes with an emotional scene where Anatoly meets his wife briefly before being sent to a prison camp, only to learn that two of his closest friends had died in Donbas. Devastated, Anatoly breaks down and burns an excessive amount of matches that evening, displaying his deep emotional turmoil.\", \"story_token_count\": 2218, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 601, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 551}, {\"Title\": \"Wolves\", \"Author\": \"Sterling HolyWhiteMountain\", \"story\": \"You won\\u2019t understand this. Me and my cousin were trying to learn the language, but there were . . . issues. Some people were with us, and some were against us. The former said anyone who wanted to learn should learn, we didn\\u2019t have time to waste, our mother tongue was dying. The others, they said we had too much white blood, we were not dark enough, we acted like we were too good for them! Man. Indian Country. The old guy said that long ago the people were pitiful and it was the wolves that showed us how to live with one another. The vision was one of compassion and order and beauty so fierce I could not grasp it. He told us the word for wolf. Mako\\u2019iyii. The old people, the ones who spoke the language, they had an interesting way of saying things. Even though they talked English, you could tell some other part of them was talking another language at the same time, one I should know, but don\\u2019t. I guess that\\u2019s just how things worked out, isn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nThe guy we were talking to, he was one of those old people who always wore a hat. My gram used to wear this bright-yellow broad-brimmed affair of woven straw. You could see her from way off, walking with her cane, and, if you went up to her, no matter how long it had been, she would demand a hug, and she was much stronger than you expected. It was like this. One old guy, he wore these glasses. I don\\u2019t know where he got them, they might have been the only pair of their kind on earth. This one time I saw him without them. For a second, I had no idea who he was. It\\u2019s not a hat, but you know what I\\u2019m saying. Those old people, they\\u2019re all gone now. I felt a freedom then, when I was at home and the mountains were there and the indescribable plains were there and the sunsets cast a light so serene over the land\\u2014you could think for a moment that everything was O.K. Sometimes, though, at night, I would wake in a proverbial cold sweat, and it seemed I had heard this howling sound, like the way wind sounds as it runs down and through a narrow canyon.\\n\\nThe old guy wore a black cowboy hat, and his face was dark brown and narrow with a long nose and heavy eyelids, and his lips were so dark they took on a purple hue, and he wore black sunglasses even indoors. You had this sense of import when you were around him, he was a line of dark energy running through a room. That\\u2019s how the truth feels. But there was this eagle feather in the hat band, and it was too big, it was obscene somehow, but seeing it made you smile. He might have been a cartoon, but then you talked to him and you understood why there was no in-between with him, people loved him or hated him. His hands were big and heavy-seeming and scarred, and he was always clasping them on the table in front of him. You could not look away. Like a lot of men his age, he had been a street fighter when he was young and even when he smiled there was a threat in it. The three of us usually talked at the casino, and the ones who were against us would see us, and they hated it because there was nothing they could say with him around. They didn\\u2019t know the language at all, or what they did know they mutilated like someone standing at a butcher\\u2019s block holding a cleaver for the first time. He was generous to their faces and laughed at them when they were gone.\\n\\nMe and my cousin, we spent a lot of time with him, and learned about the old ways and how you might think about things now. There was a lot of talk, how things could be if only x and y. In the end, what I learned is that a language is a way of seeing, and there is almost no way to see in the old way now. Because of the feather, his appearance from a distance was jaunty, a word that has never been used to describe people where I am from. One time we asked him about this idea of indian blood and how we might talk about it in the language, and he thought for a while. He ran the pointer and middle fingers of one hand down the inside of the other forearm\\u2014strange how soft the inside of an arm is, you could cut a person wide open\\u2014and he said this phrase in the language. I can\\u2019t remember it anymore. He told us it meant the government was watching our blood. I felt again the colossal thing looming over us all. I guess you might call it history, but that\\u2019s not quite the word, is it. I wanted to throttle the thing with my bare hands, but the past is immune to even our most desperate aggressions and, anyway, I am not the type. The old guy\\u2019s last name was Wolf Striker. Or that\\u2019s how you say it in English. Sometimes when I was alone at night I would say it in the language\\u2014Mako\\u2019iyawakkii\\u2014and imagine myself in the same place but a very different time.\\n\\nListen to me for once. Here is how it works. You look at a thing, and then you look at something else, and when you look back the first thing is different somehow. A value makes its shape known only to the corner of your eye. One day I looked away from the old guy, and when I looked back it was his funeral. I got a call from my uncle. I had gone back to school, I was in a study carrel, reading a text on Indigenous plant medicines written by a professor from Sweden. I was broke, but my auntie gave me gas money to go home. The funeral was one of those things you may not see again. The priest had tried to come in, and there was a fight in front of the building where the bodies are put out, because the old guy had said there should be no priest. I knew why he said it, and I knew that I would say the same whenever my time was near. The church has had us in a choke hold for a long time now. Someone had one-punched Father Allen and laid him out flat on the sidewalk, and then another guy stepped in and really put the boots to him. You knew it was a story that would never go away, that cocksucker on the ground with his broken glasses, crying out, Please God! Inside, the old guy\\u2019s body was in the casket, and his arms were crossed over his chest, and his best boots, the black ones with the embroidered flowers, were on his feet, and the black cowboy hat was off to one side but the feather was missing. Some of the people who were against us were at the funeral, and they said how sorry they were he was gone they were so sorry they had never been this sorry. He was the last great speaker of our language, etc. I watched them go one by one to the mike near the casket, and while they spoke I invited my most murderous thoughts to join me. Then I dropped out of college. Phone calls, e-mails, letters came, even a text. (Hi K____! Your absence from Twentieth-Century U.S. History is noticeable. . . .) I ignored them all. There was nothing left in me. I told family and relatives the things he had taught me and my cousin. This idea of indian blood, I said, half this and a quarter that. It\\u2019s just more white-man bullshit. This isn\\u2019t our way! But no one cared. One of my cousins listened for a while and then bummed a twenty spot. When I went back to school the next year, I don\\u2019t know. There was this white girl in my tribal-sovereignty course. I tried to talk indian law with her, but she just wanted to talk traditional foods. One night she offered profound and considered commentary on the situation. You look white to me, she said. After that I thought often about taking her back to the reservation. We would go to Big Bear Alley, where everyone who lives on the street sleeps in the summer. I would say, This one here and that one there and this one over here who looks sorta like me\\u2014these are my relatives. Is that authentic enough, I would say. Does that meet your criteria, you fucking bitch.\\n\\nThe dreams came back for a while. I dropped out for good. Things really do end. Sometimes, when there is no moon and the soft starry arc of the mako\\u2019iyo\\u201dso\\u2019koi is cast across the sky like a mother\\u2019s arms and I cannot sleep, I drive to a spot on the flats where you can hear the wolves. I roll down my window and listen. They come sleek and systematic and regal down from the mountains and through the canyons, and some of them howl while the others assert themselves over the coyotes and ranch dogs who yelp and cry out in the dark. You would not believe the sound. In my head I can still hear his voice. Out on the flats it is an absolute slaughter.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story revolves around the narrator and their cousin's attempt to learn their indigenous language, despite facing opposition from some people in their community who believe they are not \\\"dark enough\\\" or that they act superior.

Blue Island was within walking distance of the Ashland Avenue bridge, which spanned the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. It was a walk that Romy took from sixth grade on. He\\u2019d imagine that he was running away from home, escaping down a river like Huckleberry Finn, or going to live in secret like a hermit in one of the deserted little bridge-tender houses. He never tired of seeing the street split open as the bridge lifted its asphalt arms to the sky. He loved watching the rusty barges, heaped with demolished cars, floating by on river time, while street traffic waited, jammed bumper to bumper. At night, eruptions of acetylene-blue sparks and furnaces flaring behind charred foundry windows coated the oily water with visions of hellfire. But, even as a kid, Romy sensed that, if a toxic river flowing backward as it carried out the city\\u2019s sewage could enthrall him, then he needed to see the ocean as soon as possible.\\n\\nThe Navy taught him to box. When his tour of duty was over, he moved back to Chicago to fight in the annual Golden Gloves tournament, and made it to the welterweight finals. Romy wasn\\u2019t my godfather, but, given that we\\u2019d grown up in different generations in the same neighborhood, and were both southpaw welterweights, he appointed himself my guardian angel. That required him to teach me to box, or at least to try, which he did until I was able to convince him that getting repeatedly hit in the mouth was ruining my embouchure for the clarinet.\\n\\nHe also advised me in matters of the heart.\\n\\nHis advice for getting back with a girl you couldn\\u2019t forget was to call her out of the blue. Timing was important. It had to be in the evening, but early enough that you hadn\\u2019t lost the light. When she answered\\u2014if she answered\\u2014you\\u2019d say, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go walking.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd, whatever you do, skip the sad-ass Hi . . . it\\u2019s me moment, followed by a melodramatic pause, like you got some special status as me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat if she asks where to?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere what?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIs this something you\\u2019ve done yourself?\\u201d I asked him.

You need to stick to now,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou been out of touch so long, and suddenly silence has been broken, but you\\u2019re worried what next and want a backup plan, right?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt was just a simple question.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cRight.

I know this taqueria on Twenty-sixth that features an assembly-line-like contraption that makes fresh corn tortillas. A sign claims that in the whole world only two such machines exist, one in Mexico City and the other here in Chicago. It reminds me of a similar setup I saw at the Caf\\u00e9 du Monde in New Orleans, where they make fresh beignets no matter the time of night.\\n\\nBut we have wandered into a part of the city where neither of us has been before, even though it feels familiar. There\\u2019s a saline smell of pilings that you might expect in a maritime city like New Orleans, but not in Chicago.\\n\\n\\u201cMaybe you were here once as a kid,\\u201d she says, \\u201cback when you\\u2019d pedal around for hours on that red Sears bike, trying to get lost.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIf I was here before, it was in another life.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou believe in past lives?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBelieve? No. Even though sometimes it feels like it could be true.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s due to all the different lives we live during the one we think we have.\\u201d\\n\\nWe stop at the center of a bridge spanning the river and look down at a sheet of ice so thin that we can see the shapes of swimming fish below it. Carp, maybe, or catfish, bottom-feeders the ice has brought to the surface. The gulls see them, too, and dip past us, swirling and skimming over the frosted shadows just out of reach.\\n\\n\\u201cWho knew there were still so many fish,\\u201d she says. \\u201cDidn\\u2019t this river once catch on fire?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re not fish you\\u2019d want to eat, unless one of your other lives was as a gull.\\u201d\\n\\nThe bridge crosses into blocks of deserted streets grooved by railroad tracks and lined with shuttered warehouses.

When it opens, she isn\\u2019t the least surprised. We glance around to be sure that no one is watching and push inside.\\n\\nI expect it to be dark, but the tile floors gleam at the mouths of corridors, and a shaft of light suspending dust as if it were photons streams down the stairs.

Know what I mean?\\u201d she asks.\\n\\nWe climb three flights and turn down a corridor that\\u2019s lined with chipped, cream-colored radiators. A bank of wired-glass windows gleams above them. Like the river, the windows are sheathed in a pane of ice. It has patched over all the cracked and broken places that shine a coppery pink through the frost, like wounds through gauze. Dusk shoots like laser beams through the bullet holes. The track of a push broom on the floor has shaped a tiny dune of shattered glass mottled with flakes of lead paint and bird droppings.

I\\u2019d never thought that I would teach high-school Latin, although I was equipped to do so. As for the substitution: they didn\\u2019t explain if the teacher I was stepping in for was sick or had died or been fired; his absence sounded more like a time-out. It was not only time that seemed frozen; the school did, too. Something had sucked the air out of that place: at school functions, students did not breathe, and the teachers\\u2019 lounge featured enormous portraits of illustrious rectors, plus a gigantic one of a major naval battle. The teachers\\u2019 lounge was dark, as were the courtyards, and in those places I would sense disapproving looks aimed in my direction.\\n\\nThere was surely a modern methodology for teaching Latin, but that place prevented me from making any plans. I would go in terrified and feel calm again only once I was at least two blocks away. I felt that everything I did was wrong; my fear was a kind of animal fear, and I was just relieved that they didn\\u2019t beat me or lock me inside.\\n\\nThe school has always been a nest for fledgling leaders, dissidents, and success stories, but, at thirteen and fourteen years old, those kids were punished for any little thing; a security guard, who was said to work for the police, did not allow them to go to the bathroom during classroom hours, no exceptions. Those were the conditions I had to work in, and teaching Latin no less. The sentences my students translated went like this:\\n\\n    The slave prepares a dinner of roasted eel for the lady.\\n    The dog must be obedient to his owner, the child to his parents.\\n    Young lady, put on the light-blue toga to honor our goddess.\\n    Caesar advances forty-five parasangs with his Army.\\n\\nHow far is a \\u201cparasang\\u201d? Whom could I ask?\\n\\n    Young lady, you must put flowers on the goddess\\u2019s altar and cinnabar on Janus\\u2019.\\n\\nWhat might \\u201ccinnabar\\u201d be? The students were going to fuck with me by asking, but neither I nor they actually wanted to know. Having made a fool of myself, I would leave the school still not knowing such things, and if, as I expected, some punishment were to be inflicted upon me, at least I would know the reason. The texts used such restrictive and cruel language; it was always an order, a demand, an altar for some goddess. But the passage I hated most was the one by Arria, the matron who, with great conviction, told her sick husband in one room that their son, who had died in another, was getting better and had eaten a hearty meal.\\n\\nSince I taught Latin class from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M., I would lighten the mood by teaching Roman culture in the second hour and describing what the Romans ate.\\n\\nOne thing I always found odd about Roman cuisine was that one creature was cooked inside another. For example, you might find a goose inside a pig, and, inside the goose, a little chicken, all of this smeared in honey, the glue that kept it together.\\n\\nI would say to my students, \\u201cHow interesting!\\u201d\\n\\nAnd they would reply, \\u201cDisgusting! Why are you telling us this\\u2014and right at noon!\\u201d\\n\\nI also taught them that, in ancient Rome, people would toss everything in the streets\\u2014piss and all the rest. The lesson generated such an uproar that I wasn\\u2019t able to contain it. I was saved by the bell, but the security guard who was with the police still came in and stared at me. I fled to a caf\\u00e9 that was about five blocks away and not on my regular route; I wandered around like a lost puppy. When I sat down, the caf\\u00e9 seemed extraordinary to me, the street like a sanctuary, and the waiter a prince.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The narrator reluctantly takes on a position as a substitute Latin teacher at the National School of Buenos Aires, an elite preparatory school.

The people of the village began to gather in the square, between the post office and the bank, around ten o\\u2019clock; in some towns there were so many people that the lottery took two days and had to be started on June 26th, but in this village, where there were only about three hundred people, the whole lottery took only about two hours, so it could begin at ten o\\u2019clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner.\\n\\nThe children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous play, and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix\\u2014the villagers pronounced this name \\u201cDellacroy\\u201d\\u2014eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at the boys, and the very small children rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.\\n\\nSoon the men began to gather, surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother\\u2019s grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother.\\n\\nThe lottery was conducted\\u2014as were the square dances, the teen-age club, the Halloween program\\u2014by Mr. Summers, who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him, because he had no children and his wife was a scold. When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called, \\u201cLittle late today, folks.\\u201d The postmaster, Mr. Graves, followed him, carrying a three-legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between themselves and the stool, and when Mr. Summers said, \\u201cSome of you fellows want to give me a hand?,\\u201d there was a hesitation before two men, Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers inside it.\\n\\nThe original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box now resting on the stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest man in town, was born. Mr. Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box, but no one liked to upset even as much tradition as was represented by the black box. There was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down to make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking again about a new box, but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything\\u2019s being done. The black box grew shabbier each year; by now it was no longer completely black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in some places faded or stained.\\n\\nMr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, held the black box securely on the stool until Mr. Summers had stirred the papers thoroughly with his hand. Because so much of the ritual had been forgotten or discarded, Mr. Summers had been successful in having slips of paper substituted for the chips of wood that had been used for generations. Chips of wood, Mr. Summers had argued, had been all very well when the village was tiny, but now that the population was more than three hundred and likely to keep on growing, it was necessary to use something that would fit more easily into the black box. The night before the lottery, Mr. Summers and Mr. Graves made up the slips of paper and put them into the box, and it was then taken to the safe of Mr. Summers\\u2019 coal company and locked up until Mr. Summers was ready to take it to the square next morning. The rest of the year, the box was put away, sometimes one place, sometimes another; it had spent one year in Mr. Graves\\u2019 barn and another year underfoot in the post office, and sometimes it was set on a shelf in the Martin grocery and left there.\\n\\nThere was a great deal of fussing to be done before Mr. Summers declared the lottery open. There were the lists to make up\\u2014of heads of families, heads of households in each family, members of each household in each family. There was the proper swearing-in of Mr. Summers by the postmaster, as the official of the lottery; at one time, some people remembered, there had been a recital of some sort, performed by the official of the lottery, a perfunctory, tuneless chant that had been rattled off duly each year; some people believed that the official of the lottery used to stand just so when he said or sang it, others believed that he was supposed to walk among the people, but years and years ago this part of the ritual had been allowed to lapse. There had been, also, a ritual salute, which the official of the lottery had had to use in addressing each person who came up to draw from the box, but this also had changed with time, until now it was felt necessary only for the official to speak to each person approaching. Mr. Summers was very good at all this; in his clean white shirt and blue jeans, with one hand resting carelessly on the black box, he seemed very proper and important as he talked interminably to Mr. Graves and the Martins.\\n\\nJust as Mr. Summers finally left off talking and turned to the assembled villagers, Mrs. Hutchinson came hurriedly along the path to the square, her sweater thrown over her shoulders, and slid into place in the back of the crowd. \\u201cClean forgot what day it was,\\u201d she said to Mrs. Delacroix, who stood next to her, and they both laughed softly. \\u201cThought my old man was out back stacking wood,\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson went on, \\u201cand then I looked out the window and the kids was gone, and then I remembered it was the twenty-seventh and came a-running.\\u201d She dried her hands on her apron, and Mrs. Delacroix said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re in time, though. They\\u2019re still talking away up there.\\u201d\\n\\nMrs. Hutchinson craned her neck to see through the crowd and found her husband and children standing near the front. She tapped Mrs. Delacroix on the arm as a farewell and began to make her way through the crowd. The people separated good-humoredly to let her through; two or three people said, in voices just loud enough to be heard across the crowd, \\u201cHere comes your Mrs., Hutchinson,\\u201d and \\u201cBill, she made it after all.\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson reached her husband, and Mr. Summers, who had been waiting, said cheerfully, \\u201cThought we were going to have to get on without you, Tessie.\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson said, grinning, \\u201cWouldn\\u2019t have me leave m\\u2019dishes in the sink, now, would you, Joe?,\\u201d and soft laughter ran through the crowd as the people stirred back into position after Mrs. Hutchinson\\u2019s arrival.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, now,\\u201d Mr. Summers said soberly, \\u201cguess we better get started, get this over with, so\\u2019s we can go back to work. Anybody ain\\u2019t here?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDunbar,\\u201d several people said. \\u201cDunbar, Dunbar.\\u201d\\n\\nMr. Summers consulted his list. \\u201cClyde Dunbar,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s right. He\\u2019s broke his leg, hasn\\u2019t he? Who\\u2019s drawing for him?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMe, I guess,\\u201d a woman said, and Mr. Summers turned to look at her. \\u201cWife draws for her husband,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. \\u201cDon\\u2019t you have a grown boy to do it for you, Janey?\\u201d Although Mr. Summers and everyone else in the village knew the answer perfectly well, it was the business of the official of the lottery to ask such questions formally. Mr. Summers waited with an expression of polite interest while Mrs. Dunbar answered.\\n\\n\\u201cHorace\\u2019s not but sixteen yet,\\u201d Mrs. Dunbar said regretfully. \\u201cGuess I gotta fill in for the old man this year.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cRight,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. He made a note on the list he was holding. Then he asked, \\u201cWatson boy drawing this year?\\u201d\\n\\nA tall boy in the crowd raised his hand. \\u201cHere,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m drawing for m\\u2019mother and me.\\u201d He blinked his eyes nervously and ducked his head as several voices in the crowd said things like \\u201cGood fellow, Jack,\\u201d and \\u201cGlad to see your mother\\u2019s got a man to do it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, \\u201cguess that\\u2019s everyone. Old Man Warner make it?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHere,\\u201d a voice said, and Mr. Summers nodded.\\n\\nA sudden hush fell on the crowd as Mr. Summers cleared his throat and looked at the list. \\u201cAll ready?\\u201d he called. \\u201cNow, I\\u2019ll read the names\\u2014heads of families first\\u2014and the men come up and take a paper out of the box. Keep the paper folded in your hand without looking at it until everyone has had a turn. Everything clear?\\u201d\\n\\nThe people had done it so many times that they only half listened to the directions; most of them were quiet, wetting their lips, not looking around. Then Mr. Summers raised one hand high and said, \\u201cAdams.\\u201d A man disengaged himself from the crowd and came forward. \\u201cHi, Steve,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, and Mr. Adams said, \\u201cHi, Joe.\\u201d They grinned at one another humorlessly and nervously. Then Mr. Adams reached into the black box and took out a folded paper. He held it firmly by one corner as he turned and went hastily back to his place in the crowd, where he stood a little apart from his family, not looking down at his hand.\\n\\n\\u201cAllen,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. \\u201cAnderson. . . . Bentham.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSeems like there\\u2019s no time at all between lotteries any more,\\u201d Mrs. Delacroix said to Mrs. Graves in the back row. \\u201cSeems like we got through with the last one only last week.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTime sure goes fast,\\u201d Mrs. Graves said.\\n\\n\\u201cClark. . . . Delacroix.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThere goes my old man,\\u201d Mrs. Delacroix said. She held her breath while her husband went forward.\\n\\n\\u201cDunbar,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, and Mrs. Dunbar went steadily to the box while one of the women said, \\u201cGo on, Janey,\\u201d and another said, \\u201cThere she goes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re next,\\u201d Mrs. Graves said. She watched while Mr. Graves came around from the side of the box, greeted Mr. Summers gravely, and selected a slip of paper from the box. By now, all through the crowd there were men holding the small folded papers in their large hands, turning them over and over nervously. Mrs. Dunbar and her two sons stood together, Mrs. Dunbar holding the slip of paper.\\n\\n\\u201cHarburt. . . . Hutchinson.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGet up there, Bill,\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson said, and the people near her laughed.\\n\\n\\u201cJones.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey do say,\\u201d Mr. Adams said to Old Man Warner, who stood next to him, \\u201cthat over in the north village they\\u2019re talking of giving up the lottery.\\u201d\\n\\nOld Man Warner snorted. \\u201cPack of crazy fools,\\u201d he said. \\u201cListening to the young folks, nothing\\u2019s good enough for them. Next thing you know, they\\u2019ll be wanting to go back to living in caves, nobody work any more, live that way for a while. Used to be a saying about \\u2018Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon.\\u2019 First thing you know, we\\u2019d all be eating stewed chickweed and acorns. There\\u2019s always been a lottery,\\u201d he added petulantly. \\u201cBad enough to see young Joe Summers up there joking with everybody.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSome places have already quit lotteries,\\u201d Mrs. Adams said.\\n\\n\\u201cNothing but trouble in that,\\u201d Old Man Warner said stoutly. \\u201cPack of young fools.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMartin.\\u201d And Bobby Martin watched his father go forward. \\u201cOverdyke. . . . Percy.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI wish they\\u2019d hurry,\\u201d Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son. \\u201cI wish they\\u2019d hurry.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re almost through,\\u201d her son said.\\n\\n\\u201cYou get ready to run tell Dad,\\u201d Mrs. Dunbar said.\\n\\nMr. Summers called his own name and then stepped forward precisely and selected a slip from the box. Then he called, \\u201cWarner.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSeventy-seventh year I been in the lottery,\\u201d Old Man Warner said as he went through the crowd. \\u201cSeventy-seventh time.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWatson.\\u201d The tall boy came awkwardly through the crowd. Someone said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t be nervous, Jack,\\u201d and Mr. Summers said, \\u201cTake your time, son.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cZanini.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter that, there was a long pause, a breathless pause, until Mr. Summers, holding his slip of paper in the air, said, \\u201cAll right, fellows.\\u201d For a minute, no one moved, and then all the slips of paper were opened. Suddenly, all the women began to speak at once, saying, \\u201cWho is it?,\\u201d \\u201cWho\\u2019s got it?,\\u201d \\u201cIs it the Dunbars?,\\u201d \\u201cIs it the Watsons?\\u201d Then the voices began to say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s Hutchinson. It\\u2019s Bill,\\u201d \\u201cBill Hutchinson\\u2019s got it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGo tell your father,\\u201d Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son.\\n\\nPeople began to look around to see the Hutchinsons. Bill Hutchinson was standing quiet, staring down at the paper in his hand. Suddenly, Tessie Hutchinson shouted to Mr. Summers, \\u201cYou didn\\u2019t give him time enough to take any paper he wanted. I saw you. It wasn\\u2019t fair!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBe a good sport, Tessie,\\u201d Mrs. Delacroix called, and Mrs. Graves said, \\u201cAll of us took the same chance.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cShut up, Tessie,\\u201d Bill Hutchinson said.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, everyone,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, \\u201cthat was done pretty fast, and now we\\u2019ve got to be hurrying a little more to get done in time.\\u201d He consulted his next list. \\u201cBill,\\u201d he said, \\u201cyou draw for the Hutchinson family. You got any other households in the Hutchinsons?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s Don and Eva,\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson yelled. \\u201cMake them take their chance!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDaughters draw with their husbands\\u2019 families, Tessie,\\u201d Mr. Summers said gently. \\u201cYou know that as well as anyone else.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t fair,\\u201d Tessie said.\\n\\n\\u201cI guess not, Joe,\\u201d Bill Hutchinson said regretfully. \\u201cMy daughter draws with her husband\\u2019s family, that\\u2019s only fair. And I\\u2019ve got no other family except the kids.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen, as far as drawing for families is concerned, it\\u2019s you,\\u201d Mr. Summers said in explanation, \\u201cand as far as drawing for households is concerned, that\\u2019s you, too. Right?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cRight,\\u201d Bill Hutchinson said.\\n\\n\\u201cHow many kids, Bill?\\u201d Mr. Summers asked formally.\\n\\n\\u201cThree,\\u201d Bill Hutchinson said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s Bill, Jr., and Nancy, and little Dave. And Tessie and me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAll right, then,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. \\u201cHarry, you got their tickets back?\\u201d\\n\\nMr. Graves nodded and held up the slips of paper. \\u201cPut them in the box, then,\\u201d Mr. Summers directed. \\u201cTake Bill\\u2019s and put it in.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI think we ought to start over,\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson said, as quietly as she could. \\u201cI tell you it wasn\\u2019t fair. You didn\\u2019t give him time enough to choose. Everybody saw that.\\u201d\\n\\nMr. Graves had selected the five slips and put them in the box, and he dropped all the papers but those onto the ground, where the breeze caught them and lifted them off.\\n\\n\\u201cListen, everybody,\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson was saying to the people around her.\\n\\n\\u201cReady, Bill?\\u201d Mr. Summers asked, and Bill Hutchinson, with one quick glance around at his wife and children, nodded.\\n\\n\\u201cRemember,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, \\u201ctake the slips and keep them folded until each person has taken one. Harry, you help little Dave.\\u201d Mr. Graves took the hand of the little boy, who came willingly with him up to the box. \\u201cTake a paper out of the box, Davy,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. Davy put his hand into the box and laughed. \\u201cTake just one paper,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. \\u201cHarry, you hold it for him.\\u201d Mr. Graves took the child\\u2019s hand and removed the folded paper from the tight fist and held it while little Dave stood next to him and looked up at him wonderingly.\\n\\n\\u201cNancy next,\\u201d Mr. Summers said.

What was the problem? Did she just not enjoy the world anymore? Had the world gotten away from her? Had the world gotten worse? (Maybe, probably not.

And does she sense this? Does she know she is intrinsically less likable and instead of resisting, does she lean into it, as into a cold wind? Maybe (likely) she used to resist, but now she sees the futility, so each morning when she opens her mouth she is unlikable, proudly so, and each evening before sleep she is unlikable, and each day it goes on this way, she getting more unlikable by the hour, until one morning she will be so unlikable, inconveniently unlikable, that she will have to be shoved into a hole and left there.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The protagonist of the story is a woman who has noticed a significant change in herself.

Even her silence, facial expressions, or small reactions are perceived as unlikable. She resents her inability to enjoy the world anymore and wonders if the world itself has become worse or if she has become disconnected from it. She questions whether her age, now being forty-one, has contributed to her increasing unlikability, as if any action performed at this age is inherently less likable compared to when she was younger. She ponders if she is aware of this intrinsic unlikability and has embraced it, accepting it as futile to resist.

She ponders on the reasons behind her unlikable nature, questioning whether she has lost interest in the world or if the world has transformed in some negative way.

You don\\u2019t walk, you creep. Some days you crawl. Others, best just to lie still. The closets are full of ghosts. Blouses she wore when she was twenty-six. A denim skirt. Killer dresses. Shoes\\u2014heels, pumps, a pair of Capezio tap shoes\\u2014entombed in boxes. When you open the closet door her coats hold still, suspecting they\\u2019re gonners. Threads of memory. She wore this one there, that one here. Every garment a chapter. The clothes of the dead have no future. You could burn them. You could leave them be, decades of sartorial history hanging from a pole sagging with the weight of remembrance. You could cross-dress with a vengeance. Everything Must Go. Not discarded, donated. To the Women\\u2019s Shelter, cartons and paper bags and piles of clothes, until the woman behind the counter says they\\u2019re overstocked. You\\u2019re tempted to take them all back. Who denies the donation of a dead woman\\u2019s clothes? The rest to St. Vincent DePaul\\u2019s, and there her cottons and linens and rayon blends are added to bins heaped with corduroy and polyester. (But for one satin nightgown that will not be donated.) Until the closets seem empty. Your clothes don\\u2019t count\\u2014they aren\\u2019t you, but just neglected shirts, pants, and jackets. As summer wanes, you open a drawer and find sweaters, scarves, wool hats and gloves. Gear for a woman who understood winter. You send sweaters and shawls and silk scarves to the women and girls in her family. They respond with photographs of ten year old daughters wrapped in blue for the fifth grade\\u2019s Colonial Day. Still you are possessed by possessions. Even after you dispossess yourself, they turn up in the kitchen drawers and cabinets, where she kept jars of dry goods, beans and grains, future meals. And there, in the freezer, plastic containers: soups, tomato sauce, chili. Nutritional messages from the afterlife. Hoard them. Defrost only as a last resort. Yet through the winter the freezer becomes as spacious and cold as your heart. By the time you open the last tub, labeled Black Bean Chili 3/14/10, food no longer has any meaning. It\\u2019s no longer an act of love, a gesture of kindness. There is no intimacy in tuna salad or in marinating chicken thighs. It\\u2019s embarrassing to recall how often you ate by candlelight; it\\u2019s like the satin nightgown tucked away in a drawer you never open. Instead just heat and serve. Just nuke it. Just eat. Overcooked sustenance. When you eat dinner right out of the skillet or pot, the temptation is to glance over your shoulder in shame. No one is watching, except the cookbooks. Shelves of cookbooks, back issues of Gourmet and Bon Appetit, and a three-ring binder stuffed with recipes, a culinary legacy handed down from grandmother to mother to daughter. Recipes written in her short hand, scrolls and waves and loops fetching across the page with an occasional word, a white cap of English. Instructions for future meals, for candlelight dinners, for guests. There are no recipes now, there are no guests; no need for the wedding china, the good tablecloth. Don\\u2019t forget Widower\\u2019s Rule #1: Never turn down a dinner invitation. You\\u2019re the guest now. And after dinner you walk about the house, speaking to the dark. Go ahead, come back and haunt me. Move the book on the table. Slam the bedroom door. Anything, I\\u2019m ready. Go ahead, I dare you. Scare me to death. I am ready. The reply is the deepest silence. Yet sometimes you feel her in the silence: nothing moves, no hinges creak, no lights flicker. Just her silence. Fuck you, Stephen Spielberg; death has no special effects. There is no possession, just possessions. To break the silence you play music. CDs in horizontal stacks; vertical rows of plastic jewel boxes, never properly alphabetized (as she so often suggested). Songs with melodies, lyrics, choruses, verses, movements, codas. Songs you can\\u2019t live without. Songs you\\u2019ll never listen to again. Songs you know by heart. Songs you want to forget. Songs you can\\u2019t forget. Songs for dinner, for reading, for dancing, for killing a bottle of wine, for making love. Songs to break the silence. Songs against eternal darkness. But one day (maybe) you\\u2019ll make a deal with the silence. You\\u2019ll sit in her grandparents\\u2019 chair and it will only be a chair. Or you could give it away. All of it. Everything. Everything except the stones. She was forever (or so it seemed) gathering beach stones. She\\u2019d return from a beach with her coat pockets sagging, doing her best Virginia Woolf. Round stones, egg-shaped stones, disk-shaped stones, stones ground smooth by water and time. Stones from England, Scotland, Ireland, Italy, Turkey, Cape Cod. Stones stored in shoe boxes, in plastic bags, in bowls; clusters of stones distributed about the house like incense. She liked the look of them, the feel of them, rattling in her palm. You could get rid of it all, but not the stones. You could walk on them, sleep on them, sit on them, eat off of them. Your house would be silent, filled with stones. You would have solitude.

After finishing the sixth grade, we had stopped calling them sleepovers. Ramona had a full-sized bed, but I still felt scrunched up next to her when we were in it. We didn\\u2019t press into each other while we slept, but I think I felt pushed up against her because of what I knew about her heart. About how sometimes it flipped and somersaulted and somehow ended up on the outside of her skin, resting there on the wrong side of her body for a few seconds like a wild bird afraid to fly away but so eager to do it.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen my family moved here, I was afraid I wouldn\\u2019t make a single friend.\\u201d\\n\\nI told Ramona this while we were sitting out on her front steps at dusk, sucking on popsicles and bored out of our minds.

Or better yet: for a boy\\u2014two of them!\\u2014to pass by Ramona\\u2019s house, trying to slouch their shoulders and barely nod while glancing our way. But half of the summer was dead already and neither of those things had happened.\\n\\n\\u201cI thought meeting new people would be hard,\\u201d I said, chewing on my splintered popsicle stick. \\u201cAnd then bam, I met you.\\u201d\\n\\nThis wasn\\u2019t exactly true. I felt the urge to exaggerate things when I was around Ramona. I found myself making up little lies. I was the only person in the entire world who knew about her heart thing. I felt like I owed her something. I had nothing to confess, and so I made things up.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m afraid of being abducted by aliens,\\u201d I lied.\\n\\n\\u201cI shoplifted a bag of peanut M&Ms in the checkout line, standing right next to my mom,\\u201d I lied.\\n\\n\\u201cSheila Hastings is stupid. Her bangs are ugly,\\u201d I lied. \\u201cAnd I kicked her once in the hallway on the way to lunch.\\u201d\\n\\nThat summer, three bad things happened. Matt Gowen\\u2019s dad died of cancer. Tracy Turner\\u2019s dog Velvet got run over by a minivan. And then, at the beginning of August, Troy Benson\\u2019s little brother climbed into the baby pool and started to drown in only a few inches of water. The paramedics had to do CPR, and we all decided he\\u2019d be messed up forever after going through something like that.\\n\\n\\u201cI wonder what it would be like if I started jogging,\\u201d Ramona said one night while we were sitting on her bed, painting our toenails lime green.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s all she said, but I knew exactly what she meant. Some girls our age had started jogging around the neighborhood in packs. It was the girls who had started to develop. They didn\\u2019t jog because it was healthy. They jogged so they could wear tight, neon-colored exercise clothes, the sudden swelling on their chests pushing out against bright elastic, tugging them forward along the streets of our neighborhood and into the rest of their lives. I knew that Ramona wanted to jog and see if her heart would push itself out while she was panting and sputtering. She\\u2019d have a bulge on her little chest then. Who cares if it was only on one side?  Imagine being with a boy, in a basement or a closet, and then that sudden beating on the outside of your chest. Imagine that he wouldn\\u2019t be grossed out at all. Imagine that he\\u2019d let out a moan, some unbelievable sound, because of the way your body was being right there in front of him. Ramona never confessed to any daydreams like that, but I knew she had them. I had them for her.\\n\\nI practically lived at Ramona\\u2019s house that summer. Almost every night I was stretched out there on her bed, waiting for sleep and feeling the humidity press into every part of me like a secret I figured someday I might identify and then maybe understand.\\n\\n\\u201cSee,\\u201d she said the first time she showed me. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like this.\\u201d\\n\\nRamona pulled her tank top up and there it was: a heart beating on the outside of her chest. I didn\\u2019t scream like I thought I would. I didn\\u2019t cover my eyes or gag or laugh uncontrollably. I just looked at it. I nodded my head. \\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said. And then I blinked or glanced at her face, and when I looked again it was already gone. She didn\\u2019t have her bra on. We had each bought the same size and the same style at the beginning of the summer, even though neither of us needed one yet. We hardly wore them when it was just the two of us lazing around her house, waiting for the world to happen. Ramona kept her tank top pulled up even after her heart had disappeared. I stared at her chest. It was creamy and bare and ordinary\\u2014no trace of the bloody, glistening muscle that had been galloping there only seconds before.\\n\\nI miss Ramona. It\\u2019s a simple kind of missing. It\\u2019s the way vague regret and longing pool in your stomach when you shouldn\\u2019t be feeling anything at all\\u2014while pulling laundry out of the washer, while walking the dog, while reaching for something in the shower with your eyes squeezed shut. The two of us were careless and let whatever we had dissolve into a leftover pang of almost-nostalgia. Who knows where she is now?\\n\\n\\u201cTurn your stomach inside out,\\u201d she said one night.\\n\\nI was almost asleep. I opened my eyes up to the dark.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI mean, for real,\\u201d she said. There was that mean, annoyed flip that sometimes came out at the ends of her sentences.\\n\\n\\u201cLike this,\\u201d she said. She turned on the little lamp next to her bed, and her heart was there again, beating and wet against the delicate V of her unbuttoned nightgown. The openings and valves and the whole mess of it sucked at the air like an angry, stranded fish.\\n\\nI think about that heart late at night, my husband pressed here in bed next to me. I try to reach back into my childhood and pin lanky, eleven-year-old Ramona with eating disorders and depression and the hungry, open mouth of loneliness. But really, it was just that thing with her heart. That\\u2019s all. And I\\u2019m jealous. I still do it\\u2014lie here in bed and try to push things outside of myself.

\"Author\": \"Ogbewe Amadin\", \"story\": \"I think Aunty Adesuwa is a witch. Mama says so sometimes.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat is a witch?\\u201d I asked Mama once.\\n\\n\\u201cA witch is an unusual person. They are different from normal people,\\u201d Mama told me.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople call me different. Am I a witch too?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cIdara, you are not a witch, okay?!\\u201d Mama said. \\u201cYou are a kind and sweet little girl and when I\\u2019m done with you, you will be a strong, independent woman,\\u201d she told me, holding my arms as she looked into my eyes, smiling. I smiled too.\\n\\n\\u201cA witch can never be these things,\\u201d she said. \\u201cA witch is a paranormal creature that lives between the shadows cast by daylight. They traverse the infinities of a heartbeat, they sail in seas of dreams\\u2026 they manipulate nature.\\u201d\\n\\nI couldn\\u2019t understand Mama. It seemed to me that witches did wonderful things.\\n\\n\\u201cAbove all else, a witch is evil. Evil for a witch is its own reward,\\u201d she finished. I knew it must be true because Mama never lied.\\n\\nI wondered if Aunty Adesuwa was all these things. I think it was that day my hatred for witches began to take root. I hated how they perverted a thing that would otherwise have been beautiful. I didn\\u2019t know why Mama or anyone hadn\\u2019t stopped Aunty Adesuwa and I didn\\u2019t care to know. I would stop her myself.\\n\\nI once saw Aunty Adesuwa eavesdropping on my mother and two of her friends. I didn\\u2019t know how to signal Mama without her seeing me. My palms became sweaty and my breathing difficult.\\n\\n\\u201cWe all know Adesuwa killed her ex-husband\\u2019s illegitimate child,\\u201d Aunty Bisi, one of Mama\\u2019s friends said. She probably thought she was whispering. She wasn\\u2019t. Aunty Bisi always complained about my clothing to my mom. She had a big nose. I didn\\u2019t like her. As I stood paralyzed by fear, Aunty Adesuwa burst into the meeting. She was all tears and fury.\\n\\n\\u201cI loved that child!\\u201d she screamed. Mama and her friends stared open-mouthed at her.\\n\\n\\u201cAm I the cancer that afflicted him?\\u201d she asked. \\u201cYou\\u2019re all typical weak women! You judge me for leaving a man who was perpetually unfaithful. You judge me for doing well for myself without his help. You blame me for his misfortunes. You blame me for the death of a child whom I loved regardless of the manner of his conception.\\u201d\\n\\nWhile she talked I felt it resonating in my bones. My blood seemed to heat up in my veins as if her words scorched my insides. I wondered if Mama and her friends felt this strangeness. They didn\\u2019t seem to.\\n\\n\\u201cGod will judge all of you\\u201d Aunty Adesuwa said finally, walking away. Days later, I still pondered her words.\\n\\nIt was a sunny day, two weeks after Aunty Adesuwa\\u2019s tirade. I hid in the bushes by her house. Aunty Bisi had come down with a fever. Mama had sent me to give her and her big nose the medicinal pepper soup. I had subliminally taken a route that went past Aunty Adesuwa\\u2019s house when I saw her calling to a teenage boy. He was new in the village. His bicycle seemed worn out. I watched as she offered him a steaming plate of jollof rice and chilled Fanta. I saw a grin split his face. Generally, we were not very hospitable to strangers in our village. Even Mama was downright awful to them. I pondered this as I went to give Aunty Big Nose her pepper soup.\\n\\nThree weeks later I sneaked out of my house at midnight. Mama was sleeping like a log. She had been helping her only friend other than Aunty Bisi, Aunty Uwa with the burial of her son. He had accidently ridden his bicycle off a cliff the day he came visiting from the neighboring village. I wish I had known him.\\n\\nI walked to Aunty Adesuwa\\u2019s house. I had to see the witch in her element. It still pained me that such a fascinating and wondrous thing as magic was used for evil. I hid in the darkness watching aunty Adesuwa\\u2019s house. It was hours before I heard her back door opening. I ran on tip toes to the backyard. I saw Aunty Adesuwa, naked as her name day, striding into the forest. I followed her. It was a long walk. Finally she stepped into a moonlit clearing. As I watched her, I felt a migraine that blurred my sight. In the place where Aunty Adesuwa should have been, there was instead the body of a very large cat with her head still human. Her glowing eyes were looking right at my hidden position in the bushes.\\n\\n\\u201cIdara,\\u201d she hissed.\\n\\nMy heart pounded violently. My whole body shook with trepidation. I steadied myself as best as I could and stepped out with Mama\\u2019s kitchen knife clutched in my trembling hands.\\n\\n\\u201cI hate you,\\u201d I said.\\n\\n\\u201cWhy?\\u201d she purred innocently.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Cause you\\u2019re evil,\\u201d I said.\\n\\n\\u201cAre you certain?\\u201d she asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said, nodding to myself. Mama had told me witches were evil. She had also said Aunty Adesuwa was a witch. Therefore, Aunty Adesuwa was evil.\\n\\n\\u201cI know you\\u2019ve been watching, Idara. Your mother taught you better than to jump to conclusions,\\u201d she chided.\\n\\n\\u201cConsider the facts,\\u201d she said. It was something Mama always said to me that helped me solve riddles.\\n\\n\\u201cThe riddle of witches?\\u201d I asked\\n\\n\\u201dThe riddle of my witchcraft,\\u201d she replied.\\n\\nI pondered thoughts I had kept in the deep recesses of my mind. I was sure witches were evil because Mama never lied. I was sure Aunty Adesuwa was a witch after seeing her transformation but was I sure Aunty Adesuwa was evil?\\n\\nAunty Adesuwa had been kind and sweet to the stranger with the bicycle. She had loved her stepson. She had also shown her strength and independence by leaving her cheating husband and thriving without him. She was also a witch. This was my confusion.\\n\\nMama said a witch could never be these things.\\n\\n\\u201cThings not adding up, yes?\\u201d she asked, amused by my consternation.\\n\\nIt hit me. Aunty Adesuwa must be a good witch. They actually existed! The realization rekindled a forgotten hope of mine.\\n\\n\\u201cWill you teach me to be a good witch like you?\\u201d I asked her.\\n\\nShe purred contentedly. She seemed to have anticipated my response. I suppose I should have been scared. I wasn\\u2019t.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, sweet child. I will teach you to be a witch\\u2026 just like me,\\u201d she said, her tail swinging leisurely behind her.\\n\\n\\u201cThank you, Aunty,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nShe stalked away into the deep foliage gesturing me to follow with her tail.\\n\\nAs I followed, I thought of Mama. Mama never lied but she was human. She could make mistakes. She didn\\u2019t know about good witches. I thought about how I would make her proud. I would show her the beauty I had only ever seen in my sea of dreams.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story revolves around a young girl named Idara who believes her Aunt Adesuwa is a witch because her mother insists on it sometimes. Idara asks her mother what a witch is, to which her mother explains that witches are evil beings who manipulate nature and live between the shadows. Confused, Idara wonders if she is also a witch since she is often called different by others.\\n\\nIdara's hatred for witches grows when she witnesses Aunt Adesuwa eavesdropping on her mother and her friends discussing how Aunt Adesuwa allegedly killed her ex-husband's illegitimate child. Aunt Adesuwa bursts into the meeting, defending herself and stating that she loved the child regardless of how he was conceived. Idara is deeply affected by Aunt Adesuwa's words and begins to ponder her own feelings towards witches.\\n\\nOne day, Idara sees Aunt Adesuwa being kind to a teenage boy and realizes that not all strangers are treated kindly in their village.

ROB-X164, seated to your left, will be sworn in as your replacement, with a formal announcement coming this afternoon.

But, for some reason, we both decided, without spelling it out, not to push it. Nothing was going to come of this, of us, we had hours to go, and it was all right just to let the silence be and listen to the radio. We were on our way to a s\\u00e9ance she\\u2019d heard about from an old high-school friend. She\\u2019d grown up in a small town southwest of St. Louis, and the s\\u00e9ance was being held nearby, at an abandoned air-force base.\\n\\nWe\\u2019d met a couple of nights before. Beth had come into the restaurant near the Loop where I waited tables, and had written her number on a napkin. \\u201cCall me,\\u201d she\\u2019d ordered. A couple of nights later, over drinks, she told me that she wasn\\u2019t the kind of person who ordered people to call her. Something about my face had said that I needed to be told what to do. That was also when she mentioned that this s\\u00e9ance was happening at 2:00 A.M. near St. Louis. If we left right away, she said, we could probably make it. The fact that we both had to be at work the next day made it all the more spontaneous and awesome. We headed out into the night exalted, until, like I said, our conversation dried up completely. It was as if the intrepid adventure were already over and now we just had a shitlong ride ahead of us, which we did.\\n\\nWhen I woke up, we were already past St. Louis and Beth had turned off onto a narrow two-lane highway that cut through a forest.

Is that you, Marina?\\u201d Then other people were speaking, too. \\u201cLarry, tell your sister I\\u2019m onto her games.\\u201d \\u201cHow many years did you think you could hide in plain sight, Ramon?\\u201d Even Beth got into it: \\u201cYou never loved me, not a day, not an hour, not a second of a single minute\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nEverybody was speaking at once, and I had trouble discerning individual words in the chaos of voices. And it was ridiculous, it was beyond ridiculous, but it also wasn\\u2019t ridiculous. Shouts in the dark. Maybe that\\u2019s the best we can do to reach beyond ourselves. I tried to join in, too, but I could sense none of my dead, and I couldn\\u2019t, for the life of me, think of anything to just spout out. So I bought it, but at the same time, by that point, I was just trying to live through it, I was so cold. Then the candle went out and our leader broke ranks and swooped down to relight it, but his lighter jammed. We all stopped speaking and began patting down our pockets for a lighter or matches. But our leader shouted at us, \\u201cNo! Don\\u2019t break the membrane! Re-bond!\\u201d\\n\\nWe never quite got back on track after that. The collective spirit or belief or whatever it was escaped from us, and, though our leader mumbled for another half an hour, only a few people spoke up. The guy next to me, a guy I\\u2019d been holding hands with for almost two hours without getting a look at his face, actually made a joke. At least, I thought it was a joke. He said something about the temperature of coffee in hell. I laughed out loud. No one else did. That pretty much ended it. Before we left, Beth went up to the leader and gave him a kiss on the lips that wasn\\u2019t a friend\\u2019s kiss, not by a long stretch. In the car, I asked her who she\\u2019d reached. She said she didn\\u2019t want to talk about it.\\n\\n\\u201cSo you and the dude\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat was nothing. O.K.?\\u201d\\n\\nWe settled back into the silence of the drive. No radio now, just the drone of the engine, which you don\\u2019t hear unless you listen for it, and then it\\u2019s there all the time. It was getting toward dawn, and the dark was giving way to gray. I\\u2019ve always loved that early-morning gloom. I was about to say as much, to try to chip away at the silence, when I noticed that the car had begun to drift into the oncoming lane. Beth had fallen asleep. I don\\u2019t know why but, instead of grabbing the wheel, I seized her shoulder. She woke up but didn\\u2019t seem to realize what was happening and immediately stomped on the brakes. We jolted forward, skidded, and stopped. Headlights were approaching out of the gray. I had time for only one thing. I opened my door, got out, ran off the road into the trees, and waited for the headlights to slam into Beth.\\n\\nThey didn\\u2019t. The other driver saw her in time and fishtailed around her and stopped. For a few moments, everything was still. Then I heard the birds in the trees. I walked back out to the road. The guy rolled down the window of his truck. He looked at Beth in her car; he looked at me. Then he drove away, as if some lovers\\u2019 spat weren\\u2019t worth anything he might have mustered up to say. My door was still open. Beth was calm, motionless, her hands still gripping the wheel.\\n\\nWhen something happens, for better or for worse it\\u2019s happened. It has a before. It has an after. Maybe you can talk about it. Maybe you can\\u2019t. But what about something that almost happens? What almost happens repeats itself. I\\u2019ve come to believe this as a kind of personal gospel. We\\u2019re stopped in the opposite lane. I see lights emerge out of the gray. I open my door and run. I leave her in the car to die.

No one had any need for this stuff\\u2014not my mother and certainly not me\\u2014but I like unnecessary things: all the pragmatic, commercial, and manipulative meaning has disappeared from them, any usefulness has evaporated, leaving only their naked souls, their true selves, all that was heretofore hidden by the hustle and bustle of passing days.\\n\\nWhile digging in the cupboard under the stairs, surrounded by grimy burlap and old ski poles that none of us could bring ourselves to throw away, groping in the dark in the space between the wall and the storage chest, I found the bear or, to be more precise, his remains: a furry wooden frame with a single front paw, a plastic button for one eye and bits of hanging black thread for the other.\\n\\nI grabbed him, holding him tight, clutching his dusty, bristly torso, and closing my eyes to keep the unexpected stream of tears from raining down on him.

Everything there was insultingly new\\u2014that is, unfamiliar and alien.

Whenever children use blue paint, tiny particles of it dissolve from their hands into the air and color it blue.  Over time the pigment fades, but as long as there is fingerpainting, there will always be blue sky.\\n\\nAnother answer is related to the blue-eyed creatures at the North and South Poles.  They are always looking up into the sky, and the blue of their eyes reflects back for the whole world to see.  You\\u2019ve probably never heard of these polar creatures because they know how to hide from satellites and explorers.  The reflection of their eyes is all we\\u2019ll ever see of them.\\n\\nBut the answer I think is true right now concerns angels and blueberries. \\n\\nYou see, blueberries are the angels\\u2019 favorite food.  There\\u2019s nothing they like more; and berries are healthy, so it\\u2019s a happy coincidence.  The only problem is, angels are sloppy eaters, and they eat pretty much all day. Of course they do other things like play the harp and sing and keep little babies from getting into the bleach under the sink. But they still have lots of time to munch on blueberries\\u2014they live forever, after all\\u2014so little bits of blueberry wind up all over the sky.\\n\\nEven worse, some angels don\\u2019t like the blueberry skins, so they peel each berry before eating it and toss the skins to the side.  This doesn\\u2019t make them blatant litterers, mind you\\u2014they know they\\u2019ll get around to picking up the skins, just not at that very moment.\\n\\nSo as the day goes on, the angels eat more and more berries; and as the sun goes down, its light reflects through the berry pulp and juice, creating wonderful reds and oranges and yellows.  And still the angels eat, and the sky grows darker and darker with blue skins and bits of berry.  The angels keep on munching until, with the exception of little gaps for the moon and stars, no light can get to the Earth at all.  In fact, there\\u2019s not even enough room for the moon most of the time, which is why you only see the whole thing once a month.\\n\\nIn the middle of the night God finally has enough, and she tells the angels they have to start cleaning up their mess.  Of course they start right away, but it\\u2019s a big mess and it takes a while.  And as they clean, you can see a little bits of light start to penetrate the layer of blueberry waste.  Dawn begins as they wipe and scrub, and daylight breaks when they finally clear away enough blueberries for the sun to shine on the Earth again. \\n\\nThe one problem is that blueberry skins stain, and the angels can\\u2019t scrub the traces away completely.  Some days they do better, and the sky is light blue.  But on very sunny days you can see the full extent of the staining and the sky is a rich, dark blue.  But God isn\\u2019t that concerned about the stains.  She actually thinks they\\u2019re pretty, and the renters down on the surface don\\u2019t mind, and she\\u2019s not planning on moving anytime soon, so it\\u2019s not like she has to worry about resale value.  What matters to her is that the angels did their best.\\n\\nNow, you may wonder what would happen if the angels ever got tired of blueberries.  What would happen if they switched to raspberries?  Would the sky eventually wind up purple?  If they started eating bananas, would the yellow peels turn the blue sky green?  Or if they developed a fondness for lemons, would the juice bleach the color out forever?  And if that happened, would your grandchildren ever believe the sky had once been blue? \\n\\nOr would they just think you were a silly writer telling stories about angels and blueberries?\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story is a whimsical and imaginative explanation of why the sky is blue. The narrator presents multiple fantastical explanations, each with its own unique twist.\\n\\nFirstly, the narrator suggests that the blue color of the sky comes from the particles of blue fingerpaint that children dissolve into the air when they use it. This idea implies that as long as there is fingerpainting, the sky will always be blue.\\n\\nNext, the narrator introduces the concept of blue-eyed creatures at the North and South Poles. These creatures constantly look up at the sky, and the blue reflection from their eyes is what gives the sky its color. These creatures are said to be elusive and skilled at hiding from satellites and explorers.\\n\\nThe third explanation revolves around angels and blueberries. The narrator claims that blueberries are the favorite food of angels. However, angels are messy eaters, and as they eat blueberries all day, tiny bits of the fruit end up in the sky. The angels also discard the berry skins, which contributes to the blue mess in the sky. When the sky becomes dark with blueberry remnants, God commands the angels to clean up their mess. As they scrub away the blueberry waste, bits of light start to penetrate the sky, and dawn breaks when enough blueberries are cleared for the sun to shine on the Earth again.\\n\\nThe story emphasizes that despite the stains left behind by blueberry skins, God finds them beautiful and does not mind the marks on the sky. The narrator poses the question of what would happen if the angels decided to eat something other than blueberries, implying that the sky's color could potentially change based on their food preferences. However, these further explanations are left to the imagination.\\n\\nThroughout the story, the narrator suggests that different people may have different answers to why the sky is blue, depending on their perspective or creativity. The story encourages a sense of wonder and imagination, leaving the readers to contemplate their own interpretations of the sky.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"In this whimsical and imaginative story, the narrator provides various answers to the question of why the sky is blue. The answers range from scientific explanations to creative explanations involving fictional creatures and objects. Each response represents a different approach and perspective. \\n\\nThe story starts by acknowledging that an adult's answer to the question is scientific and technical, explaining how light interacts with air particles to create the color blue. The narrative then transitions into imaginative responses. First, it suggests that the color blue in the sky comes from the particles of blue fingerpaint that dissolve into the air when children use it. This theory claims that the constant fingerpainting of children always ensures a blue sky.\\n\\nThe narrative further expresses that the skies could be blue because of blue-eyed creatures living at the poles. These creatures remain hidden from human explorers and spy satellites, but their blue eyes contribute to the sky's color. They act as mirrors, reflecting the blue of their eyes into the atmosphere.\\n\\nTowards the end, the story's conclusion settles on the idea that the blueberries angels consume creates the blue hue of the atmospheric sky. The angels, who are attributed with various duties, enjoy snacking on blueberries throughout eternity. As they eat, stray bits of blueberry go all over the sky; their purple juice creates the warm tones seen during sunset. Eventually, their meal debris becomes so extensive that it obstructs any light reaching the Earth, resulting in nighttime.\\n\\nGod, seeing enough of this mess, instructs the angels to clean up. Thus, they tirelessly scrub and wipe away the blueberry remnants, allowing daylight to reemerge for humans to enjoy once again. They cannot, however, removed all the stains, leading to variations in the appearance of the sky, depending on the sunlight. God, unconcerned about the staining, appreciates their effort and the beauty it brings to the sky.\\n\\nThe story concludes by playfully pondering about potential scenarios in which the angels switch their fruit preference, humorously speculating how different fruits might alter the sky's color. Ultimately, the story leaves readers with the question of whether individuals who hear and believe these stories and explanations might be seen as silly storytellers themselves.\", \"story_token_count\": 1087, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 470, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 529}, {\"Title\": \"BABY DOLLS\", \"Author\": \"Becky Robison\", \"story\": \"My mother isn\\u2019t always Raggedy Ann, but she was when I was born.

On its banks at this point grow numerous palms, luxuriant magnolias and bay trees with a dense undergrowth of ferns, cat-tails and rope-grass. On the bosom of the stream float millions of delicately colored hyacinths.

You let \\u2019em go on!\\u201d\\n\\nAlfred laid his hand on his son\\u2019s head lovingly. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s mattah, son?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMah ships, pa,\\u201d the child answered weeping. \\u201cAh throwed \\u2019em in to go way off an\\u2019 them ole weeds won\\u2019t let \\u2019em.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, well, doan cry. Ah thought youse uh grown up man. Men doan cry lak babies. You mustn\\u2019t take it too hard \\u2019bout yo\\u2019 ships. You gotta git uster things gittin\\u2019 tied up. They\\u2019s lotser folks that \\u2019ud go on off too ef somethin\\u2019 didn\\u2019 ketch \\u2019em an\\u2019 hol\\u2019 \\u2019em!\\u201d\\n\\nAlfred Redding\\u2019s brown face grew wistful for a moment, and the child noticing it, asked quickly: \\u201cDo weeds tangle up folks too, pa?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNow, no, chile, doan be takin\\u2019 too much stock of what Ah say. Ah talks in parables sometimes. Come on, les go on tuh supper.\\u201d\\n\\nAlf took his son\\u2019s hand, and started slowly toward the house. Soon John broke the silence.\\n\\n\\u201cPa, when Ah gets as big as you Ah\\u2019m goin\\u2019 farther than them ships. Ah\\u2019m goin\\u2019 to where the sky touches the ground.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, son, when Ah wuz a boy Ah said Ah wuz goin\\u2019 too, but heah Ah am. Ah hopes you have bettah luck than me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPa, Ah betcha Ah seen somethin\\u2019 in th\\u2019 woodlot you ain\\u2019t seen!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhut?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSee dat tallest pine tree ovah dere how it looks like a skull wid a crown on?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, indeed!\\u201d said the father looking toward the tree designated. \\u201cIt do look lak a skull since you call mah \\u2019tention to it. You \\u2019magine lotser things nobody else evah did, son!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSometimes, Pa dat ole tree waves at me just aftah th\\u2019 sun goes down, an\\u2019 makes me sad an\\u2019 skeered, too.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh specks youse skeered of de dahk, thas all, sonny. When you gits biggah you won\\u2019t think of sich.\\u201d\\n\\nHand in hand the two trudged across the plowed land and up to the house, the child dreaming of the days when he should wander to far countries, and the man of the days when he might have\\u2014and thus they entered the kitchen.\\n\\nMatty Redding, John\\u2019s mother, was setting the table for supper. She was a small wiry woman with large eyes that might have been beautiful when she was young, but too much weeping had left them watery and weak.\\n\\n\\u201cMatty,\\u201d Alf began as he took his place at the table, \\u201cdontcha know our boy is different from any othah chile roun\\u2019 heah. He \\u2019lows he\\u2019s goin\\u2019 to sea when he gits grown, an\\u2019 Ah reckon Ah\\u2019ll let \\u2019im.\\u201d\\n\\nThe woman turned from the stove, skillet in hand. \\u201cAlf, you ain\\u2019t gone crazy, is you? John kain\\u2019t help wantin\\u2019 tuh stray off, cause he\\u2019s got a spell on \\u2019im; but you oughter be shamed to be encouragin\\u2019 him.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAin\\u2019t Ah done tol\\u2019 you forty times not tuh tahk dat low-life mess in front of mah boy?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, ef tain\\u2019t no conjure in de world, how come Mitch Potts been layin\\u2019 on his back six mont\\u2019s an\\u2019 de doctah kain\\u2019t do \\u2019im no good? Answer me dat. The very night John wuz bawn, Granny seed ole Witch Judy Davis creepin outer dis yahd. You know she had swore tuh fix me fuh marryin\\u2019 you, \\u2019way from her darter Edna. She put travel dust down fuh mah chile, dat\\u2019s whut she done, tuh make him walk \\u2019way fum me. An\\u2019 evuh sence he\\u2019s been able tuh crawl, he\\u2019s been tryin tuh go.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMatty, a man doan need no travel dust tuh make \\u2019im wanter hit de road. It jes\\u2019 comes natcheral fuh er man tuh travel. Dey all wants tuh go at some time or other but they kain\\u2019t all get away. Ah wants mah John tuh go an\\u2019 see cause Ah wanted to go mah self. When he comes back Ah kin see them furrin places wid his eyes. He kain\\u2019t help wantin\\u2019 tuh go cause he\\u2019s a man chile!\\u201d\\n\\nMrs. Redding promptly went off into a fit of weeping but the man and boy ate supper unmoved. Twelve years of married life had taught Alfred that far from being miserable when she wept, his wife was enjoying a bit of self-pity.\\n\\nThus John Redding grew to manhood, playing, studying and dreaming. He attended the village school as did most of the youth about him, but he also went to high school at the county seat where none of the villagers went. His father shared his dreams and ambitions, but his mother could not understand why he should wish to go strange places where neither she nor his father had been. No one of their community had ever been farther away than Jacksonville. Few indeed had ever been there. Their own gardens, general store, and occasional trips to the county seat\\u2014seven miles away\\u2014sufficed for all their needs. Life was simple indeed with these folk.\\n\\nJohn was the subject of much discussion among the country folk. Why didn\\u2019t he teach school instead of thinking about strange places and people? Did he think himself better than any of the \\u201cgals\\u201d there about that he would not go a-courting any of them? He must be \\u201cfixed\\u201d as his mother claimed, else where did his queer notions come from? Well, he was always queer, and one could not expect the man to be different from the child. They never failed to stop work at the approach of Alfred in order to be at the fence and inquire after John\\u2019s health and ask when he expected to leave.\\n\\n\\u201cOh,\\u201d Alfred would answer. \\u201cJes\\u2019 as soon as his mah gits reconciled to th\\u2019 notion. He\\u2019s a mighty dutiful boy, mah John is. He doan wanna hurt her feelings.\\u201d\\n\\nThe boy had on several occasions attempted to reconcile his mother to the notion, but found it a difficult task. Matty always took refuge in self-pity and tears. Her son\\u2019s desires were incomprehensible to her, that was all. She did not want to hurt him. It was love, mother love, that made her cling so desperately to John.\\n\\n\\u201cLawd knows,\\u201d she would sigh, \\u201cAh nevah wuz happy an\\u2019 nevah specks tuh be.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAn\\u2019 from yo\\u2019 actions,\\u201d put in Alfred hotly, \\u201cyou\\u2019s determined not to be.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThas right, Alfred, go on an\\u2019 \\u2019buse me. You allus does. Ah knows Ah\\u2019m ign\\u2019rant an\\u2019 all dat, but dis is mah son. Ah bred an\\u2019 born \\u2019im. He kain\\u2019t help from wantin\\u2019 to go rovin\\u2019 cause travel dust been put down fuh him. But mebbe we kin cure \\u2019im by disincouragin\\u2019 the idee.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, Ah wants mah son tuh go; an\\u2019 he wants tuh go too. He\\u2019s a man now, Matty. An\\u2019 we mus\\u2019 let John hoe his own row. If it\\u2019s travelin\\u2019 twon\\u2019t be foh long. He\\u2019ll come back to us bettah than when he went off. What do you say, son?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMamma,\\u201d John began slowly, \\u201cit hurts me to see you so troubled over my going away; but I feel that I must go. I\\u2019m stagnating here. This indolent atmosphere will stifle every bit of ambition that\\u2019s in me. Let me go mamma, please. What is there here for me? Why, sometimes I get to feeling just like a lump of dirt turned over by the plow\\u2014just where it falls there\\u2019s where it lies\\u2014no thought or movement or nothing. I wanter make myself something\\u2014not just stay where I was born.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNaw, John, it\\u2019s bettah for you to stay heah and take over the school. Why don\\u2019t you marry and settle down?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to, mamma. I want to go away.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell,\\u201d said Mrs. Redding, pursing her mouth tightly, \\u201cyou ainta goin\\u2019 wid mah consent!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry mamma, that you won\\u2019t consent. I am going nevertheless.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJohn, John, mah baby! You wouldn\\u2019t kill yo\\u2019 po\\u2019 ole mamma, would you? Come, kiss me, son.\\u201d\\n\\nThe boy flung his arms about his mother and held her closely while she sobbed on his breast. To all of her pleas, however, he answered that he must go.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ll stay at home this year, mamma, then I\\u2019ll go for a while, but it won\\u2019t be long. I\\u2019ll come back and make you and papa oh so happy. Do you agree, mamma dear?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh reckon tain\\u2019 nothin\\u2019 tall fuh me to do else.\\u201d\\n\\nThings went on very well around the Redding home for some time. During the day John helped his father about the farm and read a great deal at night.\\n\\nThen the unexpected happened. John married Stella Kanty, a neighbor\\u2019s daughter. The courtship was brief but ardent\\u2014on John\\u2019s part at least. He danced with Stella at a candy-pulling, walked with her home and in three weeks had declared himself. Mrs. Redding declared that she was happier than she had ever been in her life. She therefore indulged in a whole afternoon of weeping. John\\u2019s change was occasioned possibly by the fact that Stella was really beautiful; he was young and red-blooded, and the time was spring.\\n\\nSpring-time in Florida is not a matter of peeping violets or bursting buds merely. It is a riot of color in nature\\u2014glistening green leaves, pink, blue, purple, yellow blossoms that fairly stagger the visitor from the north. The miles of hyacinths lie like an undulating carpet on the surface of the river and divide reluctantly when the slow-moving alligators push their way log-like across. The nights are white nights for the moon shines with dazzling splendor, or in the absence of that goddess, the soft darkness creeps down laden with innumerable scents. The heavy fragrance of magnolias mingled with the delicate sweetness of jasmine and wild roses.\\n\\nIf time and propinquity conquered John, what then? These forces have overcome older men.\\n\\nThe raptures of the first few weeks over, John began to saunter out to the gate to gaze wistfully down the white dusty road; or to wander again to the river as he had done in childhood. To be sure he did not send forth twig-ships any longer, but his thoughts would in spite of himself, stray down river to Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world\\u2014and poor home-tied John Redding wanted to follow them.\\n\\nHe grew silent and pensive. Matty accounted for this by her ever-ready explanation of \\u201cconjuration.\\u201d Alfred said nothing but smoked and puttered about the barn more than ever. Stella accused her husband of indifference and made his life miserable with tears, accusations and pouting. At last John decided to bring matters to a head and broached the subject to his wife.\\n\\n\\u201cStella, dear, I want to go roving about the world for a spell. Would you stay here with papa and mamma and wait for me to come back?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJohn, is you crazy sho\\u2019 nuff? If you don\\u2019t want me, say so an\\u2019 I kin go home to mah folks.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStella, darling, I do want you, but I want to go away too. I can have both if you\\u2019ll let me. We\\u2019ll be so happy when I return . . .\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNaw, John, you kain\\u2019t rush me off one side like that. You didn\\u2019t hafta marry me. There\\u2019s a plenty othahs that would have been glad enuff tuh get me; you know Ah wan\\u2019t educated befo\\u2019 han\\u2019.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t make me too conscious of my weakness, Stella. I know I should never have married with my inclinations, but it\\u2019s done now, no use to talk about what is past. I love you and want to keep you, but I can\\u2019t stifle that longing for the open road, rolling seas, for peoples and countries I have never seen. I\\u2019m suffering too, Stella, I\\u2019m paying for my rashness in marrying before I was ready. I\\u2019m not trying to shirk my duty\\u2014you\\u2019ll be well taken care of in the meanwhile.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJohn, folks allus said youse queer and tol\\u2019 me not to marry yuh, but Ah jes\\u2019 loved yuh so Ah couldn\\u2019t help it, an\\u2019 now to think you wants tuh sneak off an\\u2019 leave me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut I\\u2019m coming back, darling . . . listen Stella.\\u201d\\n\\nBut the girl would not. Matty came in and Stella fell into her arms weeping. John\\u2019s mother immediately took up arms against him. The two women carried on such an effective war against him for the next few days that finally Alfred was forced to take his son\\u2019s part.\\n\\n\\u201cMatty, let dat boy alone, Ah tell you! Ef he wuz uh homebuddy he\\u2019d be drove \\u2019way by you all\\u2019s racket.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, Alf, dat\\u2019s all we po\\u2019 wimmen kin do. We wants our husbands an\\u2019 our sons. John\\u2019s got uh wife now, an\\u2019 he ain\\u2019t got no business to be talkin\\u2019 \\u2019bout goin\\u2019 nowheres. I \\u2019lowed dat marryin\\u2019 Stella would settle him.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYas, dat\\u2019s all you wimmen study \\u2019bout \\u2014settlin\\u2019 some man. You takes all de get-up out of \\u2019em. Jes\\u2019 let uh fellah mak uh motion lak gettin\\u2019 somewhere, an\\u2019 some \\u2019oman\\u2019ll begin tuh hollah, \\u2018Stop theah! where\\u2019s you goin\\u2019? Don\\u2019t fuhgit you b\\u2019longs tuh me.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy Gawd! Alf! Whut you reckon Stella\\u2019s gwine do? Let John walk off an\\u2019 leave huh?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNaw, git outer huh foolishness an\\u2019 go \\u2019long wid him. He\\u2019d take huh.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStella ain\\u2019t got no call tuh go crazy \\u2019cause John is. She ain\\u2019t no woman tuh be floppin\\u2019 roun\\u2019 from place tuh place lak some uh dese reps follerin\\u2019 uh section gang.\\u201d\\n\\nThe man turned abruptly from his wife and stood in the kitchen door. A blue haze hung over the river and Alfred\\u2019s attention seemed fixed upon this. In reality his thoughts were turned inward. He was thinking of the numerous occasions upon which he and his son had sat on the fallen log at the edge of the water and talked of John\\u2019s proposed travels. He had encouraged his son, given him every advantage his own poor circumstances would permit. And now John was home-tied.\\n\\nThe young man suddenly turned the corner of the house and approached his father.\\n\\n\\u201cHello, papa.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2019Lo, son.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere\\u2019s mamma and Stella?\\u201d\\n\\nThe older man merely jerked his thumb toward the interior of the house and once more gazed pensively toward the river. John entered the kitchen and kissed his mother fondly.\\n\\n\\u201cGreat news, mamma.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat now?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGot a chance to join the Navy, mamma, and go all around the world. Ain\\u2019t that grand?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJohn, you shorely ain\\u2019t gointer leave me an\\u2019 Stella, is yuh?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, I think I am. I know how both of you feel, but I know how I feel, also. You preach to me the gospel of self-sacrifice for the happiness of others, but you are unwilling to practice any of it yourself. Stella can stay here\\u2014I am going to support her and spend all the time I can with her. I am going\\u2014that\\u2019s settled, but I want to go with your good will. I want to do something worthy of a strong man. I have done nothing so far but look to you and papa for everything. Let me learn to strive and think\\u2014in short, be a man.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNaw, John, Ah\\u2019ll nevah give mah consent. I know yous hard-headed jes\\u2019 lak yo\\u2019 paw; but if you leave dis place ovah mah head, Ah nevah wants you tuh come back heah no mo. Ef Ah wuz laid on de coolin\\u2019 board, Ah doan want yuh standin\\u2019 ovah me, young man. Doan even come neah mah grave, you ongrateful wretch!\\u201d\\n\\nMrs. Redding arose and flung out of the room. For once, she was too incensed to cry. John stood in his tracks, gone cold and numb at his mother\\u2019s pronouncement. Alfred, too, was moved. Mrs. Redding banged the bed-room door violently and startled John slightly. Alfred took his son\\u2019s arm, saying softly: \\u201cCome, son, let\\u2019s go down to the river.\\u201d\\n\\nAt the water\\u2019s edge they halted for a short space before seating themselves on the log. The sun was setting in a purple cloud. Hundreds of mosquito hawks darted here and there, catching gnats and being themselves caught by the lightning-swift bullbats. John abstractly snapped in two the stalk of a slender young bamboo. Taking no note of what he was doing, he broke it into short lengths and tossed them singly into the stream. The old man watched him silently for a while, but finally he said: \\u201cOh, yes, my boy, some ships get tangled in the weeds.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, papa, they certainly do. I guess I\\u2019m beaten\\u2014might as well surrender.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNevah say die. Yuh nevah kin tell what will happen.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat can happen? I have courage enough to make things happen; but what can I do against mamma! What man wants to go on a long journey with his mother\\u2019s curses ringing in his ears? She doesn\\u2019t understand. I\\u2019ll wait another year, but I am going because I must.\\u201d\\n\\nAlfred threw an arm about his son\\u2019s neck and drew him nearer but quickly removed it. Both men instantly drew apart, ashamed for having been so demonstrative. The father looked off to the woodlot and asked with a reminiscent smile: \\u201cSon, do you remember showin\\u2019 me the tree dat looked lak a skeleton head?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, I do. It\\u2019s there still. I look at it sometimes when things have become too painful for me at the house, and I run down here to cool off and think. And every time I look at it, papa, it laughs at me like it had some grim joke up its sleeve.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYuh wuz always imaginin\\u2019 things, John; things that nobody else evah thought on!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou know, papa, sometimes\\u2014I reckon my longing to get away makes me feel this way. . . . I feel that I am just earth, soil lying helpless to move myself, but thinking. I seem to hear herds of big beasts like horses and cows thundering over me, and rains beating down; and winds sweeping furiously over\\u2014all acting upon me, but me, well, just soil, feeling but not able to take part in it all. Then a soft wind like love passes over and warms me, and a summer rain comes down like understanding and softens me, and I push a blade of grass or a flower, or maybe a pine tree\\u2014that\\u2019s the ground thinking. Plants are ground thoughts, because the soil can\\u2019t move itself. Whenever I see little whirls of dust sailing down the road I always step aside\\u2014don\\u2019t want to stop \\u2019em \\u2019cause they\\u2019re on their shining way\\u2014moving! Oh, yes, I\\u2019m a dreamer. . . . I have such wonderfully complete dreams, papa. They never come true. But even as my dreams fade I have others.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYas, son, Ah have them same feelings exactly, but Ah can\\u2019t find no words lak you do. It seems lak you an\\u2019 me see wid de same eyes, hear wid de same ears an\\u2019 even feel de same inside. Only thing you kin talk it an\\u2019 Ah can\\u2019t. But anyhow you speaks for me, so whut\\u2019s the difference?\\u201d\\n\\nThe men arose without more conversation. Possibly they feared to trust themselves to speech. As they walked leisurely toward the house Alfred remarked the freshness of the breeze.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s about time the rains set in,\\u201d added his son. \\u201cThe year is wearin\\u2019 on.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter a gloomy supper John strolled out into the spacious front yard and seated himself beneath a China-berry tree. The breeze had grown a trifle stronger since sunset and continued from the south-east. Matty and Stella sat on the deep front porch, but Alfred joined John under the tree. The family was divided into two armed camps and the hostilities had reached that stage where no quarter could be asked or given.\\n\\nAbout nine o\\u2019clock an automobile came flying down the dusty white road and halted at the gate. A white man slammed the gate and hurried up the walk toward the house, but stopped abruptly before the men beneath the China-berry. It was Mr. Hill, the builder of the new bridge that was to span the river.\\n\\n\\u201cHowdy John, Howdy Alf. I\\u2019m mighty glad I found you. I am in trouble.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell now, Mist\\u2019 Hill,\\u201d answered Alfred slowly but pleasantly. \\u201cWe\\u2019se glad you foun\\u2019 us too. What trouble could you be having now?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s the bridge. The weather bureau says that the rains will be upon me in forty-eight hours. If it catches the bridge as it is now, I\\u2019m afraid all my work of the past five months will be swept away, to say nothing of a quarter of a million dollars\\u2019 worth of labor and material. I\\u2019ve got all my men at work now and I thought to get as many extra hands as I could t0 help out tonight and tomorrow. We can make her weather tight in that time if I can get about twenty more.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ll go, Mister Hill,\\u201d said John with a great deal of energy. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want papa out on that bridge\\u2014too dangerous.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGood for you, John!\\u201d cried the white man. \\u201cNow if I had a few more men of your brawn and brain, I could build an entirely new bridge in forty-eight hours. Come on and jump into the car. I am taking the men on down as I find them.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWait a minute. I must put on my blue jeans. I won\\u2019t be long.\\u201d\\n\\nJohn arose and strode to the house. He knew that his mother and wife had overheard everything, but he paused for a moment to speak to them.\\n\\n\\u201cMamma, I am going to work all night on the bridge.\\u201d\\n\\nThere was no answer. He turned to his wife.\\n\\n\\u201cStella, don\\u2019t be lonesome. I will be home at day-break.\\u201d\\n\\nHis wife was as silent as his mother. John stood for a moment on the steps, then resolutely strode past the women and into the house. A few minutes later he emerged clad in his blue overalls and brogans. This time he said nothing to the silent figures rocking back and forth on the porch. But when he was a few feet from the steps he called back: \\u201cBye, mamma; bye, Stella,\\u201d and hurried on down the walk to where his father sat.\\n\\n\\u201cSo long, papa. I\\u2019ll be home around seven.\\u201d\\n\\nAlfred roused himself and stood. Placing both hands upon his son\\u2019s broad shoulders he said softly: \\u201cBe keerful son, don\\u2019t fall or nothin\\u2019.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI will, papa. Don\\u2019t you get into a quarrel on my account.\\u201d\\n\\nJohn hurried on to the waiting car and was whirled away.\\n\\nAlfred sat for a long time beneath the tree where his son had left him and smoked on. The women soon went indoors. On the night breeze were borne numerous scents: of jasmine, of roses, of damp earth of the river, of the pine forest near by. A solitary whip-poor-will sent forth his plaintive call from the nearby shrubbery. A giant owl roared and boomed from the woodlot. The calf confined in the barn would bleat and be answered by his mother\\u2019s sympathetic \\u201cmoo\\u201d from the pen. Away down in Lake Howell Creek the basso profundo of the alligators boomed and died, boomed and died.\\n\\nAround ten o\\u2019clock the breeze freshened, growing stiffer until midnight when it became a gale. Alfred fastened the doors and bolted the wooden shutters at the windows. The three persons sat about a round deal table in the kitchen upon which stood a bulky kerosene lamp, flickering and sputtering in the wind that came in through the numerous cracks in the walls. The wind rushed down the chimney blowing puffs of ashes about the room. It banged the cooking utensils on the walls. The drinking gourd hanging outside by the door played a weird tattoo, hollow and unearthly, against the thin wooden wall.\\n\\nThe man and the women sat silently. Even if there had been no storm they would not have talked. They could not go to bed because the women were afraid to retire during a storm and the man wished to stay awake and think with his son. Thus they sat: the women hot with resentment toward the man and terrified by the storm; the man hardly mindful of the tempest but eating his heart out in pity for his boy. Time wore heavily on.\\n\\nAnd now a new element of terror was added. A screech-owl alighted on the roof and shivered forth his doleful cry. Possibly he had been blown out of his nest by the wind. Matty started up at the sound but fell back in her chair, pale and trembling: \\u201cMy Gawd!\\u201d she gasped, \\u201cdat\\u2019s a sho\\u2019 sign uh death.\\u201d\\n\\nStella hurriedly thrust her hand into the salt-jar and threw some into the chimney of the lamp. The color of the flame changed from yellow to blue-green but this burning of salt did not have the desired effect\\u2014to drive away the bird from the roof. Matty slipped out of her blue calico wrapper and turned it wrong side out before replacing it. Even Alfred turned one sock.\\n\\n\\u201cAlf,\\u201d said Matty, \\u201cwhat do you reckon\\u2019s gonna happen from this?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow do Ah know, Matty?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh wisht John hadn\\u2019t went away from heah tuh night.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHumh.\\u201d\\n\\nOutside the tempest raged. The palms rattled dryly and the giant pines groaned and sighed in the grip of the wind. Flying leaves and pine-mast filled the air. Now and then a brilliant flash of lightning disclosed a bird being blown here and there with the wind. The prodigious roar of the thunder seemed to rock the earth. Black clouds hung so low that the tops of the pines were among them moving slowly before the wind and made the darkness awful. The screech-owl continued his tremulous cry.\\n\\nAfter three o\\u2019clock the wind ceased and the rain commenced. Huge drops clattered down upon the shingle roof like buckshot and ran from the eaves in torrents. It entered the house through the cracks in the walls and under the doors. It was a deluge in volume and force but subsided before morning.\\n\\nThe sun came up brightly on the havoc of the wind and rain calling forth millions of feathered creatures. The white sand everywhere was full of tiny cups dug out by the force of the falling raindrops. The rims of the little depressions crunched noisily underfoot.\\n\\nAt daybreak Mr. Redding set out for the bridge. He was uneasy. On arriving he found that the river had risen twelve feet during the cloudburst and was still rising. The slow St. John was swollen far beyond its banks and rushing on to sea like a mountain stream, sweeping away houses, great blocks of earth, cattle, trees\\u2014in short anything that came within its grasp. Even the steel framework of the new bridge was gone!\\n\\nThe siren of the fibre factory was tied down for half an hour, announcing the disaster to the country side. When Alfred arrived therefore he found nearly all the men of the district there.\\n\\nThe river, red and swollen, was full of floating debris. Huge trees were swept along as relentlessly as chicken coops and fence rails. Some steel piles were all that was left of the bridge.\\n\\nAlfred went down to a group of men who were fishing members of the ill-fated construction gang out of the water. Many were able to swim ashore unassisted. Wagons backed up and were hurriedly driven away loaded with wet shivering men. Two men had been killed outright, others seriously wounded. Three men had been drowned. At last all had been accounted for except John Redding. His father ran here and there asking for him, or calling him. No one knew where he was. No one remembered seeing him since daybreak.\\n\\nDozens of women had arrived at the scene of the disaster by this time. Matty and Stella, wrapped in woolen shawls, were among them. They rushed to Alfred in alarm and asked where was John.\\n\\n\\u201cAh doan know,\\u201d answered Alfred impatiently, \\u201cthat\\u2019s what Ah\\u2019m trying to fin\\u2019 out now.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDo you reckon he\\u2019s run away?\\u201d asked Stella thoughtlessly.\\n\\nMatty bristled instantly.\\n\\n\\u201cNaw,\\u201d she answered sternly, \\u201che ain\\u2019t no sneak.\\u201d\\n\\nThe father turned to Fred Mimms, one of the survivors and asked him where John was and how had the bridge been destroyed.\\n\\n\\u201cYuh see,\\u201d said Mimms, \\u201cwhen dat turrible win\\u2019 come up we wuz out \\u2019bout de middle of de river.

Mebbe he\\u2019s swum ashore, mebbe dey picked him up. What\\u2019s dat floatin\\u2019 way out dere in de water?\\u201d\\n\\nAlfred shaded his eyes with his gnarled brown hand and gazed out into the stream. Sure enough there was a man floating on a piece of timber. He lay prone upon his back. His arms were outstretched, and the water washed over his brogans but his feet were lifted out of the water whenever the timber was buoyed up by the stream. His blue overalls were nearly torn from his body. A heavy piece of steel or timber had struck him in falling for his left side was laid open by the thrust. A great jagged hole wherein the double fists of a man might be thrust, could plainly be seen from the shore. The man was John Redding.\\n\\nEveryone seemed to see him at once. Stella fell to the wet earth in a faint. Matty clung to her husband\\u2019s arm, weeping hysterically. Alfred stood very erect with his wife clinging tearfully to him, but he said nothing. A single tear hung on his lashes for a time then trickled slowly down his wrinkled brown cheek.\\n\\n\\u201cAlf! Alf!\\u201d screamed Matty, \\u201cdere\\u2019s our son. Ah knowed when Ah heard dat owl las\\u2019 night. . . .\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh see \\u2019im, Matty,\\u201d returned her husband softly.\\n\\n\\u201cWhy is yuh standin\\u2019 heah?

I was lying bare-chested in bed, rubbing some gunk from the corner of my right eye. It must have collected while I was sleeping, and to just let it stay there seemed inappropriate. Meanwhile, my left eye was idle, so I gave it the job of looking at my pants. I had taken them off the night before, and now I regretted tossing them so casually over the chair, where they lay wrinkled and crumpled beside my jacket. As my left eye inspected them, I began to wonder whether while sleeping I had shed, snakelike, a layer of skin, for that\\u2019s what my jacket and pants looked like. At this point, a drop of sunshine reached my pant leg; the little splotch of leaping light made me think of a golden flea. And so I felt itchy all over and had my idle left hand make itself useful by scratching.\\n\\nSomeone was knocking on the door.\\n\\nBut who could it be? I was the only person with a reason to come here, and I was already here. So I decided to ignore the knocking and continue with my scratching. Now the door was making a colossal noise, as though it were about to cave in. The person outside, I realized, was knocking not with his hand but with his foot, and, before I had time to think of a response, the door fell to the floor with such a crash that it sent shock waves through me.\\n\\nA brawny fellow with whiskers on his face charged over to my bed. \\u201cYour friend\\u2019s dying, and you\\u2019re still not up?\\u201d he yelled.\\n\\nI\\u2019d never seen this man before. \\u201cHave you come to the wrong address?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cNo chance of that,\\u201d he answered.\\n\\nHis blithe self-assurance made me wonder whether I had somehow gone to sleep in the wrong bed. I jumped up and ran out into the corridor to check the number on the door. But, of course, the door was now lying on the floor of my apartment. On it was written \\u201c26 Hongqiao New Village, Apt. 3.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIs this the door you just kicked down?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, it is,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nSo this was my apartment. \\u201cYou have definitely come to the wrong place,\\u201d I told him.\\n\\nNow it was my confident manner that confused him. He stared at me for a moment. \\u201cAre you or are you not Yu Hua?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, I am,\\u201d I said, \\u201cbut I don\\u2019t know you.\\u201d\\n\\nHe gave a roar of rage. \\u201cYour friend\\u2019s dying!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut I don\\u2019t have any friends!\\u201d I was roaring, too.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s nonsense, you little philistine!\\u201d He glared.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m no philistine,\\u201d I said. \\u201cYou can see the proof of that in the books that fill my room. If you\\u2019re trying to offload this guy on me, I absolutely refuse, because I have never had a single friend. However\\u2014\\u201d I softened my tone. \\u201cHowever, feel free to donate him to my neighbor in Apartment 4. He\\u2019s got a lot of pals and I don\\u2019t think he\\u2019ll mind if you toss in another.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou fickle little philistine!\\u201d He stretched out an arm as thick as my shin and tried to pull my hair.\\n\\nI shrank back to the corner of the bed, shouting desperately, \\u201cI\\u2019m not a philistine\\u2014and I\\u2019ve got the books to prove it.\\u201d\\n\\nWith his firm, cold hand, he grabbed my feeble, warm foot. Then he hauled me out of bed and dumped me on the floor. \\u201cHurry up and get dressed,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOtherwise I\\u2019ll drag you all the way there just as you are.\\u201d\\n\\nI knew it was pointless to argue any further with this guy, because he was at least five times as strong as me. \\u201cSeeing as a dying man wants to see me,\\u201d I told him, \\u201cof course I\\u2019m happy to go.\\u201d\\n\\nSo that was how, on this lousy morning, a muscleman kicked down my door and lumbered me with a friend I had no interest in having\\u2014a friend who was about to die, no less. What\\u2019s more, the north wind was howling like a banshee outside. I had no overcoat or scarf, no gloves or hat\\u2014all I was wearing was a thin jacket as I went off to visit this friend I knew absolutely nothing about.\\n\\nOnce we were in the street, the north wind blew me and the big fellow to the friend\\u2019s house just as quickly as it would blow leaves off a tree. The doorway was piled high with wreaths. The big fellow turned to me and said dolefully, \\u201cYour friend is dead.\\u201d\\n\\nBefore I had time to consider whether this was a cause for rejoicing or for grief, I heard a loud chorus of weeping, toward which the big fellow proceeded to push me.\\n\\nA crowd of tearful men and women surrounded me. \\u201cDon\\u2019t take things so hard,\\u201d they told me solicitously.\\n\\nAll I could do was nod and put on a show of being sad, because now there was no point in saying the things I really wanted to say. I gently patted their shoulders, showing my appreciation for their condolences.\\n\\nThen an old lady tottered forward and grabbed my hand as tears poured down her face. \\u201cMy son is dead,\\u201d she sobbed.\\n\\n\\u201cI know,\\u201d I said. \\u201cI am very sad, because it all happened so suddenly.\\u201d\\n\\nMy comment loosened the floodgates still further, and her wails were now so piercing my hair stood on end.\\n\\n\\u201cPlease don\\u2019t take it so hard,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nHer crying seemed to subside a little and she began to dry her tears with my hand. Then she raised her head and said, \\u201cYou need to take it in stride, too.\\u201d\\n\\nI nodded reassuringly. \\u201cOh, I will do that. We must transform grief into strength.\\u201d\\n\\nShe nodded. \\u201cMy son closed his eyes before you could get here. You don\\u2019t blame him, do you?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, I\\u2019d never do that,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nAgain she fell into a fit of sobbing. After a while she recovered enough to say, \\u201cHe was the only son I had, but he\\u2019s dead. You\\u2019re my son now.\\u201d\\n\\nTugging desperately, I was finally able to retrieve my hand, on the pretext that I needed it to wipe away my own tears, though I had none. Then I said, \\u201cActually, I\\u2019ve thought of you as my mother for a long time now.\\u201d I had no choice but to say that.\\n\\nShe led me to another room, saying, \\u201cGo in and keep my son company for a bit.\\u201d\\n\\nThe room was empty, apart from a dead man lying in a bed under a white shroud. The chair next to the bed seemed to be meant for me, so I sat down.\\n\\nI sat there for a good long time before lifting the shroud to see what the man looked like. I glimpsed a pale face that gave little indication of age, a face I had never seen before. I put the shroud back and thought, So that\\u2019s my friend.\\n\\nThere I sat, next to the corpse whose face I had just seen but instantly forgotten. Although the man\\u2019s death had delivered me from a friendship I refused to recognize, it had not relieved me of my burden, for his mother had simply taken his place: an old woman I did not know had become my mother. It was only too clear what I had to do next: I\\u2019d have to fork out twenty yuan to buy a big wreath; I\\u2019d have to don sackcloth and guard his coffin; I\\u2019d have to weep and wail and parade through the streets with one arm around the cremation urn and the other propping up his mother. And, after all that was over, I\\u2019d have to sweep his grave every April, not to mention carry on his unfinished labors and perform the duties of a filial son.

We\\u2019d been alone in space too long. Back home, we\\u2019d be treated for space sickness and starlust, our brains scanned and studied for signs that our grey matter had deteriorated in the vacuum. We\\u2019d be swaddled in hospitals, kept barefoot and away from the night sky until we stopped dreaming of plumed nebulas and stopped thinking we could hear the music of the spheres in C minor.\\n\\nBut there was no more Earth, and we were lost, limping along to a semi-terraformed planet we were supposed to be studying and would now be colonizing. We\\u2019d taken to talking each other away from the airlock when the stars started looking like houses in the distance and confirming reality as a matter of course. We might all lose our minds, but probably not at the same time.\\n\\n\\u201cDoes this taste like banana?\\u201d Lucinda asked, chewing on a freeze-dried ration. And we\\u2019d all nod.\\n\\n\\u201cI hear someone breathing out there,\\u201d Antin murmured, standing at one of the portholes. And we\\u2019d all say no, it\\u2019s only rock and plasma, come away from there, look at us instead.\\n\\nSo when Carl found the signal and the voice crackled through the speakers, he asked, \\u201cDo you hear a voice?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d said Jane, and Lucinda, and then one by one we all confirmed that we did hear a voice. Muttering, male, half-covered in static. We all bent close to the speakers.\\n\\nThe voice coughed, and paused, and Lucinda covered her mouth.\\n\\nBreath rattled. More words.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s Russian,\\u201d Antin whispered. None of the rest of us spoke it. Hardly anyone in the space programs did anymore. Russia died at the beginning of the slow end. He swayed in time with the enunciation. \\u201cHe says he\\u2019s lost. Over and over. He\\u2019s lost.\\u201d\\n\\nHe grabbed the mic before the rest of us could stop him and broadcast out into the black. \\u201cZdravstvujtye? Zdravstvujtye?\\u201c\\n\\nA pause. We held our breath, our hearts waiting for the next word to start beating again. It had been so long since we\\u2019d savored the sound of a stranger\\u2019s voice.\\n\\nHe began again. The same pattern.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a recording,\\u201d Carl said. He had tears in his eyes. One ended up in his mustache, a shimmer in the energy-efficient lighting.\\n\\nWe let the voice play all night, damn the fuel reserves, damn the razor-thin margins between death and life on a barely-habitable planet.\\n\\nThe next day, we found the ship. Late twentieth century as near as anyone could guess. Our scanners were calibrated for geological identifications only. We didn\\u2019t know what trick of folding space brought it here. The hull was pitted with burn marks and long scratches from debris. It was just big enough for one person who wasn\\u2019t claustrophobic.\\n\\nMatt and Amal volunteered to go aboard. Amal was forty, probably too old to have children when we made landfall. Matt insisted. We could have debated the impact their possible deaths would have on our as-yet-hypothetical colony, but none of the rest of us wanted to stop them. We helped them put on the suits and tethers.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s cold,\\u201d Amal said when she made it aboard. Her chattering teeth made the radio pop. \\u201cThere he is. Look.\\u201d\\n\\nThey had a camera and we tumbled over each other in a mess of arms and legs and sweating palms to get close to the screen. Lucinda and Regan\\u2013who loved each other so secretly that even they didn\\u2019t know it yet\\u2013held onto each other\\u2019s forearms so tight that Lucinda had waning moon scars from Regan\\u2019s nails for the rest of her life. Antin\\u2019s mouth twitched, and we all knew he was aching for the cigarettes he\\u2019d given up to see the stars.\\n\\nAmal held the camera up to where the cosmonaut\\u2019s eyes used to be. He\\u2019d been handsome. He had a vintage face out of the days of Hugo Boss and ships caught in the orbit of a single planet.\\n\\n\\u201cDo you know who he is?\\u201d Carl asked.\\n\\nAntin shook his head. His hands still didn\\u2019t know what to do. \\u201cThere were so many lost in the early days. When my mother was a child, her class listened to the audio of Vladimir Komarov sobbing.\\u201d\\n\\nMatt\\u2019s breath was the rush of the ocean half-remembered. In and out and in and out. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to die up here like that.\\u201d\\n\\nAmal touched the dead man\\u2019s cheek with one gloved finger. With all the air gone, he was a facsimile of human still, even after these hundreds of years. \\u201cHush. We won\\u2019t die. Think of everything that aligned for you to be here, at the right moment and the right velocity, at the same time as he is. We are in the presence of a miracle. Of a universal astronomical improbability. No one is going to die.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t believe in signs,\\u201d Lucinda said from the deck of our ship, with her arms still bleeding in Regan\\u2019s hands. She didn\\u2019t mean it.\\n\\nMatt went to his knees. Amal smoothed her other hand over his helmet and it would have been comforting had they not been separated by six layers of Mylar and mysterious alloys. She kept her other hand on the cosmonaut, and for a moment the dead Earth and the new were separated by only a touch.\\n\\nWe stripped the old ship for precious metals and spare parts, liquefied the body for the carbon. Our fuel reserves rose above the margin of error. We collected the ice crystals from the interior and thrilled at the taste of unfiltered water. It tasted like dust and dirt and everything else we wouldn\\u2019t see again for months.\\n\\nWe kept the recording. Matt played it when we dimmed the lights for nighttime.

She wanted to visit some of her connections in east Tennessee and she was seizing at every chance to change Bailey's mind. Bailey was the son she lived with, her only boy. He was sitting on the edge of his chair at the table, bent over the orange sports section of the Journal. \\\"Now look here, Bailey,\\\" she said, \\\"see here, read this,\\\" and she stood with one hand on her thin hip and the other rattling the newspaper at his bald head. \\\"Here this fellow that calls himself The Misfit is aloose from the Federal Pen and headed toward Florida and you read here what it says he did to these people. Just you read it. I wouldn't take my children in any direction with a criminal like that aloose in it. I couldn't answer to my conscience if I did.\\\"\\n\\nBailey didn't look up from his reading so she wheeled around then and faced the children's mother, a young woman in slacks, whose face was as broad and innocent as a cabbage and was tied around with a green head-kerchief that had two points on the top like rabbit's ears. She was sitting on the sofa, feeding the baby his apricots out of a jar. \\\"The children have been to Florida before,\\\" the old lady said. \\\"You all ought to take them somewhere else for a change so they would see different parts of the world and be broad. They never have been to east Tennessee.\\\"\\n\\nThe children's mother didn't seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, John Wesley, a stocky child with glasses, said, \\\"If you don't want to go to Florida, why dontcha stay at home?\\\" He and the little girl, June Star, were reading the funny papers on the floor.\\n\\n\\\"She wouldn't stay at home to be queen for a day,\\\" June Star said without raising her yellow head.\\n\\n\\\"Yes and what would you do if this fellow, The Misfit, caught you?\\\" the grandmother asked.\\n\\n\\\"I'd smack his face,\\\" John Wesley said.\\n\\n\\\"She wouldn't stay at home for a million bucks,\\\" June Star said. \\\"Afraid she'd miss something. She has to go everywhere we go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right, Miss,\\\" the grandmother said. \\\"Just remember that the next time you want me to curl your hair.\\\"\\n\\nJune Star said her hair was naturally curly.\\n\\nThe next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. She had her big black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it she was hiding a basket with Pitty Sing, the cat, in it. She didn't intend for the cat to be left alone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he might brush against one of the gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. Her son, Bailey, didn't like to arrive at a motel with a cat.\\n\\nShe sat in the middle of the back seat with John Wesley and June Star on either side of her. Bailey and the children's mother and the baby sat in front and they left Atlanta at eight forty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. The grandmother wrote this down because she thought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. It took them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city.\\n\\nThe old lady settled herself comfortably, removing her white cotton gloves and putting them up with her purse on the shelf in front of the back window. The children's mother still had on slacks and still had her head tied up in a green kerchief, but the grandmother had on a navy blue straw sailor hat with a bunch of white violets on the brim and a navy blue dress with a small white dot in the print. Her collars and cuffs were white organdy trimmed with lace and at her neckline she had pinned a purple spray of cloth violets containing a sachet. In case of an accident, anyone seeing her dead on the highway would know at once that she was a lady.\\n\\nShe said she thought it was going to be a good day for driving, neither too hot nor too cold, and she cautioned Bailey that the speed limit was fifty-five miles an hour and that the patrolmen hid themselves behind billboards and small clumps of trees and sped out after you before you had a chance to slow down. She pointed out interesting details of the scenery: Stone Mountain; the blue granite that in some places came up to both sides of the highway; the brilliant red clay banks slightly streaked with purple; and the various crops\\n\\nthat made rows of green lace-work on the ground. The trees were full of silver-white sunlight and the meanest of them sparkled. The children were reading comic magazines and their mother had gone back to sleep.\\n\\n\\\"Let's go through Georgia fast so we won't have to look at it much,\\\" John Wesley said.\\n\\n\\\"If I were a little boy,\\\" said the grandmother, \\\"I wouldn't talk about my native state that way. Tennessee has the mountains and Georgia has the hills.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tennessee is just a hillbilly dumping ground,\\\" John Wesley said, \\\"and Georgia is a lousy state too.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You said it,\\\" June Star said.\\n\\n\\\"In my time,\\\" said the grandmother, folding her thin veined fingers, \\\"children were more respectful of their native states and their parents and everything else. People did right then. Oh look at the cute little pickaninny!\\\" she said and pointed to a Negro child standing in the door of a shack. \\\"Wouldn't that make a picture, now?\\\" she asked and they all turned and looked at the little Negro out of the back window. He waved.\\n\\n\\\"He didn't have any britches on,\\\" June Star said.\\n\\n\\\"He probably didn't have any,\\\" the grandmother explained. \\\"Little niggers in the country don't have things like we do. If I could paint, I'd paint that picture,\\\" she said.\\n\\nThe children exchanged comic books.\\n\\nThe grandmother offered to hold the baby and the children's mother passed him over the front seat to her. She set him on her knee and bounced him and told him about the things they were passing. She rolled her eyes and screwed up her mouth and stuck her leathery thin face into his smooth bland one. Occasionally he gave her a faraway smile. They passed a large cotton field with five or six graves fenced in the middle of it, like a small island. \\\"Look at the graveyard!\\\" the grandmother said, pointing it out. \\\"That was the old family burying ground. That belonged to the plantation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where's the plantation?\\\" John Wesley asked.\\n\\n\\\"Gone With the Wind,\\\" said the grandmother. \\\"Ha. Ha.\\\"\\n\\nWhen the children finished all the comic books they had brought, they opened the lunch and ate it. The grandmother ate a peanut butter sandwich and an olive and would not let\\n\\nthe children throw the box and the paper napkins out the window. When there was nothing else to do they played a game by choosing a cloud and making the other two guess what shape it suggested. John Wesley took one the shape of a cow and June Star guessed a cow and John Wesley said, no, an automobile, and June Star said he didn't play fair, and they began to slap each other over the grandmother.\\n\\nThe grandmother said she would tell them a story if they would keep quiet. When she told a story, she rolled her eyes and waved her head and was very dramatic. She said once when she was a maiden lady she had been courted by a Mr. Edgar Atkins Teagarden from Jasper, Georgia. She said he was a very good-looking man and a gentleman and that he brought her a watermelon every Saturday afternoon with his initials cut in it, E. A. T. Well, one Saturday, she said, Mr. Teagarden brought the watermelon and there was nobody at home and he left it on the front porch and returned in his buggy to Jasper, but she never got the watermelon, she said, because a nigger boy ate it when he saw the initials, E. A. T.! This story tickled John Wesley's funny bone and he giggled and giggled but June Star didn't think it was any good. She said she wouldn't marry a man that just brought her a watermelon on Saturday. The grandmother said she would have done well to marry Mr. Teagarden because he was a gentleman and had bought Coca-Cola stock when it first came out and that he had died only a few years ago, a very wealthy man.\\n\\nThey stopped at The Tower for barbecued sandwiches. The Tower was a part stucco and part wood filling station and dance hall set in a clearing outside of Timothy. A fat man named Red Sammy Butts ran it and there were signs stuck here and there on the building and for miles up and down the highway saying, TRY RED SAMMY'S FAMOUS BARBECUE. NONE LIKE FAMOUS RED SAMMY'S! RED SAM! THE FAT BOY WITH THE HAPPY LAUGH. A VETERAN! RED SAMMY'S YOUR MAN!\\n\\nRed Sammy was lying on the bare ground outside The Tower with his head under a truck while a gray monkey about a foot high, chained to a small chinaberry tree, chattered nearby. The monkey sprang back into the tree and got on the highest limb as soon as he saw the children jump out of the car and run toward him.\\n\\nInside, The Tower was a long dark room with a counter at one end and tables at the other and dancing space in the middle. They all sat down at a board table next to the nickelodeon and Red Sam's wife, a tall burnt-brown woman with hair and eyes lighter than her skin, came and took their order. The children's mother put a dime in the machine and played \\\"The Tennessee Waltz,\\\" and the grandmother said that tune always made her want to dance. She asked Bailey if he would like to dance but he only glared at her. He didn't have a naturally sunny disposition like she did and trips made him nervous. The grandmother's brown eyes were very bright. She swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her chair. June Star said play something she could tap to so the children's mother put in another dime and played a fast number and June Star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap routine.\\n\\n\\\"Ain't she cute?\\\" Red Sam's wife said, leaning over the counter. \\\"Would you like to come be my little girl?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No I certainly wouldn't,\\\" June Star said. \\\"I wouldn't live in a broken-down place like this for a minion bucks!\\\" and she ran back to the table.\\n\\n\\\"Ain't she cute?\\\" the woman repeated, stretching her mouth politely.\\n\\n\\\"Arn't you ashamed?\\\" hissed the grandmother.\\n\\nRed Sam came in and told his wife to quit lounging on the counter and hurry up with these people's order. His khaki trousers reached just to his hip bones and his stomach hung over them like a sack of meal swaying under his shirt. He came over and sat down at a table nearby and let out a combination sigh and yodel. \\\"You can't win,\\\" he said. \\\"You can't win,\\\" and he wiped his sweating red face off with a gray handkerchief. \\\"These days you don't know who to trust,\\\" he said. \\\"Ain't that the truth?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"People are certainly not nice like they used to be,\\\" said the grandmother.\\n\\n\\\"Two fellers come in here last week,\\\" Red Sammy said, \\\"driving a Chrysler. It was a old beat-up car but it was a good one and these boys looked all right to me. Said they worked\\n\\nat the mill and you know I let them fellers charge the gas they bought? Now why did I do that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because you're a good man!\\\" the grandmother said at once.\\n\\n\\\"Yes'm, I suppose so,\\\" Red Sam said as if he were struck with this answer.\\n\\nHis wife brought the orders, carrying the five plates all at once without a tray, two in each hand and one balanced on her arm. \\\"It isn't a soul in this green world of God's that you can trust,\\\" she said. \\\"And I don't count nobody out of that, not nobody,\\\" she repeated, looking at Red Sammy.\\n\\n\\\"Did you read about that criminal, The Misfit, that's escaped?\\\" asked the grandmother.\\n\\n\\\"I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he didn't attact this place right here,\\\" said the woman. \\\"If he hears about it being here,I wouldn't be none surprised to see him. If he hears it's two cent in the cash register, I wouldn't be a tall surprised if he . . .\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That'll do,\\\" Red Sam said. \\\"Go bring these people their Co'-Colas,\\\" and the woman went off to get the rest of the order.\\n\\n\\\"A good man is hard to find,\\\" Red Sammy said. \\\"Every- thing is getting terrible. I remember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more.\\\"\\n\\nHe and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion Europe was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you would think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was exactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the lacy chinaberry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully between his teeth as if it were a delicacy.\\n\\nThey drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grand- mother took cat naps and woke up every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled an old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady. She said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks leading up to it and two little wooden trellis\\n\\narbors on either side in front where you sat down with your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to it. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the more she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin arbors were still standing. \\\"There was a secret panel in this house,\\\" she said craftily, not telling the truth but wishing that she were, \\\"and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in it when Sherman came through but it was never found . . .\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hey!\\\" John Wesley said. \\\"Let's go see it! We'll find it! We'll poke all the woodwork and find it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can't we turn off there?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We never have seen a house with a secret panel!\\\" June Star shrieked. \\\"Let's go to the house with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can't we go see the house with the secret panel!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's not far from here, I know,\\\" the grandmother said. \\\"It wouldn't take over twenty minutes.\\\"\\n\\nBailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. \\\"No,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret panel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother's shoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their vacation, that they could never do what THEY wanted to do. The baby began to scream and John Wesley kicked the back of the seat so hard that his father could feel the blows in his kidney.\\n\\n\\\"All right!\\\" he shouted and drew the car to a stop at the side of the road. \\\"Will you all shut up? Will you all just shut up for one second? If you don't shut up, we won't go anywhere.\\n\\n\\\"It would be very educational for them,\\\" the grandmother murmured.\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" Bailey said, \\\"but get this: this is the only time we're going to stop for anything like this. This is the one and only time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The dirt road that you have to turn down is about a mile back,\\\" the grandmother directed. \\\"I marked it when we passed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A dirt road,\\\" Bailey groaned.\\n\\nAfter they had turned around and were headed toward the dirt road, the grandmother recalled other points about the house, the beautiful glass over the front doorway and the candle-lamp in the hall. John Wesley said that the secret panel was probably in the fireplace.\\n\\n\\\"You can't go inside this house,\\\" Bailey said. \\\"You don't know who lives there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"While you all talk to the people in front, I'll run around behind and get in a window,\\\" John Wesley suggested.\\n\\n\\\"We'll all stay in the car,\\\" his mother said. They turned onto the dirt road and the car raced roughly along in a swirl of pink dust. The grandmother recalled the times when there were no paved roads and thirty miles was a day's journey. The dirt road was hilly and there were sudden washes in it and sharp curves on dangerous embankments. All at once they would be on a hill, looking down over the blue tops of trees for miles around, then the next minute, they would be in a red depression with the dust-coated trees looking down on them.\\n\\n\\\"This place had better turn up in a minute,\\\" Bailey said, \\\"or I'm going to turn around.\\\"\\n\\nThe road looked as if no one had traveled on it in months.\\n\\n\\\"It's not much farther,\\\" the grandmother said and just as she said it, a horrible thought came to her. The thought was so embarrassing that she turned red in the face and her eyes dilated and her feet jumped up, upsetting her valise in the corner. The instant the valise moved, the newspaper top she had over the basket under it rose with a snarl and Pitty Sing,the cat, sprang onto Bailey's shoulder.\\n\\nThe children were thrown to the floor and their mother, clutching the baby, was thrown out the door onto the ground; the old lady was thrown into the front seat. The car turned over once and landed right-side-up in a gulch off the side of the road. Bailey remained in the driver's seat with the cat-gray-striped with a broad white face and an orange nose-clinging to his neck like a caterpillar.\\n\\nAs soon as the children saw they could move their arms and legs, they scrambled out of the car, shouting, \\\"We've had an ACCIDENT!\\\" The grandmother was curled up under the\\n\\ndashboard, hoping she was injured so that Bailey's wrath would not come down on her all at once. The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had remembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee.\\n\\nBailey removed the cat from his neck with both hands and flung it out the window against the side of a pine tree. Then he got out of the car and started looking for the children's mother. She was sitting against the side of the red gutted ditch, holding the screaming baby, but she only had a cut down her face and a broken shoulder. \\\"We've had an ACCIDENT!\\\" the children screamed in a frenzy of delight.\\n\\n\\\"But nobody's killed,\\\" June Star said with disappointment as the grandmother limped out of the car, her hat still pinned to her head but the broken front brim standing up at a jaunty angle and the violet spray hanging off the side. They all sat down in the ditch, except the children, to recover from the shock. They were all shaking.\\n\\n\\\"Maybe a car will come along,\\\" said the children's mother hoarsely.\\n\\n\\\"I believe I have injured an organ,\\\" said the grandmother, pressing her side, but no one answered her. Bailey's teeth were clattering. He had on a yellow sport shirt with bright blue parrots designed in it and his face was as yellow as the l shirt. The grandmother decided that she would not mention that the house was in Tennessee.\\n\\nThe road was about ten feet above and they could see only the tops of the trees on the other side of it. Behind the ditch they were sitting in there were more woods, tall and dark and deep. In a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as if the occupants were watching them. The grandmother stood up and waved both arms dramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared around a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over. It was a big black battered hearse-like automobile. There were three men in it.\\n\\nIt came to a stop just over them and for some minutes, the driver looked down with a steady expressionless gaze to where they were sitting, and didn't speak. Then he turned his\\n\\nhead and muttered something to the other two and they got out. One was a fat boy in black trousers and a red sweat shirt with a silver stallion embossed on the front of it. He moved around on the right side of them and stood staring, his mouth partly open in a kind of loose grin. The other had on khaki pants and a blue striped coat and a gray hat pulled down very low, hiding most of his face. He came around slowly on the left side. Neither spoke.\\n\\nThe driver got out of the car and stood by the side of it, looking down at them. He was an older man than the other two. His hair was just beginning to gray and he wore silver- rimmed spectacles that gave him a scholarly look. He had a long creased face and didn't have on any shirt or undershirt. He had on blue jeans that were too tight for him and was holding a black hat and a gun. The two boys also had guns.\\n\\n\\\"We've had an ACCIDENT!\\\" the children screamed.\\n\\nThe grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she knew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known him au her life but she could not recall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment, placing his feet carefully so that he wouldn't slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks, and his ankles were red and thin. \\\"Good afternoon,\\\" he said. \\\"I see you all had you a little spill.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We turned over twice!\\\" said the grandmother.\\n\\n\\\"Once\\\",\\\" he corrected. \\\"We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram,\\\" he said quietly to the boy with the gray hat.\\n\\n\\\"What you got that gun for?\\\" John Wesley asked. \\\"Whatcha gonna do with that gun?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lady,\\\" the man said to the children's mother, \\\"would you mind calling them children to sit down by you? Children make me nervous. I want all you all to sit down right together there where you're at.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What are you telling US what to do for?\\\" June Star asked.\\n\\nBehind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. \\\"Come here,\\\" said their mother.\\n\\n\\\"Look here now,\\\" Bailey began suddenly, \\\"we're in a predicament! We're in . . .\\\"\\n\\nThe grandmother shrieked. She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. \\\"You're The Misfit!\\\" she said. \\\"I recognized you at once!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes'm,\\\" the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be known, \\\"but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn't of reckernized me.\\\"\\n\\nBailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the children. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened.\\n\\n\\\"Lady,\\\" he said, \\\"don't you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don't mean. I don't reckon he meant to talk to you thataway.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You wouldn't shoot a lady, would you?\\\" the grandmother said and removed a clean handkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.\\n\\nThe Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then covered it up again. \\\"I would hate to have to,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Listen,\\\" the grandmother almost screamed, \\\"I know you're a good man. You don't look a bit like you have com- mon blood. I know you must come from nice people!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes mam,\\\" he said, \\\"finest people in the world.\\\" When he smiled he showed a row of strong white teeth. \\\"God never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy's heart was pure gold,\\\" he said. The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was standing with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. \\\"Watch them children, Bobby Lee,\\\" he said. \\\"You know they make me nervous.\\\" He looked at the six of them huddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn't think of anything to say. \\\"Ain't a cloud in the sky,\\\" he remarked, looking up at it. \\\"Don't see no sun but don't see no cloud neither.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, it's a beautiful day,\\\" said the grandmother. \\\"Listen,\\\" she said, \\\"you shouldn't call yourself The Misfit because I know you're a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hush!\\\" Bailey yelled. \\\"Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!\\\" He was squatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn't move.\\n\\n\\\"I prechate that, lady,\\\" The Misfit said and drew a little circle in the ground with the butt of his gun.\\n\\n\\\"It'll take a half a hour to fix this here car,\\\" Hiram called, looking over the raised hood of it.\\n\\n\\\"Well, first you and Bobby Lee get him and that little boy to step over yonder with you,\\\" The Misfit said, pointing to Bailey and John Wesley. \\\"The boys want to ast you some- thing,\\\" he said to Bailey. \\\"Would you mind stepping back in them woods there with them?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Listen,\\\" Bailey began, \\\"we're in a terrible predicament! Nobody realizes what this is,\\\" and his voice cracked. His eyes were as blue and intense as the parrots in his shirt and he remained perfectly still.\\n\\nThe grandmother reached up to adjust her hat brim as if she were going to the woods with him but it came off in her hand. She stood staring at it and after a second she let it fall on the ground. Hiram pulled Bailey up by the arm as if he were assisting an old man. John Wesley caught hold of his father's hand and Bobby Lee followed. They went off toward the woods and just as they reached the dark edge, Bailey turned and supporting himself against a gray naked pine trunk, he shouted, \\\"I'll be back in a minute, Mamma, wait on me!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come back this instant!\\\" his mother shrilled but they all disappeared into the woods.\\n\\n\\\"Bailey Boy!\\\" the grandmother called in a tragic voice but she found she was looking at The Misfit squatting on the ground in front of her. \\\"I just know you're a good man,\\\" she said desperately. \\\"You're not a bit common!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nome, I ain't a good man,\\\" The Misfit said after a second as if he had considered her statement carefully, \\\"but I ain't the worst in the world neither. My daddy said I was a different breed of dog from my brothers and sisters. 'You know,' Daddy said, 'it's some that can live their whole life out without asking about it and it's others has to know why it is, and this boy is one of the latters. He's going to be into every- thing!'\\\" He put on his black hat and looked up suddenly and then away deep into the woods as if he were embarrassed again. \\\"I'm sorry I don't have on a shirt before you ladies,\\\" he said, hunching his shoulders slightly. \\\"We buried our clothes that we had on when we escaped and we're just\\n\\nmaking do until we can get better. We borrowed these from some folks we met,\\\" he explained.\\n\\n\\\"That's perfectly all right,\\\" the grandmother said. \\\"Maybe Bailey has an extra shirt in his suitcase.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll look and see terrectly,\\\" The Misfit said.\\n\\n\\\"Where are they taking him?\\\" the children's mother screamed.\\n\\n\\\"Daddy was a card himself,\\\" The Misfit said. \\\"You couldn't put anything over on him. He never got in trouble with the Authorities though. Just had the knack of handling them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You could be honest too if you'd only try,\\\" said the grandmother. \\\"Think how wonderful it would be to settle down and live a comfortable life and not have to think about some- body chasing you all the time.\\\"\\n\\nThe Misfit kept scratching in the ground with the butt of his gun as if he were thinking about it. \\\"Yes'm, somebody is always after you,\\\" he murmured.\\n\\nThe grandmother noticed how thin his shoulder blades were just behind-his hat because she was standing up looking down on him. \\\"Do you ever pray?\\\" she asked.\\n\\nHe shook his head. All she saw was the black hat wiggle between his shoulder blades. \\\"Nome,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThere was a pistol shot from the woods, followed closely by another. Then silence. The old lady's head jerked around. She could hear the wind move through the tree tops like a long satisfied insuck of breath. \\\"Bailey Boy!\\\" she called.\\n\\n\\\"I was a gospel singer for a while,\\\" The Misfit said. \\\"I been most everything. Been in the arm service, both land and sea, at home and abroad, been twict married, been an undertaker, been with the railroads, plowed Mother Earth, been in a tornado, seen a man burnt alive oncet,\\\" and he looked up at the children's mother and the little girl who were sitting close together, their faces white and their eyes glassy; \\\"I even seen a woman flogged,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Pray, pray,\\\" the grandmother began, \\\"pray, pray . . .\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I never was a bad boy that I remember of,\\\" The Misfit said in an almost dreamy voice, \\\"but somewheres along the line I done something wrong and got sent to the penitentiary. I was buried alive,\\\" and he looked up and held her attention to him by a steady stare.\\n\\n\\\"That's when you should have started to pray,\\\" she said \\\"What did you do to get sent to the penitentiary that first time?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Turn to the right, it was a wall,\\\" The Misfit said, looking up again at the cloudless sky. \\\"Turn to the left, it was a wall. Look up it was a ceiling, look down it was a floor. I forget what I done, lady. I set there and set there, trying to remember what it was I done and I ain't recalled it to this day. Oncet in a while, I would think it was coming to me, but it never come.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maybe they put you in by mistake,\\\" the old lady said vaguely.\\n\\n\\\"Nome,\\\" he said. \\\"It wasn't no mistake. They had the papers on me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You must have stolen something,\\\" she said.\\n\\nThe Misfit sneered slightly. \\\"Nobody had nothing I wanted,\\\" he said. \\\"It was a head-doctor at the penitentiary said what I had done was kill my daddy but I known that for a lie. My daddy died in nineteen ought nineteen of the epidemic flu and I never had a thing to do with it. He was buried in the Mount Hopewell Baptist churchyard and you can go there and see for yourself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you would pray,\\\" the old lady said, \\\"Jesus would help you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's right,\\\" The Misfit said.\\n\\n\\\"Well then, why don't you pray?\\\" she asked trembling with delight suddenly.\\n\\n\\\"I don't want no hep,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm doing all right by myself.\\\"\\n\\nBobby Lee and Hiram came ambling back from the woods. Bobby Lee was dragging a yellow shirt with bright blue parrots in it.\\n\\n\\\"Thow me that shirt, Bobby Lee,\\\" The Misfit said. The shirt came flying at him and landed on his shoulder and he put it on. The grandmother couldn't name what the shirt reminded her of. \\\"No, lady,\\\" The Misfit said while he was buttoning it up, \\\"I found out the crime don't matter. You can do one thing or you can do another, kill a man or take a tire off his car, because sooner or later you're going to forget what it was you done and just be punished for it.\\\"\\n\\nThe children's mother had begun to make heaving noises as if she couldn't get her breath. \\\"Lady,\\\" he asked, \\\"would you and that little girl like to step off yonder with Bobby Lee and Hiram and join your husband?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, thank you,\\\" the mother said faintly. Her left arm dangled helplessly and she was holding the baby, who had gone to sleep, in the other. \\\"Hep that lady up, Hiram,\\\" The Misfit said as she struggled to climb out of the ditch, \\\"and Bobby Lee, you hold onto that little girl's hand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't want to hold hands with him,\\\" June Star said. \\\"He reminds me of a pig.\\\"\\n\\nThe fat boy blushed and laughed and caught her by the arm and pulled her off into the woods after Hiram and her mother.\\n\\nAlone with The Misfit, the grandmother found that she had lost her voice. There was not a cloud in the sky nor any sun. There was nothing around her but woods. She wanted to tell him that he must pray. She opened and closed her mouth several times before anything came out. Finally she found herself saying, \\\"Jesus. Jesus,\\\" meaning, Jesus will help you, but the way she was saying it, it sounded as if she might be cursing.\\n\\n\\\"Yes'm,\\\" The Misfit said as if he agreed. \\\"Jesus shown everything off balance. It was the same case with Him as with me except He hadn't committed any crime and they could prove I had committed one because they had the papers on me. Of course,\\\" he said, \\\"they never shown me my papers. That's why I sign myself now. I said long ago, you get you a signature and sign everything you do and keep a copy of it. Then you'll know what you done and you can hold up the crime to the punishment and see do they match and in the end you'll have something to prove you ain't been treated right. I call myself The Misfit,\\\" he said, \\\"because I can't make what all I done wrong fit what all I gone through in punishment.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a piercing scream from the woods, followed closely by a pistol report. \\\"Does it seem right to you, lady, that one is punished a heap and another ain't punished at all?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Jesus!\\\" the old lady cried. \\\"You've got good blood! I know you wouldn't shoot a lady! I know you come from nice people! Pray! Jesus, you ought not to shoot a lady. I'll give you all the money I've got!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lady,\\\" The Misfit said, looking beyond her far into the woods, \\\"there never was a body that give the undertaker a tip.\\\"\\n\\nThere were two more pistol reports and the grandmother raised her head like a parched old turkey hen crying for water and called, \\\"Bailey Boy, Bailey Boy!\\\" as if her heart would break.\\n\\n\\\"Jesus was the only One that ever raised the dead,\\\" The Misfit continued, \\\"and He shouldn't have done it. He shown everything off balance. If He did what He said, then it's nothing for you to do but thow away everything and follow Him, and if He didn't, then it's nothing for you to do but enjoy the few minutes you got left the best way you can-by killing somebody or burning down his house or doing some other meanness to him. No pleasure but meanness,\\\" he said and his voice had become almost a snarl.\\n\\n\\\"Maybe He didn't raise the dead,\\\" the old lady mumbled, not knowing what she was saying and feeling so dizzy that she sank down in the ditch with her legs twisted under her.\\n\\n\\\"I wasn't there so I can't say He didn't,\\\" The Misfit said. \\\"I wisht I had of been there,\\\" he said, hitting the ground with his fist. \\\"It ain't right I wasn't there because if I had of been there I would of known. Listen lady,\\\" he said in a high voice, \\\"if I had of been there I would of known and I wouldn't be like I am now.\\\" His voice seemed about to crack and the grandmother's head cleared for an instant.

The story begins with the grandmother trying to convince her son, Bailey, to change their vacation plans to Florida and go to Tennessee instead, due to her fear of a criminal called The Misfit who has escaped from prison and is heading towards Florida. Despite her efforts, the family continues their journey towards Florida.\\n\\nDuring the car ride, the grandmother engages in a conversation with her grandchildren, John Wesley and June Star, about the criminal, and they express their lack of concern. They mock their grandmother's worry and imply that she wouldn't stay at home even if The Misfit were to catch her. As they continue driving, the grandmother tells stories and tries to engage the family, all while worrying about the escaped criminal.\\n\\nEventually, the family stops at a restaurant called The Tower, where they have a tense encounter with Red Sammy Butts, the owner, who laments about the lack of trustworthiness in people. The grandmother mentions the criminal, and Red Sammy becomes concerned about their safety. They leave the restaurant and continue their journey.\\n\\nWhile on the road, the grandmother suddenly recalls a house in Tennessee that she wants to visit. She convinces Bailey to take a detour and visit the house, but along the way, she realizes that the house is actually in Tennessee, not Georgia. Distressed, she keeps this information to herself.\\n\\nAs they drive on a remote dirt road, the grandmother becomes increasingly anxious about the destination, and Bailey, frustrated with her, loses control of the car and it overturns in a ditch. Moments later, a car approaches them, and three men, including The Misfit, get out. The grandmother recognizes The Misfit and panics, trying to reason with him and impress upon him that he is a good man with good blood. The Misfit and his accomplices take Bailey and his son, John Wesley, into the woods, leaving the grandmother alone with The Misfit. She continues to plead for her life, even referring to The Misfit as one of her own children.\\n\\nThe Misfit becomes agitated and shoots the grandmother three times. He then orders his accomplices to take the grandmother's body to where they had taken Bailey and John Wesley. The story concludes with The Misfit reflecting on the grandmother's talkative nature and her fascination with him before leaving the scene.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"In the short story \\\"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\\\" by Flannery O'Connor, the Grandmother insists on taking a trip to east Tennessee instead of going to Florida with her son Bailey and his family. She argues with Bailey over a newspaper article that mentions an escaped criminal called The Misfit heading towards Florida. The Grandmother fears that he might harm her family, but Bailey dismisses her concerns.\\n\\nThey set off on the car trip, and along the way, the Grandmother reminisces about her past and continuously tries to convince Bailey to take the detour to see an old plantation house. The children, John Wesley and June Star, are disinterested and ask her why she doesn't just stay home if she doesn't want to go to Florida.\\n\\nThe family stops at a roadside diner called The Tower, and they encounter a man named Red Sammy Butts. Red Sammy complains about how the world has gotten worse with dishonest people and reflects on a recent incident where two strangers tricked him into giving them money for gas. The Grandmother tells Red Sammy about an escaped criminal on the loose, but he dismisses her warnings.\\n\\nBack on the road, the Grandmother unknowingly causes an accident by startling the family cat, Pitty Sing, who leaps onto Bailey's shoulder, distracting him. The car overturns, and they are stranded in the middle of nowhere.\\n\\nAs they wait for someone to help, a car with three men arrives. The leader is The Misfit, the escaped criminal the Grandmother had warned them about. The family is led into the woods with him, leaving Bailey and his son unarmed. The Grandmother tries to initiate a conversation about religion and goodness with The Misfit while subtly trying to convince him not to harm her family. Meanwhile, the other two men, Bobby Lee and Hiram, take Bailey and the young boy into the woods separately.\\n\\nUltimately, The Misfit ends up shooting the entire family, starting with the Grandmother. The story ends with The Misfit reflecting on his actions and the difficult questions about goodness, faith, and humanity that his encounter with the family raises.\\n\\nThroughout the story, O'Connor explores themes of violence, manipulation, and redemption as she delves into the complex motivations of her characters. The Grandmother, in her self-absorption and insistence on doing as she pleases, ends up inadvertently leading her family into the hands of dangerous individuals. Conversely, The Misfit is portrayed as a complex character, capable of glimpses of self-awareness and grappling with questions of morality.

An uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces.\\nThe former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back drawing-room. Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all the rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers. Among these I found a few paper-covered books, the pages of which were curled and damp: The Abbot, by Walter Scott, The Devout Communicant, and The Memoirs of Vidocq. I liked the last best because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house contained a central apple-tree and a few straggling bushes, under one of which I found the late tenant's rusty bicycle-pump. He had been a very charitable priest; in his will he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of his house to his sister.\\nWhen the short days of winter came, dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinners. When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the silent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses, where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness. When we returned to the street, light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner, we hid in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan's sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea, we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan's steps resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her before he obeyed, and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body, and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side.\\nEvery morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood.\\nHer image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance. On Saturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I had to go to carry some of the parcels. We walked through the flaring streets, jostled by drunken men and bargaining women, amid the curses of labourers, the shrill litanies of shop-boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs' cheeks, the nasal chanting of street-singers, who sang a come-all-you about O'Donovan Rossa, or a ballad about the troubles in our native land. These noises converged in a single sensation of life for me: I imagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes. Her name sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and praises which I myself did not understand. My eyes were often full of tears I could not tell why and at times a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out into my bosom. I thought little of the future. I did not know whether I would ever speak to her or not or, if I spoke to her, how I could tell her of my confused adoration. But my body was like a harp and her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the wires.\\nOne evening I went into the back drawing-room in which the priest had died. It was a dark rainy evening and there was no sound in the house. Through one of the broken panes I heard the rain impinge upon the earth, the fine incessant needles of water playing in the sodden beds. Some distant lamp or lighted window gleamed below me. I was thankful that I could see so little. All my senses seemed to desire to veil themselves and, feeling that I was about to slip from them, I pressed the palms of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: 'O love! O love!' many times.\\nAt last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me was I going to Araby. I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It would be a splendid bazaar; she said she would love to go.\\n'And why can't you?' I asked.\\nWhile she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist. She could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week in her convent. Her brother and two other boys were fighting for their caps, and I was alone at the railings. She held one of the spikes, bowing her head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one side of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible as she stood at ease.\\n'It's well for you,' she said.\\n'If I go,' I said, 'I will bring you something.'\\nWhat innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts after that evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening days. I chafed against the work of school. At night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came between me and the page I strove to read. The syllables of the word Araby were called to me through the silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment over me. I asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night. My aunt was surprised, and hoped it was not some Freemason affair. I answered few questions in class. I watched my master's face pass from amiability to sternness; he hoped I was not beginning to idle. I could not call my wandering thoughts together. I had hardly any patience with the serious work of life which, now that it stood between me and my desire, seemed to me child's play, ugly monotonous child's play.\\nOn Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to the bazaar in the evening. He was fussing at the hallstand, looking for the hat-brush, and answered me curtly:\\n'Yes, boy, I know.'\\nAs he was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour and lie at the window. I felt the house in bad humour and walked slowly towards the school. The air was pitilessly raw and already my heart misgave me.\\nWhen I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home. Still it was early. I sat staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking began to irritate me, I left the room. I mounted the staircase and gained the upper part of the house. The high, cold, empty, gloomy rooms liberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front window I saw my companions playing below in the street. Their cries reached me weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the cool glass, I looked over at the dark house where she lived. I may have stood there for an hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress.\\nWhen I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at the fire. She was an old, garrulous woman, a pawnbroker's widow, who collected used stamps for some pious purpose. I had to endure the gossip of the tea-table. The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come. Mrs Mercer stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn't wait any longer, but it was after eight o'clock and she did not like to be out late, as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone I began to walk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said:\\n'I'm afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord.'\\nAt nine o'clock I heard my uncle's latchkey in the hall door. I heard him talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had received the weight of his overcoat. I could interpret these signs. When he was midway through his dinner I asked him to give me the money to go to the bazaar. He had forgotten.\\n'The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,' he said.\\nI did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically:\\n'Can't you give him the money and let him go? You've kept him late enough as it is.'\\nMy uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he believed in the old saying: 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.' He asked me where I was going and, when I told him a second time, he asked me did I know The Arab's Farewell to his Steed. When I left the kitchen he was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt.\\nI held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street towards the station. The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled to me the purpose of my journey. I took my seat in a third-class carriage of a deserted train. After an intolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly. It crept onward among ruinous houses and over the twinkling river. At Westland Row Station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors; but the porters moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the bazaar. I remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the train drew up beside an improvised wooden platform. I passed out on to the road and saw by the lighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me was a large building which displayed the magical name.\\nI could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the bazaar would be closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile, handing a shilling to a weary-looking man. I found myself in a big hall girded at half its height by a gallery. Nearly all the stalls were closed and the greater part of the hall was in darkness. I recognized a silence like that which pervades a church after a service. I walked into the centre of the bazaar timidly. A few people were gathered about the stalls which were still open. Before a curtain, over which the words Caf\\u00e9 Chantant were written in coloured lamps, two men were counting money on a salver. I listened to the fall of the coins.\\nRemembering with difficulty why I had come, I went over to one of the stalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered tea-sets. At the door of the stall a young lady was talking and laughing with two young gentlemen. I remarked their English accents and listened vaguely to their conversation.\\n'O, I never said such a thing!'\\n'O, but you did!'\\n'O, but I didn't!'\\n'Didn't she say that?'\\n'Yes. I heard her.'\\n'O, there's a. . . fib!'\\nObserving me, the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy anything. The tone of her voice was not encouraging; she seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense of duty. I looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern guards at either side of the dark entrance to the stall and murmured:\\n'No, thank you.'\\nThe young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to the two young men. They began to talk of the same subject. Once or twice the young lady glanced at me over her shoulder.\\nI lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make my interest in her wares seem the more real. Then I turned away slowly and walked down the middle of the bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to fall against the sixpence in my pocket. I heard a voice call from one end of the gallery that the light was out. The upper part of the hall was now completely dark.\\nGazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story is set in North Richmond Street, a quiet street where the Christian Brothers' School releases the boys at the end of the day.

This one is so very old that I cannot understand how it has clung so vividly and tenaciously to my memory. Since then I have seen so many sinister things, either affecting or terrible, that I am astonished at not being able to pass a single day without the face of Mother Bellflower recurring to my mind's eye, just as I knew her formerly long, long ago, when I was ten or twelve years old.\\nShe was an old seamstress who came to my parents' house once a week, every Thursday, to mend the linen. My parents lived in one of those country houses called chateaux, which are merely old houses with pointed roofs, to which are attached three or four adjacent farms.\\nThe village, a large village, almost a small market town, was a few hundred yards off and nestled round the church, a red brick church, which had become black with age.\\nWell, every Thursday Mother Bellflower came between half-past six and seven in the morning and went immediately into the linen room and began to work. She was a tall, thin, bearded or rather hairy woman, for she had a beard all over her face, a surprising, an unexpected beard, growing in improbable tufts, in curly bunches which looked as if they had been sown by a madman over that great face, the face of a gendarme in petticoats. She had them on her nose, under her nose, round her nose, on her chin, on her cheeks, and her eyebrows, which were extraordinarily thick and long and quite gray, bushy and bristling, looked exactly like a pair of mustaches stuck on there by mistake.\\nShe limped, not like lame people generally do, but like a ship pitching. When she planted her great bony, vibrant body on her sound leg, she seemed to be preparing to mount some enormous wave, and then suddenly she dipped as if to disappear in an abyss and buried herself in the ground. Her walk reminded one of a ship in a storm, and her head, which was always covered with an enormous white cap, whose ribbons fluttered down her back, seemed to traverse the horizon from north to south and from south to north at each limp.\\nI adored Mother Bellflower. As soon as I was up I used to go into the linen room, where I found her installed at work with a foot warmer under her feet. As soon as I arrived she made me take the foot warmer and sit upon it, so that I might not catch cold in that large chilly room under the roof.\\n\\\"That draws the blood from your head,\\\" she would say to me.\\nShe told me stories while mending the linen with her long, crooked, nimble fingers; behind her magnifying spectacles, for age had impaired her sight, her eyes appeared enormous to me, strangely profound, double.\\nAs far as I can remember from the things which she told me and by which my childish heart was moved, she had the large heart of a poor woman. She told me what had happened in the village, how a cow had escaped from the cow house and had been found the next morning in front of Prosper Malet's mill looking at the sails turning, or about a hen's egg which had been found in the church belfry without anyone being able to understand what creature had been there to lay it, or the queer story of Jean Pila's dog who had gone ten leagues to bring back his master's breeches which a tramp had stolen while they were hanging up to dry out of doors after he had been caught in the rain. She told me these simple adventures in such a manner that in my mind they assumed the proportions of never-to-be-forgotten dramas, of grand and mysterious poems; and the ingenious stories invented by the poets, which my mother told me in the evening, had none of the flavor, none of the fullness or of the vigor of the peasant woman's narratives.\\nWell, one Thursday when I had spent all the morning in listening to Mother Clochette, I wanted to go upstairs to her again during the day after picking hazelnuts with the manservant in the wood behind the farm. I remember it all as clearly as what happened only yesterday.\\nOn opening the door of the linen room I saw the old seamstress lying on the floor by the side of her chair, her face turned down and her arms stretched out, but still holding her needle in one hand and one of my shirts in the other. One of her legs in a blue stocking, the longer one no doubt, was extended under her chair, and her spectacles glistened by the wall, where they had rolled away from her.\\nI ran away uttering shrill cries. They all came running, and in a few minutes I was told that Mother Clochette was dead.\\nI cannot describe the profound, poignant, terrible emotion which stirred my childish heart.

Suddenly someone came in with a lamp--without seeing me, however--and heard my father and mother talking with the medical man, whose voice recognized.\\nHe had been sent for immediately, and he was explaining the cause of the accident, of which I understood nothing, however.

Feeling sure that he would be caught, the young schoolmaster lost his presence of mind and replied stupidly: 'I came up here to rest a little among the bundles of hay, Monsieur Grabu.'\\n\\\"The loft was very large and absolutely dark.

The old banker was walking up and down his study and remembering how, fifteen years before, he had given a party one autumn evening. There had been many clever men there, and there had been interesting conversations. Among other things they had talked of capital punishment. The majority of the guests, among whom were many journalists and intellectual men, disapproved of the death penalty. They considered that form of punishment out of date, immoral, and unsuitable for Christian States. In the opinion of some of them the death penalty ought to be replaced everywhere by imprisonment for life.\\n\\\"I don't agree with you,\\\" said their host the banker. \\\"I have not tried either the death penalty or imprisonment for life, but if one may judge _a priori_, the death penalty is more moral and more humane than imprisonment for life. Capital punishment kills a man at once, but lifelong imprisonment kills him slowly. Which executioner is the more humane, he who kills you in a few minutes or he who drags the life out of you in the course of many years?\\\"\\n\\\"Both are equally immoral,\\\" observed one of the guests, \\\"for they both have the same object -- to take away life. The State is not God. It has not the right to take away what it cannot restore when it wants to.\\\"\\nAmong the guests was a young lawyer, a young man of five-and-twenty. When he was asked his opinion, he said:\\n\\\"The death sentence and the life sentence are equally immoral, but if I had to choose between the death penalty and imprisonment for life, I would certainly choose the second. To live anyhow is better than not at all.\\\"\\nA lively discussion arose. The banker, who was younger and more nervous in those days, was suddenly carried away by excitement; he struck the table with his fist and shouted at the young man:\\n\\\"It's not true! I'll bet you two millions you wouldn't stay in solitary confinement for five years.\\\"\\n\\\"If you mean that in earnest,\\\" said the young man, \\\"I'll take the bet, but I would stay not five but fifteen years.\\\"\\n\\\"Fifteen? Done!\\\" cried the banker. \\\"Gentlemen, I stake two millions!\\\"\\n\\\"Agreed! You stake your millions and I stake my freedom!\\\" said the young man.\\nAnd this wild, senseless bet was carried out! The banker, spoilt and frivolous, with millions beyond his reckoning, was delighted at the bet. At supper he made fun of the young man, and said:\\n\\\"Think better of it, young man, while there is still time. To me two millions are a trifle, but you are losing three or four of the best years of your life. I say three or four, because you won't stay longer. Don't forget either, you unhappy man, that voluntary confinement is a great deal harder to bear than compulsory. The thought that you have the right to step out in liberty at any moment will poison your whole existence in prison. I am sorry for you.\\\"\\nAnd now the banker, walking to and fro, remembered all this, and asked himself: \\\"What was the object of that bet? What is the good of that man's losing fifteen years of his life and my throwing away two millions? Can it prove that the death penalty is better or worse than imprisonment for life? No, no. It was all nonsensical and meaningless. On my part it was the caprice of a pampered man, and on his part simple greed for money. . . .\\\"\\nThen he remembered what followed that evening. It was decided that the young man should spend the years of his captivity under the strictest supervision in one of the lodges in the banker's garden. It was agreed that for fifteen years he should not be free to cross the threshold of the lodge, to see human beings, to hear the human voice, or to receive letters and newspapers. He was allowed to have a musical instrument and books, and was allowed to write letters, to drink wine, and to smoke. By the terms of the agreement, the only relations he could have with the outer world were by a little window made purposely for that object. He might have anything he wanted -- books, music, wine, and so on -- in any quantity he desired by writing an order, but could only receive them through the window. The agreement provided for every detail and every trifle that would make his imprisonment strictly solitary, and bound the young man to stay there _exactly_ fifteen years, beginning from twelve o'clock of November 14, 1870, and ending at twelve o'clock of November 14, 1885. The slightest attempt on his part to break the conditions, if only two minutes before the end, released the banker from the obligation to pay him two millions.\\nFor the first year of his confinement, as far as one could judge from his brief notes, the prisoner suffered severely from loneliness and depression. The sounds of the piano could be heard continually day and night from his lodge. He refused wine and tobacco. Wine, he wrote, excites the desires, and desires are the worst foes of the prisoner; and besides, nothing could be more dreary than drinking good wine and seeing no one. And tobacco spoilt the air of his room. In the first year the books he sent for were principally of a light character; novels with a complicated love plot, sensational and fantastic stories, and so on.\\nIn the second year the piano was silent in the lodge, and the prisoner asked only for the classics. In the fifth year music was audible again, and the prisoner asked for wine. Those who watched him through the window said that all that year he spent doing nothing but eating and drinking and lying on his bed, frequently yawning and angrily talking to himself. He did not read books. Sometimes at night he would sit down to write; he would spend hours writing, and in the morning tear up all that he had written. More than once he could be heard crying.\\nIn the second half of the sixth year the prisoner began zealously studying languages, philosophy, and history. He threw himself eagerly into these studies -- so much so that the banker had enough to do to get him the books he ordered. In the course of four years some six hundred volumes were procured at his request. It was during this period that the banker received the following letter from his prisoner:\\n\\\"My dear Jailer, I write you these lines in six languages. Show them to people who know the languages. Let them read them. If they find not one mistake I implore you to fire a shot in the garden. That shot will show me that my efforts have not been thrown away. The geniuses of all ages and of all lands speak different languages, but the same flame burns in them all. Oh, if you only knew what unearthly happiness my soul feels now from being able to understand them!\\\" The prisoner's desire was fulfilled. The banker ordered two shots to be fired in the garden.\\nThen after the tenth year, the prisoner sat immovably at the table and read nothing but the Gospel. It seemed strange to the banker that a man who in four years had mastered six hundred learned volumes should waste nearly a year over one thin book easy of comprehension. Theology and histories of religion followed the Gospels.\\nIn the last two years of his confinement the prisoner read an immense quantity of books quite indiscriminately. At one time he was busy with the natural sciences, then he would ask for Byron or Shakespeare. There were notes in which he demanded at the same time books on chemistry, and a manual of medicine, and a novel, and some treatise on philosophy or theology. His reading suggested a man swimming in the sea among the wreckage of his ship, and trying to save his life by greedily clutching first at one spar and then at another.\\nII\\nThe old banker remembered all this, and thought:\\n\\\"To-morrow at twelve o'clock he will regain his freedom. By our agreement I ought to pay him two millions. If I do pay him, it is all over with me: I shall be utterly ruined.\\\"\\nFifteen years before, his millions had been beyond his reckoning; now he was afraid to ask himself which were greater, his debts or his assets. Desperate gambling on the Stock Exchange, wild speculation and the excitability which he could not get over even in advancing years, had by degrees led to the decline of his fortune and the proud, fearless, self-confident millionaire had become a banker of middling rank, trembling at every rise and fall in his investments. \\\"Cursed bet!\\\" muttered the old man, clutching his head in despair \\\"Why didn't the man die? He is only forty now. He will take my last penny from me, he will marry, will enjoy life, will gamble on the Exchange; while I shall look at him with envy like a beggar, and hear from him every day the same sentence: 'I am indebted to you for the happiness of my life, let me help you!' No, it is too much! The one means of being saved from bankruptcy and disgrace is the death of that man!\\\"\\nIt struck three o'clock, the banker listened; everyone was asleep in the house and nothing could be heard outside but the rustling of the chilled trees. Trying to make no noise, he took from a fireproof safe the key of the door which had not been opened for fifteen years, put on his overcoat, and went out of the house.\\nIt was dark and cold in the garden. Rain was falling. A damp cutting wind was racing about the garden, howling and giving the trees no rest. The banker strained his eyes, but could see neither the earth nor the white statues, nor the lodge, nor the trees. Going to the spot where the lodge stood, he twice called the watchman. No answer followed. Evidently the watchman had sought shelter from the weather, and was now asleep somewhere either in the kitchen or in the greenhouse.\\n\\\"If I had the pluck to carry out my intention,\\\" thought the old man, \\\"Suspicion would fall first upon the watchman.\\\"\\nHe felt in the darkness for the steps and the door, and went into the entry of the lodge. Then he groped his way into a little passage and lighted a match. There was not a soul there. There was a bedstead with no bedding on it, and in the corner there was a dark cast-iron stove. The seals on the door leading to the prisoner's rooms were intact.\\nWhen the match went out the old man, trembling with emotion, peeped through the little window. A candle was burning dimly in the prisoner's room. He was sitting at the table. Nothing could be seen but his back, the hair on his head, and his hands. Open books were lying on the table, on the two easy-chairs, and on the carpet near the table.\\nFive minutes passed and the prisoner did not once stir. Fifteen years' imprisonment had taught him to sit still. The banker tapped at the window with his finger, and the prisoner made no movement whatever in response. Then the banker cautiously broke the seals off the door and put the key in the keyhole. The rusty lock gave a grating sound and the door creaked. The banker expected to hear at once footsteps and a cry of astonishment, but three minutes passed and it was as quiet as ever in the room. He made up his mind to go in.\\nAt the table a man unlike ordinary people was sitting motionless. He was a skeleton with the skin drawn tight over his bones, with long curls like a woman's and a shaggy beard. His face was yellow with an earthy tint in it, his cheeks were hollow, his back long and narrow, and the hand on which his shaggy head was propped was so thin and delicate that it was dreadful to look at it. His hair was already streaked with silver, and seeing his emaciated, aged-looking face, no one would have believed that he was only forty. He was asleep. . . . In front of his bowed head there lay on the table a sheet of paper on which there was something written in fine handwriting.\\n\\\"Poor creature!\\\" thought the banker, \\\"he is asleep and most likely dreaming of the millions. And I have only to take this half-dead man, throw him on the bed, stifle him a little with the pillow, and the most conscientious expert would find no sign of a violent death. But let us first read what he has written here. . . .\\\"\\nThe banker took the page from the table and read as follows:\\n\\\"To-morrow at twelve o'clock I regain my freedom and the right to associate with other men, but before I leave this room and see the sunshine, I think it necessary to say a few words to you. With a clear conscience I tell you, as before God, who beholds me, that I despise freedom and life and health, and all that in your books is called the good things of the world.\\n\\\"For fifteen years I have been intently studying earthly life. It is true I have not seen the earth nor men, but in your books I have drunk fragrant wine, I have sung songs, I have hunted stags and wild boars in the forests, have loved women. . . . Beauties as ethereal as clouds, created by the magic of your poets and geniuses, have visited me at night, and have whispered in my ears wonderful tales that have set my brain in a whirl. In your books I have climbed to the peaks of Elburz and Mont Blanc, and from there I have seen the sun rise and have watched it at evening flood the sky, the ocean, and the mountain-tops with gold and crimson. I have watched from there the lightning flashing over my head and cleaving the storm-clouds. I have seen green forests, fields, rivers, lakes, towns. I have heard the singing of the sirens, and the strains of the shepherds' pipes; I have touched the wings of comely devils who flew down to converse with me of God. . . . In your books I have flung myself into the bottomless pit, performed miracles, slain, burned towns, preached new religions, conquered whole kingdoms. . . .\\n\\\"Your books have given me wisdom. All that the unresting thought of man has created in the ages is compressed into a small compass in my brain. I know that I am wiser than all of you.\\n\\\"And I despise your books, I despise wisdom and the blessings of this world. It is all worthless, fleeting, illusory, and deceptive, like a mirage. You may be proud, wise, and fine, but death will wipe you off the face of the earth as though you were no more than mice burrowing under the floor, and your posterity, your history, your immortal geniuses will burn or freeze together with the earthly globe.\\n\\\"You have lost your reason and taken the wrong path. You have taken lies for truth, and hideousness for beauty. You would marvel if, owing to strange events of some sorts, frogs and lizards suddenly grew on apple and orange trees instead of fruit, or if roses began to smell like a sweating horse; so I marvel at you who exchange heaven for earth. I don't want to understand you.\\n\\\"To prove to you in action how I despise all that you live by, I renounce the two millions of which I once dreamed as of paradise and which now I despise. To deprive myself of the right to the money I shall go out from here five hours before the time fixed, and so break the compact. . . .\\\"\\nWhen the banker had read this he laid the page on the table, kissed the strange man on the head, and went out of the lodge, weeping. At no other time, even when he had lost heavily on the Stock Exchange, had he felt so great a contempt for himself. When he got home he lay on his bed, but his tears and emotion kept him for hours from sleeping.\\nNext morning the watchmen ran in with pale faces, and told him they had seen the man who lived in the lodge climb out of the window into the garden, go to the gate, and disappear. The banker went at once with the servants to the lodge and made sure of the flight of his prisoner. To avoid arousing unnecessary talk, he took from the table the writing in which the millions were renounced, and when he got home locked it up in the fireproof safe.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story begins with a discussion between a group of individuals regarding the death penalty and life imprisonment.

The whole region was sparsely settled by people of the frontier--restless souls who no sooner had hewn fairly habitable homes out of the wilderness and attained to that degree of prosperity which today we should call indigence, than, impelled by some mysterious impulse of their nature, they abandoned all and pushed farther westward, to encounter new perils and privations in the effort to regain the meager comforts which they had voluntarily renounced. Many of them had already forsaken that region for the remoter settlements, but among those remaining was one who had been of those first arriving. He lived alone in a house of logs surrounded on all sides by the great forest, of whose gloom and silence he seemed a part, for no one had ever known him to smile nor speak a needless word. His simple wants were supplied by the sale or barter of skins of wild animals in the river town, for not a thing did he grow upon the land which, if needful, he might have claimed by right of undisturbed possession. There were evidences of \\\"improvement\\\"--a few acres of ground immediately about the house had once been cleared of its trees, the decayed stumps of which were half concealed by the new growth that had been suffered to repair the ravage wrought by the ax. Apparently the man's zeal for agriculture had burned with a failing flame, expiring in penitential ashes.\\nThe little log house, with its chimney of sticks, its roof of warping clapboards weighted with traversing poles and its \\\"chinking\\\" of clay, had a single door and, directly opposite, a window. The latter, however, was boarded up--nobody could remember a time when it was not. And none knew why it was so closed; certainly not because of the occupant's dislike of light and air, for on those rare occasions when a hunter had passed that lonely spot the recluse had commonly been seen sunning himself on his doorstep if heaven had provided sunshine for his need. I fancy there are few persons living today who ever knew the secret of that window, but I am one, as you shall see.\\nThe man's name was said to be Murlock. He was apparently seventy years old, actually about fifty. Something besides years had had a hand in his aging. His hair and long, full beard were white, his gray, lusterless eyes sunken, his face singularly seamed with wrinkles which appeared to belong to two intersecting systems. In figure he was tall and spare, with a stoop of the shoulders--a burden bearer. I never saw him; these particulars I learned from my grandfather, from whom also I got the man's story when I was a lad. He had known him when living near by in that early day.\\nOne day Murlock was found in his cabin, dead. It was not a time and place for coroners and newspapers, and I suppose it was agreed that he had died from natural causes or I should have been told, and should remember. I know only that with what was probably a sense of the fitness of things the body was buried near the cabin, alongside the grave of his wife, who had preceded him by so many years that local tradition had retained hardly a hint of her existence. That closes the final chapter of this true story--excepting, indeed, the circumstance that many years afterward, in company with an equally intrepid spirit, I penetrated to the place and ventured near enough to the ruined cabin to throw a stone against it, and ran away to avoid the ghost which every well-informed boy thereabout knew haunted the spot. But there is an earlier chapter--that supplied by my grandfather.\\nWhen Murlock built his cabin and began laying sturdily about with his ax to hew out a farm--the rifle, meanwhile, his means of support--he was young, strong and full of hope. In that eastern country whence he came he had married, as was the fashion, a young woman in all ways worthy of his honest devotion, who shared the dangers and privations of his lot with a willing spirit and light heart. There is no known record of her name; of her charms of mind and person tradition is silent and the doubter is at liberty to entertain his doubt; but God forbid that I should share it! Of their affection and happiness there is abundant assurance in every added day of the man's widowed life; for what but the magnetism of a blessed memory could have chained that venturesome spirit to a lot like that?\\nOne day Murlock returned from gunning in a distant part of the forest to find his wife prostrate with fever, and delirious. There was no physician within miles, no neighbor; nor was she in a condition to be left, to summon help. So he set about the task of nursing her back to health, but at the end of the third day she fell into unconsciousness and so passed away, apparently, with never a gleam of returning reason.\\nFrom what we know of a nature like his we may venture to sketch in some of the details of the outline picture drawn by my grandfather. When convinced that she was dead, Murlock had sense enough to remember that the dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty he blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others which he did correctly were done over and over. His occasional failures to accomplish some simple and ordinary act filled him with astonishment, like that of a drunken man who wonders at the suspension of familiar natural laws. He was surprised, too, that he did not weep--surprised and a little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead. \\\"Tomorrow,\\\" he said aloud, \\\"I shall have to make the coffin and dig the grave; and then I shall miss her, when she is no longer in sight; but now--she is dead, of course, but it is all right--it must be all right, somehow. Things cannot be so bad as they seem.\\\"\\nHe stood over the body in the fading light, adjusting the hair and putting the finishing touches to the simple toilet, doing all mechanically, with soulless care. And still through his consciousness ran an undersense of conviction that all was right--that he should have her again as before, and everything explained. He had had no experience in grief; his capacity had not been enlarged by use. His heart could not contain it all, nor his imagination rightly conceive it. He did not know he was so hard struck; that knowledge would come later, and never go. Grief is an artist of powers as various as the instruments upon which he plays his dirges for the dead, evoking from some the sharpest, shrillest notes, from others the low, grave chords that throb recurrent like the slow beating of a distant drum. Some natures it startles; some it stupefies. To one it comes like the stroke of an arrow, stinging all the sensibilities to a keener life; to another as the blow of a bludgeon, which in crushing benumbs. We may conceive Murlock to have been that way affected, for and here we are upon surer ground than that of conjecture no sooner had he finished his pious work than, sinking into a chair by the side of the table upon which the body lay, and noting how white the profile showed in the deepening gloom, he laid his arms upon the table's edge, and dropped his face into them, tearless yet and unutterably weary. At that moment came in through the open window a long, wailing sound like the cry of a lost child in the far deeps of the darkening woods! But the man did not move. Again, and nearer than before, sounded that unearthly cry upon his failing sense. Perhaps it was a wild beast; perhaps it was a dream. For Murlock was asleep.\\nSome hours later, as it afterward appeared, this unfaithful watcher awoke and lifting his head from his arms intently listened--he knew not why. There in the black darkness by the side of the dead, recalling all without a shock, he strained his eyes to see--he knew not what. His senses were all alert, his breath was suspended, his blood had stilled its tides as if to assist the silence. Who--what had waked him, and where was it?\\nSuddenly the table shook beneath his arms, and at the same moment he heard, or fancied that he heard, a light, soft step--another--sounds as of bare feet upon the floor!\\nHe was terrified beyond the power to cry out or move. Perforce he waited--waited there in the darkness through seeming centuries of such dread as one may know, yet live to tell. He tried vainly to speak the dead woman's name, vainly to stretch forth his hand across the table to learn if she were there. His throat was powerless, his arms and hands were like lead. Then occurred something most frightful. Some heavy body seemed hurled against the table with an impetus that pushed it against his breast so sharply as nearly to overthrow him, and at the same instant he heard and felt the fall of something upon the floor with so violent a thump that the whole house was shaken by the impact. A scuffling ensued, and a confusion of sounds impossible to describe. Murlock had risen to his feet. Fear had by excess forfeited control of his faculties. He flung his hands upon the table. Nothing was there!\\nThere is a point at which terror may turn to madness; and madness incites to action. With no definite intent, from no motive but the wayward impulse of a madman, Murlock sprang to the wall, with a little groping seized his loaded rifle, and without aim discharged it. By the flash which lit up the room with a vivid illumination, he saw an enormous panther dragging the dead woman toward the window, its teeth fixed in her throat! Then there were darkness blacker than before, and silence; and when he returned to consciousness the sun was high and the wood vocal with songs of birds.\\nThe body lay near the window, where the beast had left it when frightened away by the flash and report of the rifle. The clothing was deranged, the long hair in disorder, the limbs lay anyhow. From the throat, dreadfully lacerated, had issued a pool of blood not yet entirely coagulated. The ribbon with which he had bound the wrists was broken; the hands were tightly clenched. Between the teeth was a fragment of the animal's ear.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In 1830, in a remote forest near Cincinnati, lived a reclusive man named Murlock.

Many years later, the narrator and a friend visited the site, and it was rumored that Murlock's ghost haunted the area.\\n\\nThe narrator's grandfather, who had lived nearby, revealed the first part of Murlock's life story. Earlier in his life, Murlock had come to the area with his wife from eastern states to settle in the wilderness. They built a cabin together, with Murlock working as a hunter to support them.\\n\\nHowever, tragedy struck when Murlock's wife fell ill with a fever and eventually died. Murlock took on the responsibility of preparing her body and burying her, although he did this mechanically, and it didn't seem to affect him emotionally.\\n\\nIn a weary state, he collapsed at the table next to her. As he was about to fall asleep, he heard a wailing cry, but he felt too exhausted to investigate. Later in the night, he woke when he heard footsteps and felt the table shake. Terrified, he realized something was in his cabin. Suddenly, a heavy object collided against the table and he heard a thud as something fell to the floor, causing a commotion. When he gained the confidence to stand up, he found nothing on the table.\\n\\nMurlock grabbed his rifle and, without aiming, shot it blindly into the room. In the flash of gunfire, he saw an enormous panther dragging his wife's dead body towards the window, with its teeth still latched onto her throat. Darkness fell, and when he woke up, the sun was shining and the sounds of birds filled the air. The panther had fled, leaving Murlock surrounded by his disheveled wife's broken body.\\n\\nAmongst the turmoil, Murlock discovered part of the panther's ear inside his wife's mouth.\", \"story_token_count\": 2433, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 617, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 563}, {\"Title\": \"A Burlesque Biography\", \"Author\": \"Mark Twain\", \"story\": \"Two or three persons having at different times intimated that if I would write an autobiography they would read it when they got leisure, I yield at last to this frenzied public demand and herewith tender my history.\\nOurs is a noble house, and stretches a long way back into antiquity. The earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of was a friend of the family by the name of Higgins. This was in the eleventh century, when our people were living in Aberdeen, county of Cork, England. Why it is that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name except when one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert foolishness, instead of Higgins, is a mystery which none of us has ever felt much desire to stir. It is a kind of vague, pretty romance, and we leave it alone. All the old families do that way.\\nArthour Twain was a man of considerable note--a solicitor on the highway in William Rufus's time. At about the age of thirty he went to one of those fine old English places of resort called Newgate, to see about something, and never returned again. While there he died suddenly.\\nAugustus Twain seems to have made something of a stir about the year 1160. He was as full of fun as he could be, and used to take his old saber and sharpen it up, and get in a convenient place on a dark night, and stick it through people as they went by, to see them jump. He was a born humorist. But he got to going too far with it; and the first time he was found stripping one of these parties, the authorities removed one end of him, and put it up on a nice high place on Temple Bar, where it could contemplate the people and have a good time. He never liked any situation so much or stuck to it so long.\\nThen for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a succession of soldiers--noble, high-spirited fellows, who always went into battle singing, right behind the army, and always went out a-whooping, right ahead of it.\\nThis is a scathing rebuke to old dead Froissart's poor witticism that our family tree never had but one limb to it, and that that one stuck out at right angles, and bore fruit winter and summer.\\nEarly in the fifteenth century we have Beau Twain, called \\\"the Scholar.\\\" He wrote a beautiful, beautiful hand. And he could imitate anybody's hand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off to see it. He had infinite sport with his talent. But by and by he took a contract to break stone for a road, and the roughness of the work spoiled his hand. Still, he enjoyed life all the time he was in the stone business, which, with inconsiderable intervals, was some forty-two years. In fact, he died in harness. During all those long years he gave such satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week till the government gave him another. He was a perfect pet. And he was always a favorite with his fellow-artists, and was a conspicuous member of their benevolent secret society, called the Chain Gang. He always wore his hair short, had a preference for striped clothes, and died lamented by the government. He was a sore loss to his country. For he was so regular.\\nSome years later we have the illustrious John Morgan Twain. He came over to this country with Columbus in 1492 as a passenger. He appears to have been of a crusty, uncomfortable disposition. He complained of the food all the way over, and was always threatening to go ashore unless there was a change. He wanted fresh shad. Hardly a day passed over his head that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air, sneering about the commander, and saying he did not believe Columbus knew where he was going to or had ever been there before. The memorable cry of \\\"Land ho!\\\" thrilled every heart in the ship but his. He gazed awhile through a piece of smoked glass at the penciled line lying on the distant water, and then said: \\\"Land be hanged--it's a raft!\\\"\\nWhen this questionable passenger came on board the ship, be brought nothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked \\\"B. G.,\\\" one cotton sock marked \\\"L. W. C.,\\\" one woolen one marked \\\"D. F.,\\\" and a night-shirt marked \\\"O. M. R.\\\" And yet during the voyage he worried more about his \\\"trunk,\\\" and gave himself more airs about it, than all the rest of the passengers put together. If the ship was \\\"down by the head,\\\" and would not steer, he would go and move his \\\"trunk\\\" further aft, and then watch the effect. If the ship was \\\"by the stern,\\\" he would suggest to Columbus to detail some men to \\\"shift that baggage.\\\" In storms he had to be gagged, because his wailings about his \\\"trunk\\\" made it impossible for the men to hear the orders. The man does not appear to have been openly charged with any gravely unbecoming thing, but it is noted in the ship's log as a \\\"curious circumstance\\\" that albeit he brought his baggage on board the ship in a newspaper, he took it ashore in four trunks, a queensware crate, and a couple of champagne baskets. But when he came back insinuating, in an insolent, swaggering way, that some of this things were missing, and was going to search the other passengers' baggage, it was too much, and they threw him overboard. They watched long and wonderingly for him to come up, but not even a bubble rose on the quietly ebbing tide. But while every one was most absorbed in gazing over the side, and the interest was momentarily increasing, it was observed with consternation that the vessel was adrift and the anchor-cable hanging limp from the bow. Then in the ship's dimmed and ancient log we find this quaint note:\\n\\\"In time it was discouvered yt ye troblesome passenger hadde gone downe and got ye anchor, and toke ye same and solde it to ye dam sauvages from ye interior, saying yt he hadde founde it, ye sonne of a ghun!\\\"\\nYet this ancestor had good and noble instincts, and it is with pride that we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who ever interested himself in the work of elevating and civilizing our Indians. He built a commodious jail and put up a gallows, and to his dying day he claimed with satisfaction that he had had a more restraining and elevating influence on the Indians than any other reformer that ever labored among them. At this point the chronicle becomes less frank and chatty, and closes abruptly by saying that the old voyager went to see his gallows perform on the first white man ever hanged in America, and while there received injuries which terminated in his death.\\nThe great-grandson of the \\\"Reformer\\\" flourished in sixteen hundred and something, and was known in our annals as \\\"the old Admiral,\\\" though in history he had other titles. He was long in command of fleets of swift vessels, well armed and manned, and did great service in hurrying up merchantmen. Vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on, always made good fair time across the ocean. But if a ship still loitered in spite of all he could do, his indignation would grow till he could contain himself no longer-- and then he would take that ship home where he lived and keep it there carefully, expecting the owners to come for it, but they never did. And he would try to get the idleness and sloth out of the sailors of that ship by compelling them to take invigorating exercise and a bath. He called it \\\"walking a plank.\\\" All the pupils liked it. At any rate, they never found any fault with it after trying it. When the owners were late coming for their ships, the Admiral always burned them, so that the insurance money should not be lost. At last this fine old tar was cut down in the fullness of his years and honors. And to her dying day, his poor heart-broken widow believed that if he had been cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been resuscitated.\\nCharles Henry Twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenth century, and was a zealous and distinguished missionary. He converted sixteen thousand South Sea islanders, and taught them that a dog-tooth necklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come to divine service in. His poor flock loved him very, very dearly; and when his funeral was over, they got up in a body and came out of the restaurant with tears in their eyes, and saying, one to another, that he was a good tender missionary, and they wished they had some more of him.\\nPah-go-to-wah-wah-pukketekeewis Mighty-Hunter-with-a-Hog-Eye-Twain adorned the middle of the eighteenth century, and aided General Braddock with all his heart to resist the oppressor Washington. It was this ancestor who fired seventeen times at our Washington from behind a tree. So far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral story-books is correct; but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenth round the awe-stricken savage said solemnly that that man was being reserved by the Great Spirit for some mighty mission, and he dared not lift his sacrilegious rifle against him again, the narrative seriously impairs the integrity of history. What he did say was:\\n\\\"It ain't no hic no use. 'At man's so drunk he can't stan' still long enough for a man to hit him. I hic I can't 'ford to fool away any more am'nition on him.\\\"\\nThat was why he stopped at the seventeenth round, and it was a good, plain, matter-of-fact reason, too, and one that easily commends itself to us by the eloquent, persuasive flavor of probability there is about it.\\nI also enjoyed the story-book narrative, but I felt a marring misgiving that every Indian at Braddock's Defeat who fired at a soldier a couple of times two easily grows to seventeen in a century, and missed him, jumped to the conclusion that the Great Spirit was reserving that soldier for some grand mission; and so I somehow feared that the only reason why Washington's case is remembered and the others forgotten is, that in his the prophecy came true, and in that of the others it didn't. There are not books enough on earth to contain the record of the prophecies Indians and other unauthorized parties have made; but one may carry in his overcoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have been fulfilled.\\nI will remark here, in passing, that certain ancestors of mine are so thoroughly well-known in history by their aliases, that I have not felt it to be worth while to dwell upon them, or even mention them in the order of their birth. Among these may be mentioned Richard Brinsley Twain, alias Guy Fawkes; John Wentworth Twain, alias Sixteen-String Jack; William Hogarth Twain, alias Jack Sheppard; Ananias Twain, alias Baron Munchausen; John George Twain, alias Captain Kydd; and then there are George Francis Twain, Tom Pepper, Nebuchadnezzar, and Baalam's Ass--they all belong to our family, but to a branch of it somewhat distinctly removed from the honorable direct line--in fact, a collateral branch, whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that, in order to acquire the notoriety we have always yearned and hungered for, they have got into a low way of going to jail instead of getting hanged.\\nIt is not well, when writing an autobiography, to follow your ancestry down too close to your own time--it is safest to speak only vaguely of your great-grandfather, and then skip from there to yourself, which I now do.\\nI was born without teeth--and there Richard III. had the advantage of me; but I was born without a humpback, likewise, and there I had the advantage of him. My parents were neither very poor nor conspicuously honest.\\nBut now a thought occurs to me. My own history would really seem so tame contrasted with that of my ancestors, that it is simply wisdom to leave it unwritten until I am hanged. If some other biographies I have read had stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred, it would have been a felicitous thing for the reading public. How does it strike you?\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The narrator, who remains unnamed, begins their autobiography by acknowledging that they have decided to write their life story based on the requests of a few people who have expressed interest in reading it. They mention that their family, the Twains, dates back to the eleventh century in Aberdeen, England. The earliest known ancestor, a man named Higgins, was a friend of the family. The narrator explains that the Twains have mostly used their maternal name throughout history, with a few exceptions when some family members used aliases. The reason for this tradition is unclear, but the family finds it to be a romantic mystery and does not question it.\\n\\nThe narrator then recounts the stories of various ancestors. Arthour Twain, a man who lived in William Rufus's time, was a solicitor on the highway. However, he disappeared when he went to Newgate, a place of resort, and was found dead there. Augustus Twain, who lived around 1160, was known for his sense of humor. He would play pranks on people by sticking his saber through them in the dark to scare them. However, he took his pranks too far and was eventually caught and punished by having one of his limbs put on display.\\n\\nThe next two hundred years of the family's history were filled with soldiers who were brave and high-spirited. They always went into battle singing and went out victoriously. This is in contrast to a joke made by Froissart, who said that the family tree only had one limb sticking out at right angles and bore fruit all year round.\\n\\nIn the fifteenth century, the family had a member named Beau Twain, who was known as \\\"the Scholar.\\\" He had exceptional handwriting skills and could imitate other people's handwriting perfectly. However, he eventually took a job breaking rocks for a road, which ruined his hands. He continued to enjoy life and work in the stone business until his death. He was well-liked and respected by his fellow-workers and was a prominent member of their secret society called the Chain Gang.\\n\\nThe narrator then mentions another relative, John Morgan Twain, who traveled to America with Columbus in 1492. He was a difficult passenger, constantly complaining about the food and doubting Columbus' abilities. When they reached land, he dismissed it as a raft. He brought only a few items on board the ship, but when they arrived ashore, he claimed that some of his belongings were missing and insisted on searching the other passengers' baggage. The irritated passengers threw him overboard, and as they looked for him to resurface, they noticed that the ship was adrift because he had taken the anchor and sold it to Native Americans.\\n\\nDespite his skills as a troublemaker, the narrator points out that this particular ancestor had good intentions and was the first white person to attempt to civilize Native Americans. He built a jail and a gallows and claimed to have a great influence on the native population. However, he died after attending the hanging of the first white man in America.\\n\\nThe next notable ancestor mentioned is Charles Henry Twain, who lived in the late seventeenth century and was a missionary. He converted many South Sea islanders and taught them the proper way to dress for church. His funeral was deeply mourned by his flock, who expressed their love and admiration for him.\\n\\nPah-go-to-wah-wah-pukketekeewis Mighty-Hunter-with-a-Hog-Eye-Twain lived in the mid-eighteenth century and was present at Braddock's Defeat, a battle between British and French forces during the French and Indian War. He famously fired at George Washington seventeen times but missed. The ancestor is often credited with saying that he believed the Great Spirit was protecting Washington and therefore could not shoot him. However, the narrator suggests that the real reason for Pah-go-to-wah-wah-pukketekeewis stopping at the seventeenth shot was because he believed Washington was too drunk to hit and did not want to waste any more ammunition.\\n\\nThe narrator briefly mentions other ancestors who are well-known historical figures such as Guy Fawkes, Sixteen-String Jack, and Jack Sheppard, among others. These ancestors took a somewhat less honorable path, often getting into trouble with the law.\\n\\nThe narrator concludes by stating that they find their own life story to be ordinary compared to the exploits of their ancestors. Therefore, they believe it is best to leave their own autobiography unwritten until they are hanged. They also suggest that other biographies should have stopped after discussing the ancestry, as it would have been more interesting for readers.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"The story begins with the narrator's acknowledgment of his willingness to write an autobiography at the request of a few individuals. He then delves into the history of his noble family lineage, starting in Aberdeen, county of Cork, England, in the 11th century. The protagonist, Augustus Twain, is described as a man of humor and mischief during the 12th century. However, his pranks become troublesome, resulting in his death after being caught stripping someone.\\n\\nThe family line then becomes filled with soldiers who go into battle fearlessly and always emerge victorious. The narrator proudly states that this assertion counters the mocking comment from Froissart regarding the family having a single branch holding fruit year-round.b;j'h\\n\\nThe fifteenth century introduces Beau Twain, acclaimed for his ability to mimic handwriting but having his own talent ruined due to his time in the stone business. However, he continued to enjoy life, always prompt in completing his work for the government.\\n\\nNext, the story introduces an ancestor named John Morgan Twain, who notoriously doubted Christopher Columbus and was unsatisfied with the quality of food during a voyage. He ends his journey disapprovingly, stating that it could have simply been a raft, contrary to the discovery proclaimed by the crew. John Morgan Twain also displays eccentricities in carrying just a minimal amount of personal belongings. Upon returning to the ship, disappointed by the loss of some belongings, he conducts misguided searches leading to him being thrown overboard.\\n\\nThe ancestor Charles Henry Twain was a zealous and respected missionary in the late 17th century.

Due to his humorous departure from battle, it was concluded that the \\\"Great Spirit\\\" had reserved Washington for an exceptional mission. The narrator questions this narrative's accuracy, suggesting that Native Americans likely jumped to the prophecy conclusion undeservingly.\\n\\nThe autobiography detours briefly to mention elusive ancestors who largely differ from the main family line due to their criminal activities, citation examples being Richard Brinsley Twain, alias Guy Fawkes; John Wentworth Twain, alias Sixteen-String Jack; William Hogarth Twain, alias Jack Sheppard, etc.\\n\\nMoving closer to his own story, the narrator mentions being born without teeth, contrasting with Richard III, and without a humpback, giving him an advantage over the English king. He describes his parents as moderately wealthy and not particularly moral.\\n\\nHowever, the narrator contemplates whether his own life story is worth recounting, feeling that it pales in comparison to the extraordinary tales of his ancestors.

You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was a point definitely settled--but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.\\nIt must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good-will. I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.\\nHe had a weak point--this Fortunato--although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity--to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack--but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: I was skillful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.\\nIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting party-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.\\nI said to him: \\\"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\\\"\\n\\\"How?\\\" said he. \\\"Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival!\\\"\\n\\\"I have my doubts,\\\" I replied; \\\"and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\\\"\\n\\\"Amontillado!\\\"\\n\\\"I have my doubts.\\\"\\n\\\"Amontillado!\\\"\\n\\\"And I must satisfy them.\\\"\\n\\\"Amontillado!\\\"\\n\\\"As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a critical turn, it is he. He will tell me-- \\\"\\n\\\"Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\\\"\\n\\\"And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.\\\"\\n\\\"Come, let us go.\\\"\\n\\\"Whither?\\\"\\n\\\"To your vaults.\\\"\\n\\\"My friend, no. I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you have an engagement. Luchesi--\\\"\\n\\\"I have no engagement--come.\\\"\\n\\\"My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.\\\"\\n\\\"Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.\\\"\\nThus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask of black silk, and drawing a roquelaure closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.\\nThere were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.\\nI took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.\\nThe gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.\\n\\\"The pipe,\\\" said he.\\n\\\"It is farther on,\\\" said I; \\\"but observe the white webwork which gleams from these cavern walls.\\\"\\nHe turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.\\n\\\"Nitre?\\\" he asked, at length.\\n\\\"Nitre,\\\" I replied. \\\"How long have you had that cough?\\\"\\n\\\"Ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh!\\\"\\nMy poor friend found it impossible to reply. for many minutes.\\n\\\"It is nothing,\\\" he said at last.\\n\\\"Come,\\\" I said, with decision, \\\"we will go back; your health is precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is Luchesi--\\\"\\n\\\"Enough,\\\" he said: \\\"the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I shall not die of a cough.\\\"\\n\\\"True--true.\\\" I replied; \\\"and indeed, I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.\\\"\\nHere I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.\\n\\\"Drink,\\\" I said, presenting him the wine.\\nHe raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.\\n\\\"I drink,\\\" he said, \\\"to the buried that repose around us.\\\"\\n\\\"And I to your long life.\\\"\\nHe again took my arm, and we proceeded.\\n\\\"These vaults,\\\" he said, \\\"are extensive.\\\"\\n\\\"The Montresors,\\\" I replied, \\\"were a great and numerous family.\\\"\\n\\\"I forget your arms.\\\"\\n\\\"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are embedded in the heel.\\\"\\n\\\"And the motto?\\\"\\n\\\"Nemo me impune lacessit.\\\"\\n\\\"Good!\\\" he said.\\nThe wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.\\n\\\"The nitre!\\\" I said; \\\"see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the vaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough--\\\"\\n\\\"It is nothing,\\\" he said; \\\"let us go on. But first, another draught of the Medoc.\\\"\\nI broke and reached him a flagon of De Gr\\u00e2ve. He emptied it at a breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed, and threw the bottle upward with a gesticulation I did not understand.\\nI looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.\\n\\\"You do not comprehend?\\\" he said.\\n\\\"Not I,\\\" I replied.\\n\\\"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\\\"\\n\\\"How?\\\"\\n\\\"You are not of the masons.\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, yes,\\\" I said, \\\"yes, yes.\\\"\\n\\\"You? Impossible! A mason?\\\"\\n\\\"A mason,\\\" I replied.\\n\\\"A sign,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"It is this,\\\" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaure.\\n\\\"You jest,\\\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. \\\"But let us proceed to the Amontillado.\\\"\\n\\\"Be it so,\\\" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and, descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.\\nAt the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones we perceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.\\nIt was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored to pry into the depth of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.\\n\\\"Proceed,\\\" I said; \\\"herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi--\\\"\\n\\\"He is an ignoramus,\\\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key, I stepped back from the recess.\\n\\\"Pass your hand,\\\" I said, \\\"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre. Indeed it is very damp. Once more let me implore you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power.\\\"\\n\\\"The Amontillado!\\\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.\\n\\\"True,\\\" I replied; \\\"the Amontillado.\\\"\\nAs I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building-stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.\\nI had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was not the cry of a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the masonwork, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.\\nA succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a brief moment I hesitated--I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him who clamoured. I re\\u00ebchoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamourer grew still.\\nIt was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice said:\\n\\\"Ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he! he!--over our wine--he! he! he!\\\"\\n\\\"The Amontillado!\\\" I said.\\n\\\"He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado. But is it not getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo--the Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.\\\"\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" I said, \\\"let us be gone.\\\"\\n\\\"For the love of God, Montresor!\\\"\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" I said, \\\"for the love of God!\\\"\\nBut to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I called aloud:\\n\\\"Fortunato!\\\"\\nNo answer. I called again:\\n\\\"Fortunato!\\\"\\nNo answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick--on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I hastened to make an end of my labour. I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re\\u00ebrected the old rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them.

The protagonist flatters Fortunato's rival, Luchesi, and says he will ask him to taste the wine instead, but Fortunato insists on going.\\n\\nThe narrator leads Fortunato through his empty home, grabs torches, and they descend into the catacombs. As they go deeper, Fortunato's drunkenness becomes more apparent, but the protagonist keeps offering him wine to keep him going. They reach a small, private crypt, and Fortunato is chained to the wall. It is revealed that the protagonist has been planning this revenge for a long time and that his friendly demeanor was just a facade. He starts to brick up the entrance of the crypt, trapping Fortunato inside.\\n\\nAs the protagonist walls up the entrance, Fortunato sobers up and becomes terrified. He pleads for mercy, but the protagonist continues to build the wall, mocking Fortunato's fear.

Then, holding it in front of his eyes, he let the light from the lamp stream through it, smelled it, tasted a few drops and smacked his lips with relish. Then he said:\\n\\\"Ah! the charming poison! Or rather the seductive murderer, the delightful destroyer of peoples!\\n\\\"You people do not know it the way I do. You may have read that admirable book entitled L'Assommoir, but you have not, as I have, seen alcohol exterminate a whole tribe of savages, a little kingdom of negroes--alcohol calmly unloaded by the barrel by red-bearded English seamen.\\n\\\"Right near here, in a little village in Brittany near Pont-l'Abbe, I once witnessed a strange and terrible tragedy caused by alcohol. I was spending my vacation in a little country house left me by my father. You know this flat coast where the wind whistles day and night, where one sees, standing or prone, these giant rocks which in the olden times were regarded as guardians, and which still retain something majestic and imposing about them. I always expect to see them come to life and start to walk across the country with the slow and ponderous tread of giants, or to unfold enormous granite wings and fly toward the paradise of the Druids.\\n\\\"Everywhere is the sea, always ready on the slightest provocation to rise in its anger and shake its foamy mane at those bold enough to brave its wrath.\\n\\\"And the men who travel on this terrible sea, which, with one motion of its green back, can overturn and swallow up their frail barks--they go out in the little boats, day and night, hardy, weary and drunk. They are often drunk. They have a saying which says: 'When the bottle is full you see the reef, but when it is empty you see it no more.'\\n\\\"Go into one of their huts; you will never find the father there. If you ask the woman what has become of her husband, she will stretch her arms out over the dark ocean which rumbles and roars along the coast. He remained, there one night, when he had had too much to drink; so did her oldest son. She has four more big, strong, fair-haired boys. Soon it will be their time.\\n\\\"As I said, I was living in a little house near Pont-l'Abbe. I was there alone with my servant, an old sailor, and with a native family which took care of the grounds in my absence. It consisted of three persons, two sisters and a man, who had married one of them, and who attended to the garden.\\n\\\"A short time before Christmas my gardener's wife presented him with a boy. The husband asked me to stand as god-father. I could hardly deny the request, and so he borrowed ten francs from me for the cost of the christening, as he said.\\n\\\"The second day of January was chosen as the date of the ceremony. For a week the earth had been covered by an enormous white carpet of snow, which made this flat, low country seem vast and limitless. The ocean appeared to be black in contrast with this white plain; one could see it rolling, raging and tossing its waves as though wishing to annihilate its pale neighbor, which appeared to be dead, it was so calm, quiet and cold.\\n\\\"At nine o'clock the father, Kerandec, came to my door with his sister-in-law, the big Kermagan, and the nurse, who carried the infant wrapped up in a blanket. We started for the church. The weather was so cold that it seemed to dry up the skin and crack it open. I was thinking of the poor little creature who was being carried on ahead of us, and I said to myself that this Breton race must surely be of iron, if their children were able, as soon as they were born, to stand such an outing.\\n\\\"We came to the church, but the door was closed; the priest was late.\\n\\\"Then the nurse sat down on one of the steps and began to undress the child. At first I thought there must have been some slight accident, but I saw that they were leaving the poor little fellow naked completely naked, in the icy air. Furious at such imprudence, I protested:\\n\\\"'Why, you are crazy! You will kill the child!'\\n\\\"The woman answered quietly: 'Oh, no, sir; he must wait naked before the Lord.'\\n\\\"The father and the aunt looked on undisturbed. It was the custom. If it were not adhered to misfortune was sure to attend the little one.\\n\\\"I scolded, threatened and pleaded. I used force to try to cover the frail creature. All was in vain. The nurse ran away from me through the snow, and the body of the little one turned purple. I was about to leave these brutes when I saw the priest coming across the country, followed by the sexton and a young boy. I ran towards him and gave vent to my indignation. He showed no surprise nor did he quicken his pace in the least. He answered:\\n\\\"'What can you expect, sir? It's the custom. They all do it, and it's of no use trying to stop them.'\\n\\\"'But at least hurry up!' I cried.\\n\\\"He answered: 'But I can't go any faster.'\\n\\\"He entered the vestry, while we remained outside on the church steps. I was suffering. But what about the poor little creature who was howling from the effects of the biting cold.\\n\\\"At last the door opened. He went into the church. But the poor child had to remain naked throughout the ceremony. It was interminable. The priest stammered over the Latin words and mispronounced them horribly. He walked slowly and with a ponderous tread. His white surplice chilled my heart. It seemed as though, in the name of a pitiless and barbarous god, he had wrapped himself in another kind of snow in order to torture this little piece of humanity that suffered so from the cold.\\n\\\"Finally the christening was finished according to the rites and I saw the nurse once more take the frozen, moaning child and wrap it up in the blanket.\\n\\\"The priest said to me: 'Do you wish to sign the register?'\\n\\\"Turning to my gardener, I said: \\\"Hurry up and get home quickly so that you can warm that child.' I gave him some advice so as to ward off, if not too late, a bad attack of pneumonia. He promised to follow my instructions and left with his sister-in-law and the nurse. I followed the priest into the vestry, and when I had signed he demanded five francs for expenses.\\n\\\"As I had already given the father ten francs, I refused to pay twice. The priest threatened to destroy the paper and to annul the ceremony. I, in turn, threatened him with the district attorney. The dispute was long, and I finally paid five francs.\\n\\\"As soon as I reached home I went down to Kerandec's to find out whether everything was all right. Neither father, nor sister-in-law, nor nurse had yet returned. The mother, who had remained alone, was in bed, shivering with cold and starving, for she had had nothing to eat since the day before.\\n\\\"'Where the deuce can they have gone?' I asked. She answered without surprise or anger, 'They're going to drink something to celebrate: It was the custom. Then I thought, of my ten francs which were to pay the church and would doubtless pay for the alcohol.\\n\\\"I sent some broth to the mother and ordered a good fire to be built in the room. I was uneasy and furious and promised myself to drive out these brutes, wondering with terror what was going to happen to the poor infant.\\n\\\"It was already six, and they had not yet returned. I told my servant to wait for them and I went to bed. I soon fell asleep and slept like a top. At daybreak I was awakened by my servant, who was bringing me my hot water.\\n\\\"As soon as my eyes were open I asked: 'How about Kerandec?'\\n\\\"The man hesitated and then stammered: 'Oh! he came back, all right, after midnight, and so drunk that he couldn't walk, and so were Kermagan and the nurse. I guess they must have slept in a ditch, for the little one died and they never even noticed it.'\\n\\\"I jumped up out of bed, crying:\\n\\\"'What! The child is dead?'\\n\\\"'Yes, sir. They brought it back to Mother Kerandec. When she saw it she began to cry, and now they are making her drink to console her.'\\n\\\"'What's that? They are making her drink!'\\n\\\"'Yes, sir. I only found it out this morning. As Kerandec had no more brandy or money, he took some wood alcohol, which monsieur gave him for the lamp, and all four of them are now drinking that. The mother is feeling pretty sick now.'\\n\\\"I had hastily put on some clothes, and seizing a stick, with the intention of applying it to the backs of these human beasts, I hastened towards the gardener's house.\\n\\\"The mother was raving drunk beside the blue body of her dead baby. Kerandec, the nurse, and the Kermagan woman were snoring on the floor. I had to take care of the mother, who died towards noon.\\\"\\nThe old doctor was silent. He took up the brandy-bottle and poured out another glass. He held it up to the lamp, and the light streaming through it imparted to the liquid the amber color of molten topaz. With one gulp he swallowed the treacherous drink.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story revolves around an old ship's surgeon who tells a doctor about a tragic event he witnessed in Brittany.

They have a saying that when the bottle is full, they can see the reef, but when it is empty, they no longer see the dangers.\\n\\nThe surgeon then tells the doctor about the event that unfolded near his vacation home. The gardener's wife gave birth to a baby boy, and the gardener asked the surgeon to be the godfather. They planned to have the christening on the second day of January. However, on that day, the church door was closed, and they had to wait for the priest to arrive.\\n\\nWhile waiting, the surgeon noticed that the nurse undressed the baby, leaving it completely naked in the freezing cold. Infuriated, the surgeon protested, but the nurse explained that it was a custom to present the child naked before the Lord. The surgeon pleaded and scolded, but the nurse remained firm in her belief that failure to adhere to the custom would bring misfortune.\\n\\nWhen the priest eventually arrived, he walked slowly and performed the christening ceremony while the baby shivered from the cold.

The peasants doubtless attached to this word, \\\"Manor,\\\" a meaning of wealth and of splendor, for this farm was undoubtedly the largest, richest and the best managed in the whole neighborhood.\\nThe immense court, surrounded by five rows of magnificent trees, which sheltered the delicate apple trees from the harsh wind of the plain, inclosed in its confines long brick buildings used for storing fodder and grain, beautiful stables built of hard stone and made to accommodate thirty horses, and a red brick residence which looked like a little chateau.\\nThanks for the good care taken, the manure heaps were as little offensive as such things can be; the watch-dogs lived in kennels, and countless poultry paraded through the tall grass.\\nEvery day, at noon, fifteen persons, masters, farmhands and the women folks, seated themselves around the long kitchen table where the soup was brought in steaming in a large, blue-flowered bowl.\\nThe beasts-horses, cows, pigs and sheep-were fat, well fed and clean. Maitre Lucas, a tall man who was getting stout, would go round three times a day, overseeing everything and thinking of everything.\\nA very old white horse, which the mistress wished to keep until its natural death, because she had brought it up and had always used it, and also because it recalled many happy memories, was housed, through sheer kindness of heart, at the end of the stable.\\nA young scamp about fifteen years old, Isidore Duval by name, and called, for convenience, Zidore, took care of this pensioner, gave him his measure of oats and fodder in winter, and in summer was supposed to change his pasturing place four times a day, so that he might have plenty of fresh grass.\\nThe animal, almost crippled, lifted with difficulty his legs, large at the knees and swollen above the hoofs. His coat, which was no longer curried, looked like white hair, and his long eyelashes gave to his eyes a sad expression.\\nWhen Zidore took the animal to pasture, he had to pull on the rope with all his might, because it walked so slowly; and the youth, bent over and out of breath, would swear at it, exasperated at having to care for this old nag.\\nThe farmhands, noticing the young rascal's anger against Coco, were amused and would continually talk of the horse to Zidore, in order to exasperate him. His comrades would make sport with him. In the village he was called Coco-Zidore.\\nThe boy would fume, feeling an unholy desire to revenge himself on the horse. He was a thin, long-legged, dirty child, with thick, coarse, bristly red hair. He seemed only half-witted, and stuttered as though ideas were unable to form in his thick, brute-like mind.\\nFor a long time he had been unable to understand why Coco should be kept, indignant at seeing things wasted on this useless beast. Since the horse could no longer work, it seemed to him unjust that he should be fed; he revolted at the idea of wasting oats, oats which were so expensive, on this paralyzed old plug. And often, in spite of the orders of Maitre Lucas, he would economize on the nag's food, only giving him half measure. Hatred grew in his confused, childlike mind, the hatred of a stingy, mean, fierce, brutal and cowardly peasant.\\nWhen summer came he had to move the animal about in the pasture. It was some distance away. The rascal, angrier every morning, would start, with his dragging step, across the wheat fields. The men working in the fields would shout to him, jokingly:\\n\\\"Hey, Zidore, remember me to Coco.\\\"\\nHe would not answer; but on the way he would break off a switch, and, as soon as he had moved the old horse, he would let it begin grazing; then, treacherously sneaking up behind it, he would slash its legs. The animal would try to escape, to kick, to get away from the blows, and run around in a circle about its rope, as though it had been inclosed in a circus ring. And the boy would slash away furiously, running along behind, his teeth clenched in anger.\\nThen he would go away slowly, without turning round, while the horse watched him disappear, his ribs sticking out, panting as a result of his unusual exertions. Not until the blue blouse of the young peasant was out of sight would he lower his thin white head to the grass.\\nAs the nights were now warm, Coco was allowed to sleep out of doors, in the field behind the little wood. Zidore alone went to see him. The boy threw stones at him to amuse himself. He would sit down on an embankment about ten feet away and would stay there about half an hour, from time to time throwing a sharp stone at the old horse, which remained standing tied before his enemy, watching him continually and not daring to eat before he was gone.\\nThis one thought persisted in the mind of the young scamp: \\\"Why feed this horse, which is no longer good for anything?\\\" It seemed to him that this old nag was stealing the food of the others, the goods of man and God, that he was even robbing him, Zidore, who was working.\\nThen, little by little, each day, the boy began to shorten the length of rope which allowed the horse to graze.\\nThe hungry animal was growing thinner, and starving. Too feeble to break his bonds, he would stretch his head out toward the tall, green, tempting grass, so near that he could smell, and yet so far that he could not touch it.\\nBut one morning Zidore had an idea: it was, not to move Coco any more. He was tired of walking so far for that old skeleton. He came, however, in order to enjoy his vengeance. The beast watched him anxiously. He did not beat him that day. He walked around him with his hands in his pockets. He even pretended to change his place, but he sank the stake in exactly the same hole, and went away overjoyed with his invention.\\nThe horse, seeing him leave, neighed to call him back; but the rascal began to run, leaving him alone, entirely alone in his field, well tied down and without a blade of grass within reach.\\nStarving, he tried to reach the grass which he could touch with the end of his nose. He got on his knees, stretching out his neck and his long, drooling lips. All in vain. The old animal spent the whole day in useless, terrible efforts. The sight of all that green food, which stretched out on all sides of him, served to increase the gnawing pangs of hunger.\\nThe scamp did not return that day. He wandered through the woods in search of nests.\\nThe next day he appeared upon the scene again. Coco, exhausted, had lain down. When he saw the boy, he got up, expecting at last to have his place changed.\\nBut the little peasant did not even touch the mallet, which was lying on the ground. He came nearer, looked at the animal, threw at his head a clump of earth which flattened out against the white hair, and he started off again, whistling.\\nThe horse remained standing as long as he could see him; then, knowing that his attempts to reach the near-by grass would be hopeless, he once more lay down on his side and closed his eyes.\\nThe following day Zidore did not come.\\nWhen he did come at last, he found Coco still stretched out; he saw that he was dead.\\nThen he remained standing, looking at him, pleased with what he had done, surprised that it should already be all over. He touched him with his foot, lifted one of his legs and then let it drop, sat on him and remained there, his eyes fixed on the grass, thinking of nothing. He returned to the farm, but did not mention the accident, because he wished to wander about at the hours when he used to change the horse's pasture. He went to see him the next day. At his approach some crows flew away. Countless flies were walking over the body and were buzzing around it. When he returned home, he announced the event. The animal was so old that nobody was surprised.

In an act of revenge, he starts shortening Coco's rope, denying the starving horse access to any grass. Zidore revels in witnessing the horse's futile attempts to reach the tantalizing blades of grass just out of his range.\\n\\nOne day, Zidore comes up with an idea. Instead of moving Coco to graze, he leaves him in the same spot but plays pretend by pretending to change his place. This causes Coco to remain stranded, tied down without access to any grass. Starving, Coco desperately tries, and fails, to reach the grass within his sight.\\n\\nZidore continues to torment Coco, occasionally hurling clumps of dirt at the horse and refusing to change his grazing spot. Coco slowly grows weaker with each passing day until he dies from hunger. Sheathed unnoticed by his resented owner, the horse's body is surrounded by crows and flies feed on him.\\n\\nWhen Zidore realizes that Coco has died, he smirks in satisfaction, observing the body with detached amusement. He does not inform anyone of Coco's death so he can sneak off during his regular grazing hours. Eventually, he casually mentions Coco's demise to others. The farm workers bury Coco right where he died, and the grass flourishes notably better in that spot, nourished by the horse's body.\\n\\nThe end result is a story highlighting the cruelty and neglect imposed upon an innocent animal due to Zidore's malicious nature, ending with a darkly ironic consequence of how the lost life ultimately nurtures new life around its final resting place.\", \"story_token_count\": 2032, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 489, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 595}, {\"Title\": \"The Coming-Out of Maggie\", \"Author\": \"O. Henry\", \"story\": \"Every Saturday night the Clover Leaf Social Club gave a hop in the hall of the Give and Take Athletic Association on the East Side. In order to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the Give and Take--or, if you belong to the division that starts off with the right foot in waltzing, you must work in Rhinegold's paper-box factory. Still, any Clover Leaf was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance. But mostly each Give and Take brought the paper-box girl that he affected; and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops.\\nMaggie Toole, on account of her dull eyes, broad mouth and left- handed style of footwork in the twostep, went to the dances with Anna McCarty and her \\\"fellow.\\\" Anna and Maggie worked side by side in the factory, and were the greatest chums ever. So Anna always made Jimmy Burns take her by Maggie's house every Saturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them.\\nThe Give and Take Athletic Association lived up to its name. The hall of the association in Orchard street was fitted out with muscle-making inventions. With the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous combat. Between these more serious occupations the Saturday night hop with the paper-box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen. For sometimes the tip went 'round, and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter-weight affair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes.\\nOn Saturdays Rhinegold's paper-box factory closed at 3 P. M. On one such afternoon Anna and Maggie walked homeward together. At Maggie's door Anna said, as usual: \\\"Be ready at seven, sharp, Mag; and Jimmy and we'll come by for you.\\\"\\nBut what was this? Instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the non-escorted one there was to be perceived a high- poised head, a prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth, and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye.\\n\\\"Thanks, Anna,\\\" said Maggie; \\\"but you and Jimmy needn't bother to-night. I've a gentleman friend that's coming 'round to escort me to the hop.\\\"\\nThe comely Anna pounced upon her friend, shook her, chided and beseeched her. Maggie Toole catch a fellow! Plain, dear, loyal, unattractive Maggie, so sweet as a chum, so unsought for a two-step or a moonlit bench in the little park. How was it? When did it happen? Who was it?\\n\\\"You'll see to-night,\\\" said Maggie, flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had gathered in Cupid's vineyard. \\\"He's swell all right. He's two inches taller than Jimmy, and an up-to-date dresser. I'll introduce him, Anna, just as soon as we get to the hall.\\\"\\nAnna and Jimmy were among the first Clover Leafs to arrive that evening. Anna's eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friend's \\\"catch.\\\"\\nAt 8:30 Miss Toole swept into the hall with her escort. Quickly her triumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful Jimmy.\\n\\\"Oh, gee!\\\" cried Anna, \\\"Mag ain't made a hit--oh, no! Swell fellow? well, I guess! Style? Look at 'um.\\\"\\n\\\"Go as far as you like,\\\" said Jimmy, with sandpaper in his voice. \\\"Cop him out if you want him. These new guys always win out with the push. Don't mind me. He don't squeeze all the limes, I guess. Huh!\\\"\\n\\\"Shut up, Jimmy. You know what I mean. I'm glad for Mag. First fellow she ever had. Oh, here they come.\\\"\\nAcross the floor Maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser. And truly, her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum. He stood two inches taller than the average Give and Take athlete; his dark hair curled; his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles. The young men of the Clover Leaf Club pinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess, its achievements in hand-to-hand conflicts, and its preservation from the legal duress that constantly menaced it. The member of the association who would bind a paperbox maiden to his conquering chariot scorned to employ Beau Brummel airs. They were not considered honourable methods of warfare. The swelling biceps, the coat straining at its buttons over the chest, the air of conscious conviction of the supereminence of the male in the cosmogony of creation, even a calm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents in the gentle tourneys of Cupid--these were the approved arms and ammunition of the Clover Leaf gallants. They viewed, then, genuflexions and alluring poses of this visitor with their chins at a new angle.\\n\\\"A friend of mine, Mr. Terry O'Sullivan,\\\" was Maggie's formula of introduction. She led him around the room, presenting him to each new-arriving Clover Leaf. Almost was she pretty now, with the unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor and a kitten with its first mouse.\\n\\\"Maggie Toole's got a fellow at last,\\\" was the word that went round among the paper-box girls. \\\"Pipe Mag's floor-walker\\\"--thus the Give and Takes expressed their indifferent contempt.\\nUsually at the weekly hops Maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back. She felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a self- sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished. She had even grown used to noticing Anna joggle the reluctant Jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two-step.\\nBut to-night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six. Terry O'Sullivan was a victorious Prince Charming, and Maggie Toole winged her first butterfly flight. And though our tropes of fairyland be mixed with those of entomology they shall not spill one drop of ambrosia from the rose-crowned melody of Maggie's one perfect night.\\nThe girls besieged her for introductions to her \\\"fellow.\\\" The Clover Leaf young men, after two years of blindness, suddenly perceived charms in Miss Toole. They flexed their compelling muscles before her and bespoke her for the dance.\\nThus she scored; but to Terry O'Sullivan the honours of the evening fell thick and fast. He shook his curls; he smiled and went easily through the seven motions for acquiring grace in your own room before an open window ten minutes each day. He danced like a faun; he introduced manner and style and atmosphere; his words came trippingly upon his tongue, and--he waltzed twice in succession with the paper- box girl that Dempsey Donovan brought.\\nDempsey was the leader of the association. He wore a dress suit, and could chin the bar twice with one hand. He was one of \\\"Big Mike\\\" O'Sullivan's lieutenants, and was never troubled by trouble. No cop dared to arrest him. Whenever be broke a pushcart man's head or shot a member of the Heinrick B. Sweeney Outing and Literary Association in the kneecap, an officer would drop around and say:\\n\\\"The Cap'n 'd like to see ye a few minutes round to the office whin ye have time, Dempsey, me boy.\\\"\\nBut there would be sundry gentlemen there with large gold fob chains and black cigars; and somebody would tell a funny story, and then Dempsey would go back and work half an hour with the sixpound dumbbells. So, doing a tight-rope act on a wire stretched across Niagara was a safe terpsichorean performance compared with waltzing twice with Dempsey Donovan's paper-box girl. At 10 o'clock the jolly round face of \\\"Big Mike\\\" O'Sullivan shone at the door for five minutes upon the scene. He always looked in for five minutes, smiled at the girls and handed out real perfectos to the delighted boys.\\nDempsey Donovan was at his elbow instantly, talking rapidly. \\\"Big Mike\\\" looked carefully at the dancers, smiled, shook his head and departed.\\nThe music stopped. The dancers scattered to the chairs along the walls. Terry O'Sullivan, with his entrancing bow, relinquished a pretty girl in blue to her partner and started back to find Maggie. Dempsey intercepted him in the middle of the floor.\\nSome fine instinct that Rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly every one to turn and look at them--there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena. Two or three Give and Takes with tight coat sleeves drew nearer.\\n\\\"One moment, Mr. O'Sullivan,\\\" said Dempsey. \\\"I hope you're enjoying yourself. Where did you say you live?\\\"\\nThe two gladiators were well matched. Dempsey had, perhaps, ten pounds of weight to give away. The O'Sullivan had breadth with quickness. Dempsey had a glacial eye, a dominating slit of a mouth, an indestructible jaw, a complexion like a belle's and the coolness of a champion. The visitor showed more fire in his contempt and less control over his conspicuous sneer. They were enemies by the law written when the rocks were molten. They were each too splendid, too mighty, too incomparable to divide pre-eminence. One only must survive.\\n\\\"I live on Grand,\\\" said O'Sullivan, insolently; \\\"and no trouble to find me at home. Where do you live?\\\"\\nDempsey ignored the question.\\n\\\"You say your name's O'Sullivan,\\\" he went on. \\\"Well, 'Big Mike' says he never saw you before.\\\"\\n\\\"Lots of things he never saw,\\\" said the favourite of the hop.\\n\\\"As a rule,\\\" went on Dempsey, huskily sweet, \\\"O'Sullivans in this district know one another. You escorted one of our lady members here, and we want chance to make good. If you've got a family tree let's see a few historical O'Sullivan buds come out on it. Or do you want us to dig it out of you by the roots?\\\"\\n\\\"Suppose you mind your own business,\\\" suggested O'Sullivan, blandly.\\nDempsey's eye brightened. He held up an inspired forefinger as though a brilliant idea had struck him.\\n\\\"I've got it now,\\\" he said cordially. \\\"It was just a little mistake. You ain't no O'Sullivan. You are a ring-tailed monkey. Excuse us for not recognising you at first.\\\"\\nO'Sullivan's eye flashed. He made a quick movement, but Andy Geoghan was ready and caught his arm.\\nDempsey nodded at Andy and William McMahan, the secretary of the club, and walked rapidly toward a door at the rear of the hall. Two other members of the Give and Take Association swiftly joined the little group. Terry O'Sullivan was now in the hands of the Board of Rules and Social Referees. They spoke to him briefly and softly, and conducted him out through the same door at the rear.\\nThis movement on the part of the Clover Leaf members requires a word of elucidation. Back of the association hall was a smaller room rented by the club. In this room personal difficulties that arose on the ballroom floor were settled, man to man, with the weapons of nature, under the supervision of the board. No lady could say that she had witnessed a fight at a Clover Leaf hop in several years. Its gentlemen members guaranteed that.\\nSo easily and smoothly had Dempsey and the board done their preliminary work that many in the hall had not noticed the checking of the fascinating O'Sullivan's social triumph. Among these was Maggie. She looked about for her escort.\\n\\\"Smoke up!\\\" said Rose Cassidy. \\\"Wasn't you on? Demps Donovan picked a scrap with your Lizzie-boy, and they've waltzed out to the slaughter room with him. How's my hair look done up this way, Mag?\\\"\\nMaggie laid a hand on the bosom of her cheesecloth waist.\\n\\\"Gone to fight with Dempsey!\\\" she said, breathlessly. \\\"They've got to be stopped. Dempsey Donovan can't fight him. Why, he'll--he'll kill him!\\\"\\n\\\"Ah, what do you care?\\\" said Rosa. \\\"Don't some of 'em fight every hop?\\\"\\nBut Maggie was off, darting her zig-zag way through the maze of dancers. She burst through the rear door into the dark hall and then threw her solid shoulder against the door of the room of single combat. It gave way, and in the instant that she entered her eye caught the scene--the Board standing about with open watches; Dempsey Donovan in his shirt sleeves dancing, light-footed, with the wary grace of the modern pugilist, within easy reach of his adversary; Terry O'Sullivan standing with arms folded and a murderous look in his dark eyes. And without slacking the speed of her entrance she leaped forward with a scream--leaped in time to catch and hang upon the arm of O'Sullivan that was suddenly uplifted, and to whisk from it the long, bright stiletto that he had drawn from his bosom.\\nThe knife fell and rang upon the floor. Cold steel drawn in the rooms of the Give and Take Association! Such a thing had never happened before. Every one stood motionless for a minute. Andy Geoghan kicked the stiletto with the toe of his shoe curiously, like an antiquarian who has come upon some ancient weapon unknown to his learning.\\nAnd then O'Sullivan hissed something unintelligible between his teeth. Dempsey and the board exchanged looks. And then Dempsey looked at O'Sullivan without anger, as one looks at a stray dog, and nodded his head in the direction of the door.\\n\\\"The back stairs, Giuseppi,\\\" he said, briefly. \\\"Somebody'll pitch your hat down after you.\\\"\\nMaggie walked up to Dempsey Donovan. There was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks, down which slow tears were running. But she looked him bravely in the eye.\\n\\\"I knew it, Dempsey,\\\" she said, as her eyes grew dull even in their tears. \\\"I knew he was a Guinea. His name's Tony Spinelli. I hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin'. Them Guineas always carries knives. But you don't understand, Dempsey. I never had a fellow in my life. I got tired of comin' with Anna and Jimmy every night, so I fixed it with him to call himself O'Sullivan, and brought him along. I knew there'd be nothin' doin' for him if he came as a Dago. I guess I'll resign from the club now.\\\"\\nDempsey turned to Andy Geoghan.\\n\\\"Chuck that cheese slicer out of the window,\\\" he said, \\\"and tell 'em inside that Mr. O'Sullivan has had a telephone message to go down to Tammany Hall.\\\"\\nAnd then he turned back to Maggie.\\n\\\"Say, Mag,\\\" he said, \\\"I'll see you home. And how about next Saturday night? Will you come to the hop with me if I call around for you?\\\"\\nIt was remarkable how quickly Maggie's eyes could change from dull to a shining brown.\\n\\\"With you, Dempsey?\\\" she stammered. \\\"Say--will a duck swim?\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In this story, the Clover Leaf Social Club holds a dance every Saturday night.

They stretched in undulating folds between the clumps of trees that marked each farmhouse; the different crops, ripe rye and yellowing wheat, pale-green oats, dark-green clover, spread a vast striped cloak, soft and rippling, over the naked body of the earth.\\nIn the distance, on the crest of a slope, was an endless line of cows, ranked like soldiers, some lying down, others standing, their large eyes blinking in the burning light, chewing the cud and grazing on a field of clover as broad as a lake.\\nTwo women, mother and daughter, were walking with a swinging step, one behind the other, towards this regiment of cattle. Each carried two zinc pails, slung outwards from the body on a hoop from a cask; at each step the metal sent out a dazzling white flash under the sun that struck full upon it.\\nThe women did not speak. They were on their way to milk the cows. When they arrive, they set down one of their pails and approach the first two cows, making them stand up with a kick in the ribs from wooden-shod feet. The beast rises slowly, first on its forelegs, then with more difficulty raises its large hind quarters, which seem to be weighted down by the enormous udder of livid pendulous flesh.\\nThe two Malivoires, mother and daughter, kneeling beneath the animal's belly, tug with a swift movement of their hands at the swollen teat, which at each squeeze sends a slender jet of milk into the pail. The yellowish froth mounts to the brim, and the women go from cow to cow until they reach the end of the long line.\\nAs soon as they finish milking a beast, they change its position, giving it a fresh patch of grass on which to graze.\\nThen they start on their way home, more slowly now, weighed down by the load of milk, the mother in front, the daughter behind.\\nAbruptly the latter halts, sets down her burden, Sits down, and begins to cry.\\nMadame Malivoire, missing the sound of steps behind her, turns round and is quite amazed.\\n\\\"What's the matter with you?\\\" she said.\\nHer daughter Celeste, a tall girl with flaming red hair and flaming cheeks, flecked with freckles as though sparks of fire had fallen upon her face one day as she worked in the sun, murmurs, moaning softly, like a beaten child:\\n\\\"I can't carry the milk any further.\\\"\\nHer mother looked at her suspiciously.\\n\\\"What's the matter with you?\\\" she repeated.\\n\\\"It drags too heavy, I can't,\\\" replied Celeste, who had collapsed and was lying on the ground between the two pails, hiding her eyes in her apron.\\n\\\"What's the matter with you, then?\\\" said her mother for the third time. The girl moaned:\\n\\\"I think there's a baby on the way.\\\" And she broke into sobs.\\nThe old woman now in her turn set down her load, so amazed that she could find nothing to say. At last she stammered:\\n\\\"You . . . you . . . you're going to have a baby, you clod! How can that be?\\\"\\nThe Malivoires were prosperous farmers, wealthy and of a certain position, widely respected, good business folk, of some importance in the district.\\n\\\"I think I am, all the same,\\\" faltered Celeste.\\nThe frightened mother looked at the weeping girl grovelling at her feet. After a few seconds she cried:\\n\\\"You're going to have a baby! A baby! Where did you get it, you slut?\\\"\\nCeleste, shaken with emotion, murmured:\\n\\\"I think it was in Polyte's coach.\\\"\\nThe old woman tried to understand, tried to imagine, to realise who could have brought this misfortune upon her daughter. If the lad was well off and of decent position, an arrangement might be come to. The damage could still be repaired. Celeste was not the first to be in the same way, but it was annoying all the same, seeing their position and the way people talked.\\n\\\"And who was it, you slut?\\\" she repeated.\\nCeleste, resolved to make a clean breast of it, stammered:\\n\\\"I think it was Polyte.\\\"\\nAt that Madame Malivoire, mad with rage, rushed upon her daughter and began to beat her with such fury that her hat fell off in the effort.\\nWith great blows of the fist she struck her on the head, on the back, all over her body; Celeste, prostrate between the two pails, which afforded her some slight protection, shielded just her face with her hands.\\nAll the cows, disturbed, had stopped grazing and turned round, staring with their great eyes. The last one mooed, stretching out its muzzle towards the women.\\nAfter beating her daughter till she was out of breath, Madame Malivoire stopped, exhausted; her spirits reviving a little, she tried to get a thorough understanding of the situation.\\n\\\"--- Polyte! Lord save us, it's not possible! How could you, with a carrier? You must have lost your wits. He must have played you a trick, the good-for-nothing!\\\"\\nCeleste, still prostrate, murmured in the dust:\\n\\\"I didn't pay my fare!\\\"\\nAnd the old Norman woman understood.\\nEvery week, on Wednesday and on Saturday, Celeste went to town with the farm produce, poultry, cream, and eggs.\\nShe started at seven with her two huge baskets on her arm, the dairy produce in one, the chickens in the other, and went to the main road to wait for the coach to Yvetot.\\nShe set down her wares and sat in the ditch, while the chickens with their short pointed beaks and the ducks with their broad flat bills thrust their heads between the wicker bars and looked about them with their round, stupid, surprised eyes.\\nSoon the bus, a sort of yellow box with a black leather cap on the top, came up, jerking and quivering with the trotting of the old white horse.\\nPolyte the coachman, a big, jolly fellow, stout though still young, and so burnt up by sun and wind, soaked by rain, and coloured with brandy that his face and neck were brick-red, cracked his whip and shouted from the distance:\\n\\\"Morning, Mam'selle Celeste. In good health, I hope?\\\"\\nShe gave him her baskets, one after the other, which he stowed in the boot; then she got in, lifting her leg high up to reach the step, and exposing a sturdy leg clad in a blue stocking.\\nEvery time Polyte repeated the same joke: \\\"Well, it's not got any thinner.\\\"\\nShe laughed, thinking this funny.\\nThen he uttered a \\\"Gee up, old girl!\\\" which started off the thin horse. Then Celeste, reaching for her purse in the depths of her pocket, slowly took out fivepence, threepence for herself and twopence for the baskets, and handed them to Polyte over his shoulder.\\nHe took them, saying:\\n\\\"Aren't we going to have our little bit of sport to-day?\\\"\\nAnd he laughed heartily, turning round towards her so as to stare at her at his ease.\\nShe found it a big expense, the half-franc for a journey of two miles. And when she had no coppers she felt it still more keenly; it was hard to make up her mind to part with a silver coin.\\nOne day, as she was paying, she asked:\\n\\\"From a good customer like me you oughtn't to take more than threepence.\\\"\\nHe burst out laughing.\\n\\\"Threepence, my beauty; why, you're worth more than that.\\\"\\nShe insisted on the point.\\n\\\"But you make a good two francs a month out of me.\\\"\\nHe whipped up his horse and exclaimed:\\n\\\"Look here, I'm an obliging fellow! We'll call it quits for a bit of sport.\\\"\\n\\\"What do you mean?\\\" she asked with an air of innocence.\\nHe was so amused that he laughed till he coughed.\\n\\\"A bit of sport is a bit of sport, damn it; a game for a lad and a lass, a dance for two without music.\\\"\\nShe understood, blushed, and declared:\\n\\\"I don't care for that sort of game, Monsieur Polyte.\\\"\\nBut he was in no way abashed, and repeated, with growing merriment:\\n\\\"You'll come to it some day, my beauty, a bit of sport for a lad and a lass!\\\"\\nAnd since that day he had taken to asking her, each time that she paid her fare:\\n\\\"Aren't we going to have our bit of sport to-day?\\\"\\nShe, too, joked about it by this time, and replied:\\n\\\"Not to-day, Monsieur Polyte, but Saturday, for certain!\\\"\\nAnd amid peals of laughter he answered:\\n\\\"Saturday, then, my beauty.\\\"\\nBut inwardly she calculated that, during the two years the affair had been going on, she had paid Polyte forty-eight whole francs, and in the country forty-eight francs is not a sum which can be picked up on the roadside; she also calculated that in two more years she would have paid nearly a hundred francs.\\nTo such purpose she meditated that, one spring day as they jogged on alone, when he made his customary inquiry: \\\"Aren't we going to have our bit of sport yet?\\\" She replied:\\n\\\"Yes, if you like, Monsieur Polyte.\\\"\\nHe was not at all surprised, and clambered over the back of his seat, murmuring with a complacent air:\\n\\\"Come along, then. I knew you'd come to it some day.\\\"\\nThe old white horse trotted so gently that she seemed to be dancing upon the same spot, deaf to the voice which cried at intervals, from the depths of the vehicle: \\\"Gee up, old girl! Gee up, then!\\\"\\nThree months later Celeste discovered that she was going to have a child.\\nAll this she had told her mother in a tearful voice. Pale with fury, the old woman asked:\\n\\\"Well, what did it cost?\\\"\\n\\\"Four months; that makes eight francs, doesn't it?\\\" replied Celeste.\\nAt that the peasant woman's fury was utterly unleashed, and, falling once more upon her daughter, she beat her a second time until she was out of breath. Then she rose and said:\\n\\\"Have you told him about the baby?\\\"\\n\\\"No, of course not.\\\"\\n\\\"Why haven't you told him?\\\"\\n\\\"Because very likely he'd have made me pay for all the free rides!\\\"\\nThe old woman pondered awhile, then picked up her milkpails.\\n\\\"Come on, get up, and try to walk home,\\\" she said, and, after a pause, continued:\\n\\\"And don't tell him as long as he doesn't notice anything, and we'll make six or eight months' fares out of him.\\\"\\nAnd Celeste, who had risen, still crying, dishevelled and swollen round the eyes, started off again with dragging steps, murmuring:\\n\\\"Of course I won't say.\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In this story, set in rural France, a mother and daughter are working on a farm, milking cows to collect milk.

On the sideboard behind her, two tall glasses, soda water, whiskey. Fresh ice cubes in the Thermos bucket.\\nMary Maloney was waiting for her husband to come home from work.\\nNow and again she would glance up at the clock, but without anxiety, merely to please herself with the thought that each minute gone by made it nearer the time when he would come. There was a slow smiling air about her, and about everything she did. The drop of a head as she bent over her sewing was curiously tranquil. Her skin--for this was her sixth month with child--had acquired a wonderful translucent quality, the mouth was soft, and the eyes, with their new placid look, seemed larger darker than before. When the clock said ten minutes to five, she began to listen, and a few moments later, punctually as always, she heard the tires on the gravel outside, and the car door slamming, the footsteps passing the window, the key turning in the lock. She laid aside her sewing, stood up, and went forward to kiss him as he came in.\\n\\\"Hullo darling,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"Hullo darling,\\\" he answered.\\nShe took his coat and hung it in the closet. Then she walked over and made the drinks, a strongish one for him, a weak one for herself; and soon she was back again in her chair with the sewing, and he in the other, opposite, holding the tall glass with both hands, rocking it so the ice cubes tinkled against the side.\\nFor her, this was always a blissful time of day. She knew he didn't want to speak much until the first drink was finished, and she, on her side, was content to sit quietly, enjoying his company after the long hours alone in the house. She loved to luxuriate in the presence of this man, and to feel-almost as a sunbather feels the sun-that warm male glow that came out of him to her when they were alone together. She loved him for the way he sat loosely in a chair, for the way he came in a door, or moved slowly across the room with long strides. She loved intent, far look in his eyes when they rested in her, the funny shape of the mouth, and especially the way he remained silent about his tiredness, sitting still with himself until the whiskey had taken some of it away.\\n\\\"Tired darling?\\\"\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm tired,\\\" And as he spoke, he did an unusual thing. He lifted his glass and drained it in one swallow although there was still half of it, at least half of it left.. She wasn't really watching him, but she knew what he had done because she heard the ice cubes falling back against the bottom of the empty glass when he lowered his arm. He paused a moment, leaning forward in the chair, then he got up and went slowly over to fetch himself another.\\n\\\"I'll get it!\\\" she cried, jumping up.\\n\\\"Sit down,\\\" he said.\\nWhen he came back, she noticed that the new drink was dark amber with the quantity of whiskey in it.\\n\\\"Darling, shall I get your slippers?\\\"\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\nShe watched him as he began to sip the dark yellow drink, and she could see little oily swirls in the liquid because it was so strong.\\n\\\"I think it's a shame,\\\" she said, \\\"that when a policeman gets to be as senior as you, they keep him walking about on his feet all day long.\\\"\\nHe didn't answer, so she bent her head again and went on with her sewing; but each time he lifted the drink to his lips, she heard the ice cubes clinking against the side of the glass.\\n\\\"Darling,\\\" she said. \\\"Would you like me to get you some cheese? I haven't made any supper because it's Thursday.\\\"\\n\\\"No,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"If you're too tired to eat out,\\\" she went on, \\\"it's still not too late. There's plenty of meat and stuff in the freezer, and you can have it right here and not even move out of the chair.\\\"\\nHer eyes waited on him for an answer, a smile, a little nod, but he made no sign.\\n\\\"Anyway,\\\" she went on, \\\"I'll get you some cheese and crackers first.\\\"\\n\\\"I don't want it,\\\" he said.\\nShe moved uneasily in her chair, the large eyes still watching his face. \\\"But you must eat! I'll fix it anyway, and then you can have it or not, as you like.\\\"\\nShe stood up and placed her sewing on the table by the lamp.\\n\\\"Sit down,\\\" he said. \\\"Just for a minute, sit down.\\\"\\nIt wasn't till then that she began to get frightened.\\n\\\"Go on,\\\" he said. \\\"Sit down.\\\"\\nShe lowered herself back slowly into the chair, watching him all the time with those large, bewildered eyes. He had finished the second drink and was staring down into the glass, frowning.\\n\\\"Listen,\\\" he said. \\\"I've got something to tell you.\\\"\\n\\\"What is it, darling? What's the matter?\\\"\\nHe had now become absolutely motionless, and he kept his head down so that the light from the lamp beside him fell across the upper part of his face, leaving the chin and mouth in shadow. She noticed there was a little muscle moving near the corner of his left eye.\\n\\\"This is going to be a bit of a shock to you, I'm afraid,\\\" he said. \\\"But I've thought about it a good deal and I've decided the only thing to do is tell you right away. I hope you won't blame me too much.\\\"\\nAnd he told her. It didn't take long, four or five minutes at most, and she say very still through it all, watching him with a kind of dazed horror as he went further and further away from her with each word.\\n\\\"So there it is,\\\" he added. \\\"And I know it's kind of a bad time to be telling you, bet there simply wasn't any other way. Of course I'll give you money and see you're looked after. But there needn't really be any fuss. I hope not anyway. It wouldn't be very good for my job.\\\"\\nHer first instinct was not to believe any of it, to reject it all. It occurred to her that perhaps he hadn't even spoken, that she herself had imagined the whole thing. Maybe, if she went about her business and acted as though she hadn't been listening, then later, when she sort of woke up again, she might find none of it had ever happened.\\n\\\"I'll get the supper,\\\" she managed to whisper, and this time he didn't stop her.\\nWhen she walked across the room she couldn't feel her feet touching the floor. She couldn't feel anything at all- except a slight nausea and a desire to vomit. Everything was automatic now-down the steps to the cellar, the light switch, the deep freeze, the hand inside the cabinet taking hold of the first object it met. She lifted it out, and looked at it. It was wrapped in paper, so she took off the paper and looked at it again.\\nA leg of lamb.\\nAll right then, they would have lamb for supper. She carried it upstairs, holding the thin bone-end of it with both her hands, and as she went through the living-room, she saw him standing over by the window with his back to her, and she stopped.\\n\\\"For God's sake,\\\" he said, hearing her, but not turning round. \\\"Don't make supper for me. I'm going out.\\\"\\nAt that point, Mary Maloney simply walked up behind him and without any pause she swung the big frozen leg of lamb high in the air and brought it down as hard as she could on the back of his head.\\nShe might just as well have hit him with a steel club.\\nShe stepped back a pace, waiting, and the funny thing was that he remained standing there for at least four or five seconds, gently swaying. Then he crashed to the carpet.\\nThe violence of the crash, the noise, the small table overturning, helped bring her out of he shock. She came out slowly, feeling cold and surprised, and she stood for a while blinking at the body, still holding the ridiculous piece of meat tight with both hands.\\nAll right, she told herself. So I've killed him.\\nIt was extraordinary, now, how clear her mind became all of a sudden. She began thinking very fast. As the wife of a detective, she knew quite well what the penalty would be. That was fine. It made no difference to her. In fact, it would be a relief. On the other hand, what about the child? What were the laws about murderers with unborn children? Did they kill then both-mother and child? Or did they wait until the tenth month? What did they do?\\nMary Maloney didn't know. And she certainly wasn't prepared to take a chance.\\nShe carried the meat into the kitchen, placed it in a pan, turned the oven on high, and shoved t inside. Then she washed her hands and ran upstairs to the bedroom. She sat down before the mirror, tidied her hair, touched up her lops and face. She tried a smile. It came out rather peculiar. She tried again.\\n\\\"Hullo Sam,\\\" she said brightly, aloud.\\nThe voice sounded peculiar too.\\n\\\"I want some potatoes please, Sam. Yes, and I think a can of peas.\\\"\\nThat was better. Both the smile and the voice were coming out better now. She rehearsed it several times more. Then she ran downstairs, took her coat, went out the back door, down the garden, into the street.\\nIt wasn't six o'clock yet and the lights were still on in the grocery shop.\\n\\\"Hullo Sam,\\\" she said brightly, smiling at the man behind the counter.\\n\\\"Why, good evening, Mrs. Maloney. How're you?\\\"\\n\\\"I want some potatoes please, Sam. Yes, and I think a can of peas.\\\"\\nThe man turned and reached up behind him on the shelf for the peas.\\n\\\"Patrick's decided he's tired and doesn't want to eat out tonight,\\\" she told him. \\\"We usually go out Thursdays, you know, and now he's caught me without any vegetables in the house.\\\"\\n\\\"Then how about meat, Mrs. Maloney?\\\"\\n\\\"No, I've got meat, thanks. I got a nice leg of lamb from the freezer.\\\"\\n\\\"Oh.\\\"\\n\\\"I don't know much like cooking it frozen, Sam, but I'm taking a chance on it this time. You think it'll be all right?\\\"\\n\\\"Personally,\\\" the grocer said, \\\"I don't believe it makes any difference. You want these Idaho potatoes?\\\"\\n\\\"Oh yes, that'll be fine. Two of those.\\\"\\n\\\"Anything else?\\\" The grocer cocked his head on one side, looking at her pleasantly. \\\"How about afterwards? What you going to give him for afterwards?\\\"\\n\\\"Well-what would you suggest, Sam?\\\"\\nThe man glanced around his shop. \\\"How about a nice big slice of cheesecake? I know he likes that.\\\"\\n\\\"Perfect,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves it.\\\"\\nAnd when it was all wrapped and she had paid, she put on her brightest smile and said, \\\"Thank you, Sam. Goodnight.\\\"\\n\\\"Goodnight, Mrs. Maloney. And thank you.\\\"\\nAnd now, she told herself as she hurried back, all she was doing now, she was returning home to her husband and he was waiting for his supper; and she must cook it good, and make it as tasty as possible because the poor man was tired; and if, when she entered the house, she happened to find anything unusual, or tragic, or terrible, then naturally it would be a shock and she'd become frantic with grief and horror. Mind you, she wasn't expecting to find anything. She was just going home with the vegetables. Mrs. Patrick Maloney going home with the vegetables on Thursday evening to cook supper for her husband.\\nThat's the way, she told herself. Do everything right and natural. Keep things absolutely natural and there'll be no need for any acting at all.\\nTherefore, when she entered the kitchen by the back door, she was humming a little tune to herself and smiling.\\n\\\"Patrick!\\\" she called. \\\"How are you, darling?\\\"\\nShe put the parcel down on the table and went through into the living room; and when she saw him lying there on the floor with his legs doubled up and one arm twisted back underneath his body, it really was rather a shock. All the old love and longing for him welled up inside her, and she ran over to him, knelt down beside him, and began to cry her heart out. It was easy. No acting was necessary.\\nA few minutes later she got up and went to the phone. She know the number of the police station, and when the man at the other end answered, she cried to him, \\\"Quick! Come quick! Patrick's dead!\\\"\\n\\\"Who's speaking?\\\"\\n\\\"Mrs. Maloney. Mrs. Patrick Maloney.\\\"\\n\\\"You mean Patrick Maloney's dead?\\\"\\n\\\"I think so,\\\" she sobbed. \\\"He's lying on the floor and I think he's dead.\\\"\\n\\\"Be right over,\\\" the man said.\\nThe car came very quickly, and when she opened the front door, two policeman walked in. She know them both-she know nearly all the man at that precinct-and she fell right into a chair, then went over to join the other one, who was called O'Malley, kneeling by the body.\\n\\\"Is he dead?\\\" she cried.\\n\\\"I'm afraid he is. What happened?\\\"\\nBriefly, she told her story about going out to the grocer and coming back to find him on the floor. While she was talking, crying and talking, Noonan discovered a small patch of congealed blood on the dead man's head. He showed it to O'Malley who got up at once and hurried to the phone.\\nSoon, other men began to come into the house. First a doctor, then two detectives, one of whom she know by name. Later, a police photographer arrived and took pictures, and a man who know about fingerprints. There was a great deal of whispering and muttering beside the corpse, and the detectives kept asking her a lot of questions. But they always treated her kindly. She told her story again, this time right from the beginning, when Patrick had come in, and she was sewing, and he was tired, so tired he hadn't wanted to go out for supper. She told how she'd put the meat in the oven-\\\"it's there now, cooking\\\"- and how she'd slopped out to the grocer for vegetables, and come back to find him lying on the floor.\\nWhich grocer?\\\" one of the detectives asked.\\nShe told him, and he turned and whispered something to the other detective who immediately went outside into the street.\\nIn fifteen minutes he was back with a page of notes, and there was more whispering, and through her sobbing she heard a few of the whispered phrases-\\\"...acted quite normal...very cheerful...wanted to give him a good supper...peas...cheesecake...impossible that she...\\\"\\nAfter a while, the photographer and the doctor departed and two other men came in and took the corpse away on a stretcher. Then the fingerprint man went away. The two detectives remained, and so did the two policeman. They were exceptionally nice to her, and Jack Noonan asked if she wouldn't rather go somewhere else, to her sister's house perhaps, or to his own wife who would take care of her and put her up for the night.\\nNo, she said. She didn't feel she could move even a yard at the moment. Would they mind awfully of she stayed just where she was until she felt better. She didn't feel too good at the moment, she really didn't.\\nThen hadn't she better lie down on the bed? Jack Noonan asked.\\nNo, she said. She'd like to stay right where she was, in this chair. A little later, perhaps, when she felt better, she would move.\\nSo they left her there while they went about their business, searching the house. Occasionally on of the detectives asked her another question. Sometimes Jack Noonan spoke at her gently as he passed by. Her husband, he told her, had been killed by a blow on the back of the head administered with a heavy blunt instrument, almost certainly a large piece of metal. They were looking for the weapon. The murderer may have taken it with him, but on the other hand he may have thrown it away or hidden it somewhere on the premises.\\n\\\"It's the old story,\\\" he said. \\\"Get the weapon, and you've got the man.\\\"\\nLater, one of the detectives came up and sat beside her. Did she know, he asked, of anything in the house that could've been used as the weapon? Would she mind having a look around to see if anything was missing-a very big spanner, for example, or a heavy metal vase.\\nThey didn't have any heavy metal vases, she said.\\n\\\"Or a big spanner?\\\"\\nShe didn't think they had a big spanner. But there might be some things like that in the garage.\\nThe search went on. She knew that there were other policemen in the garden all around the house. She could hear their footsteps on the gravel outside, and sometimes she saw a flash of a torch through a chink in the curtains. It began to get late, nearly nine she noticed by the clock on the mantle. The four men searching the rooms seemed to be growing weary, a trifle exasperated.\\n\\\"Jack,\\\" she said, the next tome Sergeant Noonan went by. \\\"Would you mind giving me a drink?\\\"\\n\\\"Sure I'll give you a drink. You mean this whiskey?\\\"\\n\\\"Yes please. But just a small one. It might make me feel better.\\\"\\nHe handed her the glass.\\n\\\"Why don't you have one yourself,\\\" she said. \\\"You must be awfully tired. Please do. You've been very good to me.\\\"\\n\\\"Well,\\\" he answered. \\\"It's not strictly allowed, but I might take just a drop to keep me going.\\\"\\nOne by one the others came in and were persuaded to take a little nip of whiskey. They stood around rather awkwardly with the drinks in their hands, uncomfortable in her presence, trying to say consoling things to her. Sergeant Noonan wandered into the kitchen, come out quickly and said, \\\"Look, Mrs. Maloney. You know that oven of yours is still on, and the meat still inside.\\\"\\n\\\"Oh dear me!\\\" she cried. \\\"So it is!\\\"\\n\\\"I better turn it off for you, hadn't I?\\\"\\n\\\"Will you do that, Jack. Thank you so much.\\\"\\nWhen the sergeant returned the second time, she looked at him with her large, dark tearful eyes. \\\"Jack Noonan,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"Yes?\\\"\\n\\\"Would you do me a small favor-you and these others?\\\"\\n\\\"We can try, Mrs. Maloney.\\\"\\n\\\"Well,\\\" she said. \\\"Here you all are, and good friends of dear Patrick's too, and helping to catch the man who killed him. You must be terrible hungry by now because it's long past your suppertime, and I know Patrick would never forgive me, God bless his soul, if I allowed you to remain in his house without offering you decent hospitality. Why don't you eat up that lamb that's in the oven. It'll be cooked just right by now.\\\"\\n\\\"Wouldn't dream of it,\\\" Sergeant Noonan said.\\n\\\"Please,\\\" she begged. \\\"Please eat it. Personally I couldn't tough a thing, certainly not what's been in the house when he was here. But it's all right for you. It'd be a favor to me if you'd eat it up. Then you can go on with your work again afterwards.\\\"\\nThere was a good deal of hesitating among the four policemen, but they were clearly hungry, and in the end they were persuaded to go into the kitchen and help themselves. The woman stayed where she was, listening to them speaking among themselves, their voices thick and sloppy because their mouths were full of meat.\\n\\\"Have some more, Charlie?\\\"\\n\\\"No. Better not finish it.\\\"\\n\\\"She wants us to finish it. She said so. Be doing her a favor.\\\"\\n\\\"Okay then. Give me some more.\\\"\\n\\\"That's the hell of a big club the gut must've used to hit poor Patrick,\\\" one of them was saying. \\\"The doc says his skull was smashed all to pieces just like from a sledgehammer.\\\"\\n\\\"That's why it ought to be easy to find.\\\"\\n\\\"Exactly what I say.\\\"\\n\\\"Whoever done it, they're not going to be carrying a thing like that around with them longer than they need.\\\"\\nOne of them belched.\\n\\\"Personally, I think it's right here on the premises.\\\"\\n\\\"Probably right under our very noses. What you think, Jack?\\\"\\nAnd in the other room, Mary Maloney began to giggle.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Mary Maloney is at home, waiting for her husband Patrick to come home from work.

Now she was resting in her bed, lying on her back, her eyes closed, her features calm, her long white hair carefully arranged as though she had done it up ten minutes before dying. The whole pale countenance of the dead woman was so collected, so calm, so resigned that one could feel what a sweet soul had lived in that body, what a quiet existence this old soul had led, how easy and pure the death of this parent had been.\\nKneeling beside the bed, her son, a magistrate with inflexible principles, and her daughter, Marguerite, known as Sister Eulalie, were weeping as though their hearts would break. She had, from childhood up, armed them with a strict moral code, teaching them religion, without weakness, and duty, without compromise. He, the man, had become a judge and handled the law as a weapon with which he smote the weak ones without pity. She, the girl, influenced by the virtue which had bathed her in this austere family, had become the bride of the Church through her loathing for man.\\nThey had hardly known their father, knowing only that he had made their mother most unhappy, without being told any other details.\\nThe nun was wildly-kissing the dead woman's hand, an ivory hand as white as the large crucifix lying across the bed. On the other side of the long body the other hand seemed still to be holding the sheet in the death grasp; and the sheet had preserved the little creases as a memory of those last movements which precede eternal immobility.\\nA few light taps on the door caused the two sobbing heads to look up, and the priest, who had just come from dinner, returned. He was red and out of breath from his interrupted digestion, for he had made himself a strong mixture of coffee and brandy in order to combat the fatigue of the last few nights and of the wake which was beginning.\\nHe looked sad, with that assumed sadness of the priest for whom death is a bread winner. He crossed himself and approaching with his professional gesture: \\\"Well, my poor children! I have come to help you pass these last sad hours.\\\" But Sister Eulalie suddenly arose. \\\"Thank you, \\\"father, but my brother and I prefer to remain alone with her. This is our last chance to see her, and we wish to be together, all three of us, as we--we--used to be when we were small and our poor mo--mother----\\\"\\nGrief and tears stopped her; she could not continue.\\nOnce more serene, the priest bowed, thinking of his bed. \\\"As you wish, my children.\\\" He kneeled, crossed himself, prayed, arose and went out quietly, murmuring: \\\"She was a saint!\\\"\\nThey remained alone, the dead woman and her children. The ticking of the clock, hidden in the shadow, could be heard distinctly, and through the open window drifted in the sweet smell of hay and of woods, together with the soft moonlight. No other noise could be heard over the land except the occasional croaking of the frog or the chirping of some belated insect. An infinite peace, a divine melancholy, a silent serenity surrounded this dead woman, seemed to be breathed out from her and to appease nature itself.\\nThen the judge, still kneeling, his head buried in the bed clothes, cried in a voice altered by grief and deadened by the sheets and blankets: \\\"Mamma, mamma, mamma!\\\" And his sister, frantically striking her forehead against the woodwork, convulsed, twitching and trembling as in an epileptic fit, moaned: \\\"Jesus, Jesus, mamma, Jesus!\\\" And both of them, shaken by a storm of grief, gasped and choked.\\nThe crisis slowly calmed down and they began to weep quietly, just as on the sea when a calm follows a squall.\\nA rather long time passed and they arose and looked at their dead. And the memories, those distant memories, yesterday so dear, to-day so torturing, came to their minds with all the little forgotten details, those little intimate familiar details which bring back to life the one who has left. They recalled to each other circumstances, words, smiles, intonations of the mother who was no longer to speak to them. They saw her again happy and calm. They remembered things which she had said, and a little motion of the hand, like beating time, which she often used when emphasizing something important.\\nAnd they loved her as they never had loved her before. They measured the depth of their grief, and thus they discovered how lonely they would find themselves.\\nIt was their prop, their guide, their whole youth, all the best part of their lives which was disappearing. It was their bond with life, their mother, their mamma, the connecting link with their forefathers which they would thenceforth miss. They now became solitary, lonely beings; they could no longer look back.\\nThe nun said to her brother: \\\"You remember how mamma used always to read her old letters; they are all there in that drawer. Let us, in turn, read them; let us live her whole life through tonight beside her! It would be like a road to the cross, like making the acquaintance of her mother, of our grandparents, whom we never knew, but whose letters are there and of whom she so often spoke, do you remember?\\\"\\nOut of the drawer they took about ten little packages of yellow paper, tied with care and arranged one beside the other. They threw these relics on the bed and chose one of them on which the word \\\"Father\\\" was written. They opened and read it.\\nIt was one of those old-fashioned letters which one finds in old family desk drawers, those epistles which smell of another century. The first one started: \\\"My dear,\\\" another one: \\\"My beautiful little girl,\\\" others: \\\"My dear child,\\\" or: \\\"My dear daughter.\\\" And suddenly the nun began to read aloud, to read over to the dead woman her whole history, all her tender memories. The judge, resting his elbow on the bed, was listening with his eyes fastened on his mother. The motionless body seemed happy.\\nSister Eulalie, interrupting herself, said suddenly:\\n\\\"These ought to be put in the grave with her; they ought to be used as a shroud and she ought to be buried in it.\\\" She took another package, on which no name was written. She began to read in a firm voice: \\\"My adored one, I love you wildly. Since yesterday I have been suffering the tortures of the damned, haunted by our memory. I feel your lips against mine, your eyes in mine, your breast against mine. I love you, I love you! You have driven me mad. My arms open, I gasp, moved by a wild desire to hold you again. My whole soul and body cries out for you, wants you. I have kept in my mouth the taste of your kisses--\\\"\\nThe judge had straightened himself up. The nun stopped reading. He snatched the letter from her and looked for the signature. There was none, but only under the words, \\\"The man who adores you,\\\" the name \\\"Henry.\\\" Their father's name was Rene. Therefore this was not from him. The son then quickly rummaged through the package of letters, took one out and read: \\\"I can no longer live without your caresses.\\\" Standing erect, severe as when sitting on the bench, he looked unmoved at the dead woman. The nun, straight as a statue, tears trembling in the corners of her eyes, was watching her brother, waiting. Then he crossed the room slowly, went to the window and stood there, gazing out into the dark night.\\nWhen he turned around again Sister Eulalie, her eyes dry now, was still standing near the bed, her head bent down.\\nHe stepped forward, quickly picked up the letters and threw them pell-mell back into the drawer. Then he closed the curtains of the bed.\\nWhen daylight made the candles on the table turn pale the son slowly left his armchair, and without looking again at the mother upon whom he had passed sentence, severing the tie that united her to son and daughter, he said slowly: \\\"Let us now retire, sister.\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story centers around the death of an elderly woman, who is described as having led a blameless and peaceful life.

B. white\", \"story\": \"Everything he kept saying is something it isn't. And everybody is always somewhere else. Maybe it was the city, being in the city, that made him feel how queer everything was and that it was something else. Maybe he kept thinking it was the names of the things. The names were tex and frequently koid. Or they were flex and oid or they were duroid sand or flexsan duro, but everything was glass but not quite glass and the thing that you touched the surface, washable, crease-resistant was rubber, only it wasn't quite rubber and you didn't quite touch it but almost. The wall, which was glass but turned out on being approached not to be a wall, it was something else, it was an opening or doorway--and the doorway through which he saw himself approaching turned out to be something else, it was a wall. And what he had eaten not having agreed with him.\\nHe was in a washable house, but he wasn't sure. Now about those rats, he kept saying to himself. He meant the rats that the Professor had driven crazy by forcing them to deal with problems which were beyond the scope of rats, the insoluble problems. He meant the rats that had been trained to jump at the square card with the circle in the middle, and the card because it was something it wasn't would give way and let the rat into a place where the food was, but then one day it would be a trick played on the rat, and the card would be changed, and the rat would jump but the card wouldn't give way, and it was an impossible situation for a rat and the rat would go insane and into its eyes would come the unspeakably bright imploring look of the frustrated, and after the convulsions were over and the frantic racing around, then the passive stage would set in and the willingness to let anything be done to it, even if it was something else.\\nHe didn't know which door or wall or opening in the house to jump at, to get through, because one was an opening that wasn't a door it was a void, or kid and the other was a wall that wasn't an opening, it was a sanitary cupboard of the same color. He caught a glimpse of his eyes staring into his eyes, in the and in them was the expression he had seen in the picture of the rats--weary after convulsions and the frantic racing around, when they were willing and did not mind having anything done to them. More and more he kept saying I am confronted by a problem which is incapable of solution for this time even if he chose the right door, there would be no food behind it and that is what madness is, and things seeming different from what they are. He heard, in the house where he was, in the city to which he had gone as toward a door which might, or might not, give way, a noise--not a loud noise but more of a low prefabricated humming. It came from a place in the base of the wall or stat where the flue carrying the filterable air was, and not far from the Minipiano, which was made of the same material nailbrushes are made of, and which was under the stairs. \\\"This, too, has been tested,\\\" she said, pointing, but not at it, \\\"and found viable.\\\" It wasn't a loud noise, he kept thinking, sorry that he had seen his eyes, even though it was through his own eyes that he had seen them.\\nFirst will come the convulsions he said, then the exhaustion, then the willingness to let anything be done. \\\"And you better believe it will be.\\\"\\nAll his life he had been confronted by situations which were incapable of being solved, and there was a deliberateness behind all this, behind this changing of the card or door, because they would always wait until you had learned to jump at the certain card or door--the one with the circle--and then they would change it on you. There have been so many doors changed on me, he said, in the last twenty years, but it is now becoming clear that it is an impossible situation, and the question is whether to jump again, even though they ruffle you in the rump with a blast of air--to make you jump. He wished he wasn't standing by the Minipiano. First they would teach you the prayers and the Psalms, and that would be the right doorthe one with the circle and the long sweet words with the holy sound, and that would be the one to jump at to get where the food was. Then one day you jumped and it didn't give way, so that all you got was the bump on the nose, and the first bewilderment, the first young bewilderment.\\nI don't know whether to tell her about the door they substituted or not, he said, the one with the equation on it and the picture of the amoeba reproducing itself by division. Or the one with the photostatic copy of the check for thirty-two dollars and fifty cents. But the jumping was so long ago, although the bump is . . . how those old wounds hurt! Being crazy this way wouldn't be so bad if only, if only. If only when you put your foot forward to take a step, the ground wouldn't come up to meet your foot the way it does. And the same way in the street only I may never get back to the street unless I jump at the right door, the curb coming up to meet your foot, anticipating ever so delicately the weight of the body, which is somewhere else. \\\"We could take your name,\\\" she said, \\\"and send it to you.\\\" And it wouldn't be so bad if only you could read a sentence all the way through without jumping your eye to something else on the same page; and then he kept thinking there was that man out in Jersey, the one who started to chop his trees down, one by one, the man who began talking about how he would take his house to pieces, brick by brick, because he faced a problem incapable of solution, probably, so he began to hack at the trees in the yard, began to pluck with trembling fingers at the bricks in the house. Even if a house is not washable, it is worth taking down. It is not till later that the exhaustion sets in.\\nBut it is inevitable that they will keep changing the doors on you, he said, because that is what they are for; and the thing is to get used to it and not let it unsettle the mind. But that would mean not jumping, and you can't. Nobody can not jump. There will be no not-jumping. Among rats, perhaps, but among people never. Everybody has to keep jumping at a door the one with the circle on it because that is the way everybody is, especially some people. You wouldn't want me, standing here, to tell you, would you, about my friend the poet deceased who said, \\\"My heart has followed all my days something I cannot name\\\"? It had the circle on it. And like many poets, although few so beloved, he is gone. It killed him, the jumping. First, of course, there were the preliminary bouts, the convulsions, and the calm and the willingness.\\nI remember the door with the picture of the girl on it only it was spring, her arms outstretched in loveliness, her dress it was the one with the circle on it uncaught, beginning the slow, clear, blinding cascade-and I guess we would all like to try that door again, for it seemed like the way and for a while it was the way, the door would open and you would go through winged and exalted like any rat and the food would be there, the way the Professor had it arranged, everything O.K., and you had chosen the right door for the world was young. The time they changed that door on me, my nose bled for a hundred hours--how do you like that, Madam? Or would you prefer to show me further through this so strange house, or you could take my name and send it to me, for although my heart has followed all my days something I cannot name, I am tired of the jumping and I do not know which way to go, Madam, and I am not even sure that I am not tired beyond the endurance of man rat, if you will and have taken leave of sanity. What are you following these days, old friend, after your recovery from the last bump? What is the name, or is it something you cannot name? The rats have a name for it by this time, perhaps, but I don't know what they call it. I call it and it comes in sheets, something like insulating board, unattainable and ugli-proof.\\nAnd there was the man out in Jersey, because I keep thinking about his terrible necessity and the passion and trouble he had gone to all those years in the indescribable abundance of a householder's detail, building the estate and the planting of the trees and in spring the lawn-dressing and in fall the bulbs for the spring burgeoning, and the watering of the grass on the long light evenings in summer and the gravel for the driveway all had to be thought out, planned and the decorative borders, probably, the perennials and the bug spray, and the building of the house from plans of the architect, first the sills, then the studs, then the full corn in the ear, the floors laid on the floor timbers, smoothed, and then the carpets upon the smooth floors and the curtains and the rods therefor. And then, almost without warning, he would be jumping at the same old door and it wouldn't give: they had changed it on him, making life no longer supportable under the elms in the elm shade, under the maples in the maple shade.\\n\\\"Here you have the maximum of openness in a small room.\\\"\\nIt was impossible to say maybe it was the city what made him feel the way he did, and I am not the only one either, he kept thinking--ask any doctor if I am. The doctors, they know how many there are, they even know where the trouble is only they don't like to tell you about the prefrontal lobe because that means making a hole in your skull and removing the work of centuries. It took so long coming, this lobe, so many, many years. Is it something you read in the paper, perhaps? And now, the strain being so great, the door having been changed by the Professor once too often . . . but it only means a whiff of ether, a few deft strokes, and the higher animal becomes a little easier in his mind and more like the lower one. From now on, you see, that's the way it will be, the ones with the small prefrontal lobes will win because the other ones are hurt too much by this incessant bumping. They can stand just so much, em, Doctor? And what is that, pray, that you have in your hand? Still, you never can tell, em, Madam?\\nHe crossed carefully the room, the thick carpet under him softly, and went toward the door carefully, which was glass and he could see himself in it, and which, at his approach, opened to allow him to pass through; and beyond he half expected to find one of the old doors that he had known, perhaps the one with the circle, the one with the girl her arms outstretched in loveliness and beauty before him.

He was stylish, although in a provincial way; but, nevertheless, he was stylish--a rare thing at Boutigny-le-Rebours.\\nMademoiselle Cordier was graceful and fresh-looking, although a trifle awkward; nevertheless, she was a handsome girl, and one to be desired.\\nThe marriage ceremony turned all Boutigny topsy-turvy. Everybody admired the young couple, who quickly returned home to domestic felicity, having decided simply to take a short trip to Paris, after a few days of retirement.\\nThis tete-a-tete was delightful, Maitre Lebrument having shown just the proper amount of delicacy. He had taken as his motto: \\\"Everything comes to him who waits.\\\" He knew how to be at the same time patient and energetic. His success was rapid and complete.\\nAfter four days, Madame Lebrument adored her husband. She could not get along without him. She would sit on his knees, and taking him by the ears she would say: \\\"Open your mouth and shut your eyes.\\\" He would open his mouth wide and partly close his eyes, and he would try to nip her fingers as she slipped some dainty between his teeth. Then she would give him a kiss, sweet and long, which would make chills run up and down his spine.

Mathurin kept pouring and winking to the saloon keeper, a big, red-faced man, who chuckled as though at the thought of some fine joke; and Jeremie kept absorbing alcohol and wagging his head, giving vent to a roar of laughter and looking at his comrade with a stupid and contented expression.\\nAll the customers were going away. Every time that one of them would open the door to leave a gust of wind would blow into the caf\\u00e9, making the tobacco smoke swirl around, swinging the lamps at the end of their chains and making their flames flicker, and suddenly one could hear the deep booming of a breaking wave and the moaning of the wind.\\nJeremie, his collar unbuttoned, was taking drunkard's poses, one leg outstretched, one arm hanging down and in the other hand holding a domino.\\nThey were alone now with the owner, who had come up to them, interested.\\nHe asked:\\n\\\"Well, Jeremie, how goes it inside? Feel less thirsty after wetting your throat?\\\"\\nJeremie muttered:\\n\\\"The more I wet it, the drier it gets inside.\\\"\\nThe innkeeper cast a sly glance at Mathurin. He said:\\n\\\"And your brother, Mathurin, where's he now?\\\"\\nThe sailor laughed silently:\\n\\\"Don't worry; he's warm, all right.\\\"\\nAnd both of them looked toward Jeremie, who was triumphantly putting down the double six and announcing:\\n\\\"Game!\\\"\\nThen the owner declared:\\n\\\"Well, boys, I'm goin' to bed. I will leave you the lamp and the bottle; there's twenty cents' worth in it. Lock the door when you go, Mathurin, and slip the key under the mat the way you did the other night.\\\"\\nMathurin answered:\\n\\\"Don't worry; it'll be all right.\\\"\\nPaumelle shook hands with his two customers and slowly went up the wooden stairs. For several minutes his heavy step echoed through the little house. Then a loud creaking announced that he had got into bed.\\nThe two men continued to play. From time to time a more violent gust of wind would shake the whole house, and the two drinkers would look up, as though some one were about to enter. Then Mathurin would take the bottle and fill Jeremie's glass. But suddenly the clock over the bar struck twelve. Its hoarse clang sounded like the rattling of saucepans. Then Mathurin got up like a sailor whose watch is over.\\n\\\"Come on, Jeremie, we've got to get out.\\\"\\nThe other man rose to his feet with difficulty, got his balance by leaning on the table, reached the door and opened it while his companion was putting out the light.\\nAs soon as they were in the street Mathurin locked the door and then said:\\n\\\"Well, so long. See you to-morrow night!\\\"\\nAnd he disappeared in the darkness.\\nJeremie took a few steps, staggered, stretched out his hands, met a wall which supported him and began to stumble along. From time to time a gust of wind would sweep through the street, pushing him forward, making him run for a few steps; then, when the wind would die down, he would stop short, having lost his impetus, and once more he would begin to stagger on his unsteady drunkard's legs.\\nHe went instinctively toward his home, just as birds go to their nests. Finally he recognized his door, and began to feel about for the keyhole and tried to put the key in it. Not finding the hole, he began to swear. Then he began to beat on the door with his fists, calling for his wife to come and help him:\\n\\\"Melina! Oh, Melina!\\\"\\nAs he leaned against the door for support, it gave way and opened, and Jeremie, losing his prop, fell inside, rolling on his face into the middle of his room, and he felt something heavy pass over him and escape in the night.\\nHe was no longer moving, dazed by fright, bewildered, fearing the devil, ghosts, all the mysterious beings of darkness, and he waited a long time without daring to move. But when he found out that nothing else was moving, a little reason returned to him, the reason of a drunkard.\\nGently he sat up. Again he waited a long time, and at last, growing bolder, he called:\\n\\\"Melina!\\\"\\nHis wife did not answer.\\nThen, suddenly, a suspicion crossed his darkened mind, an indistinct, vague suspicion. He was not moving; he was sitting there in the dark, trying to gather together his scattered wits, his mind stumbling over incomplete ideas, just as his feet stumbled along.\\nOnce more he asked:\\n\\\"Who was it, Melina? Tell me who it was. I won't hurt you!\\\"\\nHe waited, no voice was raised in the darkness. He was now reasoning with himself out loud.\\n\\\"I'm drunk, all right! I'm drunk! And he filled me up, the dog; he did it, to stop my goin' home. I'm drunk!\\\"\\nAnd he would continue:\\n\\\"Tell me who it was, Melina, or somethin'll happen to you.\\\"\\nAfter having waited again, he went on with the slow and obstinate logic of a drunkard:\\n\\\"He's been keeping me at that loafer Paumelle's place every night, so as to stop my going home. It's some trick. Oh, you damned carrion!\\\"\\nSlowly he got on his knees. A blind fury was gaining possession of him, mingling with the fumes of alcohol.\\nHe continued:\\n\\\"Tell me who it was, Melina, or you'll get a licking--I warn you!\\\"\\nHe was now standing, trembling with a wild fury, as though the alcohol had set his blood on fire. He took a step, knocked against a chair, seized it, went on, reached the bed, ran his hands over it and felt the warm body of his wife.\\nThen, maddened, he roared:\\n\\\"So! You were there, you piece of dirt, and you wouldn't answer!\\\"\\nAnd, lifting the chair, which he was holding in his strong sailor's grip, he swung it down before him with an exasperated fury. A cry burst from the bed, an agonizing, piercing cry. Then he began to thrash around like a thresher in a barn. And soon nothing more moved. The chair was broken to pieces, but he still held one leg and beat away with it, panting.\\nAt last he stopped to ask:\\n\\\"Well, are you ready to tell me who it was?\\\"\\nMelina did not answer.\\nThen tired out, stupefied from his exertion, he stretched himself out on the ground and slept.\\nWhen day came a neighbor, seeing the door open, entered. He saw Jeremie snoring on the floor, amid the broken pieces of a chair, and on the bed a pulp of flesh and blood.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In a small village called Yport, a violent storm is raging, with heavy rain and strong winds.

At one time he was my most intimate friend, the friend who knows one's thoughts, with whom one passes long, quiet, happy evenings, to whom one tells one's secret love affairs, and who seems to draw out those rare, ingenious, delicate thoughts born of that sympathy that gives a sense of repose.\\nFor years we had scarcely been separated; we had lived, travelled, thought and dreamed together; had liked the same things, had admired the same books, understood the same authors, trembled with the same sensations, and very often laughed at the same individuals, whom we understood completely by merely exchanging a glance.\\nThen he married. He married, quite suddenly, a little girl from the provinces, who had come to Paris in search of a husband. How in the world could that little thin, insipidly fair girl, with her weak hands, her light, vacant eyes, and her clear, silly voice, who was exactly like a hundred thousand marriageable dolls, have picked up that intelligent, clever young fellow? Can any one understand these things? No doubt he had hoped for happiness, simple, quiet and long-enduring happiness, in the arms of a good, tender and faithful woman; he had seen all that in the transparent looks of that schoolgirl with light hair.\\nHe had not dreamed of the fact that an active, living and vibrating man grows weary of everything as soon as he understands the stupid reality, unless, indeed, he becomes so brutalized that he understands nothing whatever.\\nWhat would he be like when I met him again? Still lively, witty, light- hearted and enthusiastic, or in a state of mental torpor induced by provincial life? A man may change greatly in the course of fifteen years!\\nThe train stopped at a small station, and as I got out of the carriage, a stout, a very stout man with red cheeks and a big stomach rushed up to me with open arms, exclaiming: \\\"George!\\\" I embraced him, but I had not recognized him, and then I said, in astonishment: \\\"By Jove! You have not grown thin!\\\" And he replied with a laugh:\\n\\\"What did you expect? Good living, a good table and good nights! Eating and sleeping, that is my existence!\\\"\\nI looked at him closely, trying to discover in that broad face the features I held so dear. His eyes alone had not changed, but I no longer saw the same expression in them, and I said to myself: \\\"If the expression be the reflection of the mind, the thoughts in that head are not what they used to be formerly; those thoughts which I knew so well.\\\"\\nYet his eyes were bright, full of happiness and friendship, but they had not that clear, intelligent expression which shows as much as words the brightness of the intellect. Suddenly he said:\\n\\\"Here are my two eldest children.\\\" A girl of fourteen, who was almost a woman, and a boy of thirteen, in the dress of a boy from a Lycee, came forward in a hesitating and awkward manner, and I said in a low voice: \\\"Are they yours?\\\" \\\"Of course they are,\\\" he replied, laughing. \\\"How many have you?\\\" \\\"Five! There are three more at home.\\\"\\nHe said this in a proud, self-satisfied, almost triumphant manner, and I felt profound pity, mingled with a feeling of vague contempt, for this vainglorious and simple reproducer of his species.\\nI got into a carriage which he drove himself, and we set off through the town, a dull, sleepy, gloomy town where nothing was moving in the streets except a few dogs and two or three maidservants. Here and there a shopkeeper, standing at his door, took off his hat, and Simon returned his salute and told me the man's name; no doubt to show me that he knew all the inhabitants personally, and the thought struck me that he was thinking of becoming a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies, that dream of all those who bury themselves in the provinces.\\nWe were soon out of the town, and the carriage turned into a garden that was an imitation of a park, and stopped in front of a turreted house, which tried to look like a chateau.\\n\\\"That is my den,\\\" said Simon, so that I might compliment him on it. \\\"It is charming,\\\" I replied.\\nA lady appeared on the steps, dressed for company, and with company phrases all ready prepared. She was no longer the light-haired, insipid girl I had seen in church fifteen years previously, but a stout lady in curls and flounces, one of those ladies of uncertain age, without intellect, without any of those things that go to make a woman. In short, she was a mother, a stout, commonplace mother, a human breeding machine which procreates without any other preoccupation but her children and her cook-book.\\nShe welcomed me, and I went into the hall, where three children, ranged according to their height, seemed set out for review, like firemen before a mayor, and I said: \\\"Ah! ah! so there are the others?\\\" Simon, radiant with pleasure, introduced them: \\\"Jean, Sophie and Gontran.\\\"\\nThe door of the drawing-room was open. I went in, and in the depths of an easy-chair, I saw something trembling, a man, an old, paralyzed man. Madame Radevin came forward and said: \\\"This is my grandfather, monsieur; he is eighty-seven.\\\" And then she shouted into the shaking old man's ears: \\\"This is a friend of Simon's, papa.\\\" The old gentleman tried to say \\\"good-day\\\" to me, and he muttered: \\\"Oua, oua, oua,\\\" and waved his hand, and I took a seat saying: \\\"You are very kind, monsieur.\\\"\\nSimon had just come in, and he said with a laugh: \\\"So! You have made grandpapa's acquaintance. He is a treasure, that old man; he is the delight of the children. But he is so greedy that he almost kills himself at every meal; you have no idea what he would eat if he were allowed to do as he pleased. But you will see, you will see. He looks at all the sweets as if they were so many girls. You never saw anything so funny; you will see presently.\\\"\\nI was then shown to my room, to change my dress for dinner, and hearing a great clatter behind me on the stairs, I turned round and saw that all the children were following me behind their father; to do me honor, no doubt.\\nMy windows looked out across a dreary, interminable plain, an ocean of grass, of wheat and of oats, without a clump of trees or any rising ground, a striking and melancholy picture of the life which they must be leading in that house.\\nA bell rang; it was for dinner, and I went downstairs. Madame Radevin took my arm in a ceremonious manner, and we passed into the dining-room. A footman wheeled in the old man in his armchair. He gave a greedy and curious look at the dessert, as he turned his shaking head with difficulty from one dish to the other.\\nSimon rubbed his hands: \\\"You will be amused,\\\" he said; and all the children understanding that I was going to be indulged with the sight of their greedy grandfather, began to laugh, while their mother merely smiled and shrugged her shoulders, and Simon, making a speaking trumpet of his hands, shouted at the old man: \\\"This evening there is sweet creamed rice!\\\" The wrinkled face of the grandfather brightened, and he trembled more violently, from head to foot, showing that he had understood and was very pleased. The dinner began.\\n\\\"Just look!\\\" Simon whispered. The old man did not like the soup, and refused to eat it; but he was obliged to do it for the good of his health, and the footman forced the spoon into his mouth, while the old man blew so energetically, so as not to swallow the soup, that it was scattered like a spray all over the table and over his neighbors. The children writhed with laughter at the spectacle, while their father, who was also amused, said: \\\"Is not the old man comical?\\\"\\nDuring the whole meal they were taken up solely with him. He devoured the dishes on the table with his eyes, and tried to seize them and pull them over to him with his trembling hands. They put them almost within his reach, to see his useless efforts, his trembling clutches at them, the piteous appeal of his whole nature, of his eyes, of his mouth and of his nose as he smelt them, and he slobbered on his table napkin with eagerness, while uttering inarticulate grunts. And the whole family was highly amused at this horrible and grotesque scene.\\nThen they put a tiny morsel on his plate, and he ate with feverish gluttony, in order to get something more as soon as possible, and when the sweetened rice was brought in, he nearly had a fit, and groaned with greediness, and Gontran called out to him:\\n\\\"You have eaten too much already; you can have no more.\\\" And they pretended not to give him any. Then he began to cry; he cried and trembled more violently than ever, while all the children laughed. At last, however, they gave him his helping, a very small piece; and as he ate the first mouthful, he made a comical noise in his throat, and a movement with his neck as ducks do when they swallow too large a morsel, and when he had swallowed it, he began to stamp his feet, so as to get more.\\nI was seized with pity for this saddening and ridiculous Tantalus, and interposed on his behalf:\\n\\\"Come, give him a little more rice!\\\" But Simon replied: \\\"Oh! no, my dear fellow, if he were to eat too much, it would harm him, at his age.\\\"\\nI held my tongue, and thought over those words. Oh, ethics! Oh, logic! Oh, wisdom! At his age! So they deprived him of his only remaining pleasure out of regard for his health! His health! What would he do with it, inert and trembling wreck that he was? They were taking care of his life, so they said. His life? How many days? Ten, twenty, fifty, or a hundred? Why? For his own sake? Or to preserve for some time longer the spectacle of his impotent greediness in the family.\\nThere was nothing left for him to do in this life, nothing whatever. He had one single wish left, one sole pleasure; why not grant him that last solace until he died?\\nAfter we had played cards for a long time, I went up to my room and to bed; I was low-spirited and sad, sad, sad! and I sat at my window. Not a sound could be heard outside but the beautiful warbling of a bird in a tree, somewhere in the distance. No doubt the bird was singing in a low voice during the night, to lull his mate, who was asleep on her eggs. And I thought of my poor friend's five children, and pictured him to myself, snoring by the side of his ugly wife.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The narrator goes to visit their old friend, Simon Radevin, whom they haven't seen in fifteen years.

Through the caf\\u00e9 windows they could see the Boulevard, crowded with people. They could feel the gentle breezes which are wafted over Paris on warm summer evenings and make you feel like going out somewhere, you care not where, under the trees, and make you dream of moonlit rivers, of fireflies and of larks.\\nOne of the two, Henri Simon, heaved a deep sigh and said:\\n\\\"Ah! I am growing old. It's sad. Formerly, on evenings like this, I felt full of life. Now, I only feel regrets. Life is short!\\\"\\nHe was perhaps forty-five years old, very bald and already growing stout.\\nThe other, Pierre Carnier, a trifle older, but thin and lively, answered:\\n\\\"Well, my boy, I have grown old without noticing it in the least. I have always been merry, healthy, vigorous and all the rest. As one sees oneself in the mirror every day, one does not realize the work of age, for it is slow, regular, and it modifies the countenance so gently that the changes are unnoticeable. It is for this reason alone that we do not die of sorrow after two or three years of excitement. For we cannot understand the alterations which time produces. In order to appreciate them one would have to remain six months without seeing one's own face-- then, oh, what a shock!\\n\\\"And the women, my friend, how I pity the poor beings! All their joy, all their power, all their life, lies in their beauty, which lasts ten years.\\n\\\"As I said, I aged without noticing it; I thought myself practically a youth, when I was almost fifty years old. Not feeling the slightest infirmity, I went about, happy and peaceful.\\n\\\"The revelation of my decline came to me in a simple and terrible manner, which overwhelmed me for almost six months--then I became resigned.\\n\\\"Like all men, I have often been in love, but most especially once.\\n\\\"I met her at the seashore, at Etretat, about twelve years ago, shortly after the war. There is nothing prettier than this beach during the morning bathing hour. It is small, shaped like a horseshoe, framed by high while cliffs, which are pierced by strange holes called the 'Portes,' one stretching out into the ocean like the leg of a giant, the other short and dumpy. The women gather on the narrow strip of sand in this frame of high rocks, which they make into a gorgeous garden of beautiful gowns. The sun beats down on the shores, on the multicolored parasols, on the blue-green sea; and all is gay, delightful, smiling. You sit down at the edge of the water and you watch the bathers. The women come down, wrapped in long bath robes, which they throw off daintily when they reach the foamy edge of the rippling waves; and they run into the water with a rapid little step, stopping from time to time for a delightful little thrill from the cold water, a short gasp.\\n\\\"Very few stand the test of the bath. It is there that they can be judged, from the ankle to the throat. Especially on leaving the water are the defects revealed, although water is a powerful aid to flabby skin.\\n\\\"The first time that I saw this young woman in the water, I was delighted, entranced. She stood the test well. There are faces whose charms appeal to you at first glance and delight you instantly. You seem to have found the woman whom you were born to love. I had that feeling and that shock.\\n\\\"I was introduced, and was soon smitten worse than I had ever been before. My heart longed for her. It is a terrible yet delightful thing thus to be dominated by a young woman. It is almost torture, and yet infinite delight. Her look, her smile, her hair fluttering in the wind, the little lines of her face, the slightest movement of her features, delighted me, upset me, entranced me. She had captured me, body and soul, by her gestures, her manners, even by her clothes, which seemed to take on a peculiar charm as soon as she wore them. I grew tender at the sight of her veil on some piece of furniture, her gloves thrown on a chair. Her gowns seemed to me inimitable. Nobody had hats like hers.\\n\\\"She was married, but her husband came only on Saturday, and left on Monday. I didn't concern myself about him, anyhow. I wasn't jealous of him, I don't know why; never did a creature seem to me to be of less importance in life, to attract my attention less than this man.\\n\\\"But she! how I loved her! How beautiful, graceful and young she was! She was youth, elegance, freshness itself! Never before had I felt so strongly what a pretty, distinguished, delicate, charming, graceful being woman is. Never before had I appreciated the seductive beauty to be found in the curve of a cheek, the movement of a lip, the pinkness of an ear, the shape of that foolish organ called the nose.\\n\\\"This lasted three months; then I left for America, overwhelmed with sadness. But her memory remained in me, persistent, triumphant. From far away I was as much hers as I had been when she was near me. Years passed by, and I did not forget her. The charming image of her person was ever before my eyes and in my heart. And my love remained true to her, a quiet tenderness now, something like the beloved memory of the most beautiful and the most enchanting thing I had ever met in my life.\\n\\\"Twelve years are not much in a lifetime! One does not feel them slip by. The years follow each other gently and quickly, slowly yet rapidly, each one is long and yet so soon over! They add up so rapidly, they leave so few traces behind them, they disappear so completely, that, when one turns round to look back over bygone years, one sees nothing and yet one does not understand how one happens to be so old. It seemed to me, really, that hardly a few months separated me from that charming season on the sands of Etretat.\\n\\\"Last spring I went to dine with some friends at Maisons-Laffitte.\\n\\\"Just as the train was leaving, a big, fat lady, escorted by four little girls, got into my car. I hardly looked at this mother hen, very big, very round, with a face as full as the moon framed in an enormous, beribboned hat.\\n\\\"She was puffing, out of breath from having been forced to walk quickly. The children began to chatter. I unfolded my paper and began to read.\\n\\\"We had just passed Asnieres, when my neighbor suddenly turned to me and said:\\n\\\"'Excuse me, sir, but are you not Monsieur Garnier?'\\n\\\"'Yes, madame.'\\n\\\"Then she began to laugh, the pleased laugh of a good woman; and yet it was sad.\\n\\\"'You do not seem to recognize me.'\\n\\\"I hesitated. It seemed to me that I had seen that face somewhere; but where? when? I answered:\\n\\\"'Yes--and no. I certainly know you, and yet I cannot recall your name.'\\n\\\"She blushed a little:\\n\\\"'Madame Julie Lefevre.'\\n\\\"Never had I received such a shock. In a second it seemed to me as though it were all over with me! I felt that a veil had been torn from my eyes and that I was going to make a horrible and heartrending discovery.\\n\\\"So that was she! That big, fat, common woman, she! She had become the mother of these four girls since I had last seen her. And these little beings surprised me as much as their mother. They were part of her; they were big girls, and already had a place in life. Whereas she no longer counted, she, that marvel of dainty and charming gracefulness. It seemed to me that I had seen her but yesterday, and this is how I found her again! Was it possible? A poignant grief seized my heart; and also a revolt against nature herself, an unreasoning indignation against this brutal, injurious act of destruction.\\n\\\"I looked at her, bewildered.

Henry\", \"story\": \"One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one\\u2019s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.\\n\\nThere was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.\\n\\nWhile the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.\\n\\nIn the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name \\u201cMr. James Dillingham Young.\\u201d\\n\\nThe \\u201cDillingham\\u201d had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called \\u201cJim\\u201d and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.\\n\\nDella finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn\\u2019t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling\\u2014something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.\\n\\nThere was a pier glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.\\n\\nSuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.\\n\\nNow, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim\\u2019s gold watch that had been his father\\u2019s and his grandfather\\u2019s. The other was Della\\u2019s hair. Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty\\u2019s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.\\n\\nSo now Della\\u2019s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.\\n\\nOn went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.\\n\\nWhere she stopped the sign read: \\u201cMme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds.\\u201d One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the \\u201cSofronie.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWill you buy my hair?\\u201d asked Della.\\n\\n\\u201cI buy hair,\\u201d said Madame. \\u201cTake yer hat off and let\\u2019s have a sight at the looks of it.\\u201d\\n\\nDown rippled the brown cascade.\\n\\n\\u201cTwenty dollars,\\u201d said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.\\n\\n\\u201cGive it to me quick,\\u201d said Della.\\n\\nOh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim\\u2019s present.\\n\\nShe found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation\\u2014as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim\\u2019s. It was like him. Quietness and value\\u2014the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.\\n\\nWhen Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends\\u2014a mammoth task.\\n\\nWithin forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.\\n\\n\\u201cIf Jim doesn\\u2019t kill me,\\u201d she said to herself, \\u201cbefore he takes a second look at me, he\\u2019ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do\\u2014oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?\\u201d\\n\\nAt 7 o\\u2019clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.\\n\\nJim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: \\u201cPlease God, make him think I am still pretty.\\u201d\\n\\nThe door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two\\u2014and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.\\n\\nJim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.\\n\\nDella wriggled off the table and went for him.\\n\\n\\u201cJim, darling,\\u201d she cried, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold because I couldn\\u2019t have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It\\u2019ll grow out again\\u2014you won\\u2019t mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say \\u2018Merry Christmas!\\u2019 Jim, and let\\u2019s be happy. You don\\u2019t know what a nice\\u2014what a beautiful, nice gift I\\u2019ve got for you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019ve cut off your hair?\\u201d asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.\\n\\n\\u201cCut it off and sold it,\\u201d said Della. \\u201cDon\\u2019t you like me just as well, anyhow? I\\u2019m me without my hair, ain\\u2019t I?\\u201d\\n\\nJim looked about the room curiously.\\n\\n\\u201cYou say your hair is gone?\\u201d he said, with an air almost of idiocy.\\n\\n\\u201cYou needn\\u2019t look for it,\\u201d said Della. \\u201cIt\\u2019s sold, I tell you\\u2014sold and gone, too. It\\u2019s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,\\u201d she went on with sudden serious sweetness, \\u201cbut nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?\\u201d\\n\\nOut of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year\\u2014what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.\\n\\nJim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t make any mistake, Dell,\\u201d he said, \\u201cabout me. I don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you\\u2019ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first.\\u201d\\n\\nWhite fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.\\n\\nFor there lay The Combs\\u2014the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rims\\u2014just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.\\n\\nBut she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: \\u201cMy hair grows so fast, Jim!\\u201d\\n\\nAnd then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, \\u201cOh, oh!\\u201d\\n\\nJim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.\\n\\n\\u201cIsn\\u2019t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You\\u2019ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it.\\u201d\\n\\nInstead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.\\n\\n\\u201cDell,\\u201d said he, \\u201clet\\u2019s put our Christmas presents away and keep \\u2019em a while. They\\u2019re too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.\\u201d\\n\\nThe magi, as you know, were wise men\\u2014wonderfully wise men\\u2014who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house.

The ticket is yours, but if it were mine I should, first of all, of course, spend twenty-five thousand on real property in the shape of an estate; ten thousand on immediate expenses, new furnishing . . . travelling . . . paying debts, and so on. . . . The other forty thousand I would put in the bank and get interest on it.\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, an estate, that would be nice,\\\" said his wife, sitting down and dropping her hands in her lap.\\n\\\"Somewhere in the Tula or Oryol provinces. . . . In the first place we shouldn't need a summer villa, and besides, it would always bring in an income.\\\"\\nAnd pictures came crowding on his imagination, each more gracious and poetical than the last. And in all these pictures he saw himself well-fed, serene, healthy, felt warm, even hot! Here, after eating a summer soup, cold as ice, he lay on his back on the burning sand close to a stream or in the garden under a lime-tree. . . . It is hot. . . . His little boy and girl are crawling about near him, digging in the sand or catching ladybirds in the grass. He dozes sweetly, thinking of nothing, and feeling all over that he need not go to the office today, tomorrow, or the day after. Or, tired of lying still, he goes to the hayfield, or to the forest for mushrooms, or watches the peasants catching fish with a net. When the sun sets he takes a towel and soap and saunters to the bathing shed, where he undresses at his leisure, slowly rubs his bare chest with his hands, and goes into the water. And in the water, near the opaque soapy circles, little fish flit to and fro and green water-weeds nod their heads. After bathing there is tea with cream and milk rolls. . . . In the evening a walk or vint with the neighbors.\\n\\\"Yes, it would be nice to buy an estate,\\\" said his wife, also dreaming, and from her face it was evident that she was enchanted by her thoughts.\\nIvan Dmitritch pictured to himself autumn with its rains, its cold evenings, and its St. Martin's summer. At that season he would have to take longer walks about the garden and beside the river, so as to get thoroughly chilled, and then drink a big glass of vodka and eat a salted mushroom or a soused cucumber, and then--drink another. . . . The children would come running from the kitchen-garden, bringing a carrot and a radish smelling of fresh earth. . . . And then, he would lie stretched full length on the sofa, and in leisurely fashion turn over the pages of some illustrated magazine, or, covering his face with it and unbuttoning his waistcoat, give himself up to slumber.\\nThe St. Martin's summer is followed by cloudy, gloomy weather. It rains day and night, the bare trees weep, the wind is damp and cold. The dogs, the horses, the fowls--all are wet, depressed, downcast. There is nowhere to walk; one can't go out for days together; one has to pace up and down the room, looking despondently at the grey window. It is dreary!\\nIvan Dmitritch stopped and looked at his wife.\\n\\\"I should go abroad, you know, Masha,\\\" he said.\\nAnd he began thinking how nice it would be in late autumn to go abroad somewhere to the South of France ... to Italy ... to India!\\n\\\"I should certainly go abroad too,\\\" his wife said. \\\"But look at the number of the ticket!\\\"\\n\\\"Wait, wait! ...\\\"\\nHe walked about the room and went on thinking. It occurred to him: what if his wife really did go abroad? It is pleasant to travel alone, or in the society of light, careless women who live in the present, and not such as think and talk all the journey about nothing but their children, sigh, and tremble with dismay over every farthing. Ivan Dmitritch imagined his wife in the train with a multitude of parcels, baskets, and bags; she would be sighing over something, complaining that the train made her head ache, that she had spent so much money.... At the stations he would continually be having to run for boiling water, bread and butter. ...She wouldn't have dinner because of its being too dear....\\n\\\"She would begrudge me every farthing,\\\" he thought, with a glance at his wife. \\\"The lottery ticket is hers, not mine! Besides, what is the use of her going abroad? What does she want there? She would shut herself up in the hotel, and not let me out of her sight.... I know!\\\"\\nAnd for the first time in his life his mind dwelt on the fact that his wife had grown elderly and plain, and that she was saturated through and through with the smell of cooking, while he was still young, fresh, and healthy, and might well have got married again.\\n\\\"Of course, all that is silly nonsense,\\\" he thought; \\\"but...why should she go abroad? What would she make of it? And yet she would go, of course.... I can fancy.... In reality it is all one to her, whether it is Naples or Klin. She would only be in my way. I should be dependent upon her. I can fancy how, like a regular woman, she will lock the money up as soon as she gets it.... She will look after her relations and grudge me every farthing.\\\"\\nIvan Dmitritch thought of her relations. All those wretched brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles would come crawling about as soon as they heard of the winning ticket, would begin whining like beggars, and fawning upon them with oily, hypocritical smiles. Wretched, detestable people! If they were given anything, they would ask for more; while if they were refused, they would swear at them, slander them, and wish them every kind of misfortune.\\nIvan Dmitritch remembered his own relations, and their faces, at which he had looked impartially in the past, struck him now as repulsive and hateful.\\n\\\"They are such reptiles!\\\" he thought.\\nAnd his wife's face, too, struck him as repulsive and hateful. Anger surged up in his heart against her, and he thought malignantly:\\n\\\"She knows nothing about money, and so she is stingy. If she won it she would give me a hundred roubles, and put the rest away under lock and key.\\\"\\nAnd he looked at his wife, not with a smile now, but with hatred. She glanced at him too, and also with hatred and anger. She had her own daydreams, her own plans, her own reflections; she understood perfectly well what her husband's dreams were. She knew who would be the first to try to grab her winnings.\\n\\\"It's very nice making daydreams at other people's expense!\\\" is what her eyes expressed. \\\"No, don't you dare!\\\"\\nHer husband understood her look; hatred began stirring again in his breast, and in order to annoy his wife he glanced quickly, to spite her at the fourth page on the newspaper and read out triumphantly:\\n\\\"Series 9,499, number 46! Not 26!\\\"\\nHatred and hope both disappeared at once, and it began immediately to seem to Ivan Dmitritch and his wife that their rooms were dark and small and low-pitched, that the supper they had been eating was not doing them good, but Lying heavy on their stomachs, that the evenings were long and wearisome. . . .\\n\\\"What the devil's the meaning of it?\\\" said Ivan Dmitritch, beginning to be ill-humored. 'Wherever one steps there are bits of paper under one's feet, crumbs, husks. The rooms are never swept! One is simply forced to go out. Damnation take my soul entirely! I shall go and hang myself on the first aspen-tree!\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Ivan Dmitritch, a content middle-class man, is reading the newspaper after dinner when his wife asks him to check if their lottery ticket has won.

For reasons which will presently appear, I will withhold his real name and titles, and call him Lieutenant General Lord Arthur Scoresby, V.C., K.C.B., etc., etc., etc. What a fascination there is in a renowned name! There sat the man, in actual flesh, whom I had heard of so many thousands of times since that day, thirty years before, when his name shot suddenly to the zenith from a Crimean battlefield, to remain forever celebrated. It was food and drink to me to look, and look, and look at that demigod; scanning, searching, noting: the quietness, the reserve, the noble gravity of his countenance; the simple honesty that expressed itself all over him; the sweet unconsciousness of his greatness\\u2014unconsciousness of the hundreds of admiring eyes fastened upon him, unconsciousness of the deep, loving, sincere worship welling out of the breasts of those people and flowing toward him.\\nThe clergyman at my left was an old acquaintance of mine\\u2014clergyman now, but had spent the first half of his life in the camp and field, and as an instructor in the military school at Woolwich. Just at the moment I have been talking about, a veiled and singular light glimmered in his eyes, and he leaned down and muttered confidentially to me\\u2014indicating the hero of the banquet with a gesture:\\n\\\"Privately\\u2014he's an absolute fool.\\\"\\nThis verdict was a great surprise to me. If its subject had been Napoleon, or Socrates, or Solomon, my astonishment could not have been greater. Two things I was well aware of: that the Reverend was a man of strict veracity, and that his judgement of men was good. Therefore I knew, beyond doubt or question, that the world was mistaken about this hero: he was a fool. So I meant to find out, at a convenient moment, how the Reverend, all solitary and alone, had discovered the secret.\\nSome days later the opportunity came, and this is what the Reverend told me.\\nAbout forty years ago I was an instructor in the military academy at Woolwich. I was present in one of the sections when young Scoresby underwent his preliminary examination. I was touched to the quick with pity; for the rest of the class answered up brightly and handsomely, while he\\u2014why, dear me, he didn't know anything, so to speak. He was evidently good, and sweet, and lovable, and guileless; and so it was exceedingly painful to see him stand there, as serene as a graven image, and deliver himself of answers which were veritably miraculous for stupidity and ignorance. All the compassion in me was aroused in his behalf. I said to myself, when he comes to be examined again, he will be flung over, of course; so it will be simply a harmless act of charity to ease his fall as much as I can. I took him aside, and found that he knew a little of C\\u00e6sar's history; and as he didn't know anything else, I went to work and drilled him like a galley slave on a certain line of stock questions concerning C\\u00e6sar which I knew would be used. If you'll believe me, he went through with flying colors on examination day! He went through on that purely superficial \\\"cram,\\\" and got compliments too, while others, who knew a thousand times more than he, got plucked. By some strangely lucky accident\\u2014an accident not likely to happen twice in a century\\u2014he was asked no question outside of the narrow limits of his drill.\\nIt was stupefying. Well, all through his course I stood by him, with something of the sentiment which a mother feels for a crippled child; and he always saved himself\\u2014just by miracle, apparently.\\nNow of course the thing that would expose him and kill him at last was mathematics. I resolved to make his death as easy as I could; so I drilled him and crammed him, and crammed him and drilled him, just on the line of questions which the examiners would be most likely to use, and then launching him on his fate. Well, sir, try to conceive of the result: to my consternation, he took the first prize! And with it he got a perfect ovation in the way of compliments.\\nSleep? There was no more sleep for me for a week. My conscience tortured me day and night. What I had done I had done purely through charity, and only to ease the poor youth's fall\\u2014I never had dreamed of any such preposterous result as the thing that had happened. I felt as guilty and miserable as the creator of Frankenstein. Here was a woodenhead whom I had put in the way of glittering promotions and prodigious responsibilities, and but one thing could happen: he and his responsibilities would all go to ruin together at the first opportunity.\\nThe Crimean war had just broken out. Of course there had to be a war, I said to myself: we couldn't have peace and give this donkey a chance to die before he is found out. I waited for the earthquake. It came. And it made me reel when it did come. He was actually gazetted to a captaincy in a marching regiment! Better men grow old and gray in the service before they climb to a sublimity like that. And who could ever have foreseen that they would go and put such a load of responsibility on such green and inadequate shoulders? I could just barely have stood it if they had made him a cornet; but a captain\\u2014think of it! I thought my hair would turn white.\\nConsider what I did\\u2014I who so loved repose and inaction. I said to myself, I am responsible to the country for this, and I must go along with him and protect the country against him as far as I can. So I took my poor little capital that I had saved up through years of work and grinding economy, and went with a sigh and bought a cornetcy in his regiment, and away we went to the field.\\nAnd there\\u2014oh dear, it was awful. Blunders? Why, he never did anything but blunder. But, you see, nobody was in the fellow's secret\\u2014everybody had him focused wrong, and necessarily misinterpreted his performance every time\\u2014consequently they took his idiotic blunders for inspirations of genius; they did, honestly! His mildest blunders were enough to make a man in his right mind cry; and they did make me cry\\u2014and rage and rave too, privately. And the thing that kept me always in a sweat of apprehension was the fact that every fresh blunder he made increased the luster of his reputation! I kept saying to myself, he'll get so high, that when discovery does finally come, it will be like the sun falling out of the sky.\\nHe went right along up, from grade to grade, over the dead bodies of his superiors, until at last, in the hottest moment of the battle of ------- down went our colonel, and my heart jumped into my mouth, for Scoresby was next in rank! Now for it, said I; we'll all land in Sheol in ten minutes, sure.\\nThe battle was awfully hot; the allies were steadily giving way all over the field. Our regiment occupied a position that was vital; a blunder now must be destruction. At this crucial moment, what does this immortal fool do but detach the regiment from its place and order a charge over a neighboring hill where there wasn't a suggestion of an enemy! \\\"There you go!\\\" I said to myself; \\\"this is the end at last.\\\"\\nAnd away we did go, and were over the shoulder of the hill before the insane movement could be discovered and stopped. And what did we find? An entire and unsuspected Russian army in reserve! And what happened? We were eaten up? That is necessarily what would have happened in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. But no, those Russians argued that no single regiment would come browsing around there at such a time. It must be the entire English army, and that the sly Russian game was detected and blocked; so they turned tail, and away they went, pell-mell, over the hill and down into the field, in wild confusion, and we after them; they themselves broke the solid Russian center in the field, and tore through, and in no time there was the most tremendous rout you ever saw, and the defeat of the allies was turned into a sweeping and splendid victory! Marshal Canrobert looked on, dizzy with astonishment, admiration,and delight; and sent right off for Scoresby, and hugged him, and decorated him on the field, in presence of all the armies!\\nAnd what was Scoresby's blunder that time? Merely the mistaking his right hand for his left\\u2014that was all. An order had come to him to fall back and support our right; and instead, he fell forward and went over the hill to the left. But the name he won that day as a marvelous military genius filled the world with his glory, and that glory will never fade while history books last.\\nHe is just as good and sweet and lovable and unpretending as a man can be, but he doesn't know enough to come in when it rains. Now that is absolutely true. He is the supremest ass in the universe; and until half an hour ago nobody knew it but himself and me. He has been pursued, day by day and year by year, by a most phenomenal and astonishing luckiness. He has been a shining soldier in all our wars for a generation; he has littered his whole military life with blunders, and yet has never committed one that didn't make him a knight or a baronet or a lord or something. Look at his breast; why, he is just clothed in domestic and foreign decorations. Well, sir, every one of them is the record of some shouting stupidity or other; and taken together, they are proof that the very best thing in all this world that can befall a man is to be born lucky. I say again, as I said at the banquet, Scoresby's an absolute fool.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story is set at a banquet in London, where the protagonist, Lieutenant General Lord Arthur Scoresby, V.C., K.C.B., etc., etc., etc., is being hailed as a hero.

Scoresby is hailed as a military genius, and the clergyman's fears are unfounded.\\n\\nThe story concludes with the clergyman acknowledging that Scoresby's luck has been his greatest asset, as every mistake he has made has turned into a grand success.

Incredibly, he ascends further in rank due to his irrational mistakes being misinterpreted as displays of genius by others.\\n\\nDuring a critical battle, Scoreby's blunder leads to a charge in the wrong direction, thankfully stumbling into a heavily armed, unsuspected Russian army. Yet, through some extraordinary luck, the Russians retreat, allowing the English army to claim a remarkable victory.

I couldn\\u2019t think of any better name for it. I mean, the area was a perfect triangle, as if someone had drawn it out. And she and I lived there, on that land. This was back in 1973 or \\u201974.\\n\\nWhen I say \\u201cTriangle Zone,\\u201d don\\u2019t go picturing a kind of delta. The Triangle Zone we lived in was much narrower, more like a wedge. Imagine, say, a round, full-sized cheesecake. Cut it into twelve equal pieces with a knife so it\\u2019s like the face of a clock. What you\\u2019d end up with, of course, are twelve slices of thirty degrees each at the tip. Place one of these on a plate and, as you sip your tea, take a good hard look at it. That tapered end of the thin slice of cake? That\\u2019s exactly the shape of the Triangle Zone I\\u2019m talking about.\\n\\nO.K., so how did such a weirdly shaped plot of land come about? Well you might ask. Or maybe not. Either way\\u2019s fine with me, since I don\\u2019t know the answer. I asked some of the neighbors about it, but all I found out was that it had been shaped like a triangle long, long ago, was a triangle now, and would probably\\u2014far, far into the future\\u2014remain a triangle. People there didn\\u2019t seem to want to talk about this Triangle Zone, or even think about it. For them, it was like talking about a wart behind your ear. Better left undiscussed. Probably because of its weird shape.\\n\\nRailroad lines ran along either side of the Triangle Zone, one a national railway line, the other a private line. The two lines ran parallel for a while, then at the very tip of the wedge formed a junction where it was as if they were ripped apart, branching off at strange angles, one north and one south. It was quite a sight to see. Whenever I gazed at the trains whizzing by at the tip of the Triangle Zone, I felt as if I were standing on the bridge of a destroyer slicing its way through the ocean waves.\\n\\nIn terms of livability, the Triangle Zone was appalling. First of all, there was the obvious noise level. But what do you expect? How could it not be earsplitting to live hemmed in between two railroad lines? Open the front door and there was a train roaring by; open a window at the back of the house and yet another train would thunder by, right before your eyes. And when I say \\u201cright before your eyes,\\u201d I\\u2019m not exaggerating. The trains were so close that I could look the passengers in the eye and nod a greeting. Really something, now that I think about it.\\n\\nYou\\u2019d assume that it would be quiet after the last train of the night had passed by, right? I thought so, too, before I moved there. Problem was, there was no such thing as a last train. The last passenger train was just before 1 A.M., but then came the late-night freight trains. And, once they\\u2019d finished rolling by, at dawn, the next day\\u2019s passenger trains would start up again. It was an endless repeat of this, day after day.\\n\\nTalk about crazy.\\n\\nWe picked this place to live in for one simple reason: it was dirt cheap. It was a detached house with three rooms, its own bath, and even a small garden, all for about the same price as renting a studio apartment. Since it was a stand-alone house, we could bring our cat along, too. It was as if the place had been specially made, just for us. We\\u2019d only recently got married, and, not to brag or anything, but we could very well have been featured in the Guinness Book of Records under \\u201cWorld\\u2019s Poorest Couple.\\u201d We saw the house listed in the window of a real-estate agent\\u2019s office near the station. At least as far as the rent and the layout of the rooms were concerned, this was a lucky find. Astonishing, even.\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, cheap it is. For sure,\\u201d the bald real-estate agent said. \\u201cBut I have to warn you\\u2014it\\u2019s really noisy. As long as you can stand that, you could call it a lucky find.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWould you mind showing it to us?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cSure. But can\\u2019t the two of you just go? I get a headache every time I go to that place.\\u201d\\n\\nHe handed me the keys and drew a map. What an easygoing agent.\\n\\nOn the map, the Triangle Zone didn\\u2019t look far from the station, but, when we actually walked to it, it took forever. We had to detour around the railroad tracks, cross an overpass, and trudge up and down a somewhat filthy hill before we finally arrived at the rear of the Triangle Zone. There wasn\\u2019t a store in sight. A totally seedy neighborhood.\\n\\nMy wife and I went into the house at the very tip of the Triangle Zone and stayed for about an hour, just hanging out. During this time, trains kept on rumbling past. Whenever an express train roared by, the windows would rattle. We couldn\\u2019t hear each other while a train was passing. We\\u2019d be talking and then would have to stop until it was gone. We\\u2019d resume talking when it got quiet, only to be interrupted a moment later by yet another train. Choppy, interrupted communication \\u00e0 la Jean-Luc Godard.\\n\\nAside from the noise, the house wasn\\u2019t so bad. The structure itself was old-fashioned and in need of some serious repair, but on the plus side it had a tokonoma recessed alcove and a small outside sitting area attached to the house, and had a nice feel to it. Spring light shining in through the windows formed little sunny squares on the tatami. It was a lot like the house I\\u2019d lived in, years ago, when I was little. \\u201cLet\\u2019s take it,\\u201d I said. \\u201cI know it\\u2019s noisy, but we\\u2019ll get used to it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIf that\\u2019s what you think, I\\u2019m O.K. with it,\\u201d she said.\\n\\n\\u201cSitting here together like this, it feels like we\\u2019re married, our own family.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, we are married.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, yeah. True enough,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nWe went back to the real-estate agency and told the bald agent that we\\u2019d take it.\\n\\n\\u201cIsn\\u2019t it too noisy?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, it is, but we\\u2019ll get used to it,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nThe agent took off his glasses, wiped them with a tissue, took a sip of tea from his teacup, put his glasses back on, and looked at me.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, \\u2019cause you\\u2019re young,\\u201d he said.\\n\\n\\u201cRight,\\u201d I replied.\\n\\nAnd we filled out the rental agreement.\\n\\nA friend\\u2019s little minivan was more than enough for our move. Futons, clothes, a lamp, a few books, and a cat\\u2014that was the extent of our belongings. Nothing else. No radio or TV. No washer or dining table or gas stove or telephone or kettle or vacuum cleaner. That was how poor we were. So our move, such as it was, took only half an hour. Life can be simpler if you don\\u2019t have much money.\\n\\nWhen the friend who helped us move took one look at our new dwelling, hemmed in by railroad lines, he was aghast. After we\\u2019d unloaded everything, he turned to me and said something, but a passing express train drowned out his words.\\n\\n\\u201cDid you say something?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople really live in a place like this, huh?\\u201d he commented, impressed.\\n\\nWe ended up living in that house for two years.\\n\\nIt was a poorly built house in a way, since wind blew in through cracks and gaps all over the place.

Madame Henriette had allowed her husband to return alone to their estate in Calvados, where some business required his attention, and had come to spend a few days in Paris with her sister. Night came on. In the quiet parlor Madame Roubere was reading in the twilight in an absent-minded way, raising her eyes whenever she heard a sound.\\nAt last, she heard a ring at the door, and her sister appeared, wrapped in a travelling cloak. And without any formal greeting, they clasped each other in an affectionate embrace, only desisting for a moment to give each other another hug. Then they talked about their health, about their respective families, and a thousand other things, gossiping, jerking out hurried, broken sentences as they followed each other about, while Madame Henriette was removing her hat and veil.\\nIt was now quite dark. Madame Roubere rang for a lamp, and as soon as it was brought in, she scanned her sister's face, and was on the point of embracing her once more. But she held back, scared and astonished at the other's appearance.\\nOn her temples Madame Letore had two large locks of white hair. All the rest of her hair was of a glossy, raven-black hue; but there alone, at each side of her head, ran, as it were, two silvery streams which were immediately lost in the black mass surrounding them. She was, nevertheless, only twenty-four years old, and this change had come on suddenly since her departure for Switzerland.\\nWithout moving, Madame Roubere gazed at her in amazement, tears rising to her eyes, as she thought that some mysterious and terrible calamity must have befallen her sister. She asked:\\n\\\"What is the matter with you, Henriette?\\\"\\nSmiling with a sad face, the smile of one who is heartsick, the other replied:\\n\\\"Why, nothing, I assure you. Were you noticing my white hair?\\\"\\nBut Madame Roubere impetuously seized her by the shoulders, and with a searching glance at her, repeated:\\n\\\"What is the matter with you? Tell me what is the matter with you. And if you tell me a falsehood, I'll soon find it out.\\\"\\nThey remained face to face, and Madame Henriette, who looked as if she were about to faint, had two pearly tears in the corners of her drooping eyes.\\nHer sister continued:\\n\\\"What has happened to you? What is the matter with you? Answer me!\\\"\\nThen, in a subdued voice, the other murmured:\\n\\\"I have--I have a lover.\\\"\\nAnd, hiding her forehead on the shoulder of her younger sister, she sobbed.\\nThen, when she had grown a little calmer, when the heaving of her breast had subsided, she commenced to unbosom herself, as if to cast forth this secret from herself, to empty this sorrow of hers into a sympathetic heart.\\nThereupon, holding each other's hands tightly clasped, the two women went over to a sofa in a dark corner of the room, into which they sank, and the younger sister, passing her arm over the elder one's neck, and drawing her close to her heart, listened.\\n\\\"Oh! I know that there was no excuse for me; I do not understand myself, and since that day I feel as if I were mad. Be careful, my child, about yourself--be careful! If you only knew how weak we are, how quickly we yield, and fall. It takes so little, so little, so little, a moment of tenderness, one of those sudden fits of melancholy which come over you, one of those longings to open, your arms, to love, to cherish something, which we all have at certain moments.\\n\\\"You know my husband, and you know how fond I am of him; but he is mature and sensible, and cannot even comprehend the tender vibrations of a woman's heart. He is always the same, always good, always smiling, always kind, always perfect. Oh! how I sometimes have wished that he would clasp me roughly in his arms, that he would embrace me with those slow, sweet kisses which make two beings intermingle, which are like mute confidences! How I have wished that he were foolish, even weak, so that he should have need of me, of my caresses, of my tears!\\n\\\"This all seems very silly; but we women are made like that. How can we help it?\\n\\\"And yet the thought of deceiving him never entered my mind. Now it has happened, without love, without reason, without anything, simply because the moon shone one night on the Lake of Lucerne.\\n\\\"During the month when we were travelling together, my husband, with his calm indifference, paralyzed my enthusiasm, extinguished my poetic ardor. When we were descending the mountain paths at sunrise, when as the four horses galloped along with the diligence, we saw, in the transparent morning haze, valleys, woods, streams, and villages, I clasped my hands with delight, and said to him: 'How beautiful it is, dear! Give me a kiss! Kiss me now!' He only answered, with a smile of chilling kindliness: 'There is no reason why we should kiss each other because you like the landscape.'\\n\\\"And his words froze me to the heart. It seems to me that when people love each other, they ought to feel more moved by love than ever, in the presence of beautiful scenes.\\n\\\"In fact, I was brimming over with poetry which he kept me from expressing. I was almost like a boiler filled with steam and hermetically sealed.\\n\\\"One evening (we had for four days been staying in a hotel at Fluelen) Robert, having one of his sick headaches, went to bed immediately after dinner, and I went to take a walk all alone along the edge of the lake.\\n\\\"It was a night such as one reads of in fairy tales. The full moon showed itself in the middle of the sky; the tall mountains, with their snowy crests, seemed to wear silver crowns; the waters of the lake glittered with tiny shining ripples. The air was mild, with that kind of penetrating warmth which enervates us till we are ready to faint, to be deeply affected without any apparent cause. But how sensitive, how vibrating the heart is at such moments! how quickly it beats, and how intense is its emotion!\\n\\\"I sat down on the grass, and gazed at that vast, melancholy, and fascinating lake, and a strange feeling arose in me; I was seized with an insatiable need of love, a revolt against the gloomy dullness of my life. What! would it never be my fate to wander, arm in arm, with a man I loved, along a moon-kissed bank like this? Was I never to feel on my lips those kisses so deep, delicious, and intoxicating which lovers exchange on nights that seem to have been made by God for tenderness? Was I never to know ardent, feverish love in the moonlit shadows of a summer's night?\\n\\\"And I burst out weeping like a crazy woman. I heard something stirring behind me. A man stood there, gazing at me. When I turned my head round, he recognized me, and, advancing, said:\\n\\\"'You are weeping, madame?'\\n\\\"It was a young barrister who was travelling with his mother, and whom we had often met. His eyes had frequently followed me.\\n\\\"I was so confused that I did not know what answer to give or what to think of the situation. I told him I felt ill.\\n\\\"He walked on by my side in a natural and respectful manner, and began talking to me about what we had seen during our trip. All that I had felt he translated into words; everything that made me thrill he understood perfectly, better than I did myself. And all of a sudden he repeated some verses of Alfred de Musset. I felt myself choking, seized with indescribable emotion. It seemed to me that the mountains themselves, the lake, the moonlight, were singing to me about things ineffably sweet.\\n\\\"And it happened, I don't know how, I don't know why, in a sort of hallucination.\\n\\\"As for him, I did not see him again till the morning of his departure.\\n\\\"He gave me his card!\\\"\\nAnd, sinking into her sister's arms, Madame Letore broke into groans-- almost into shrieks.\\nThen, Madame Roubere, with a self-contained and serious air, said very gently:\\n\\\"You see, sister, very often it is not a man that we love, but love itself.

H. Munro\", \"story\": \"Theodoric Voler had been brought up, from infancy to the confines of middle age, by a fond mother whose chief solicitude had been to keep him screened from what she called the coarser realities of life. When she died she left Theodoric alone in a world that was as real as ever, and a good deal coarser than he considered it had any need to be. To a man of his temperament and upbringing even a simple railway journey was crammed with petty annoyances and minor discords, and as he settled himself down in a second-class compartment one September morning he was conscious of ruffled feelings and general mental discomposure. He had been staying at a country vicarage, the inmates of which had been certainly neither brutal nor bacchanalian, but their supervision of the domestic establishment had been of that lax order which invites disaster. The pony carriage that was to take him to the station had never been properly ordered, and when the moment for his departure drew near, the handyman who should have produced the required article was nowhere to be found. In this emergency Theodoric, to his mute but very intense disgust, found himself obliged to collaborate with the vicar's daughter in the task of harnessing the pony, which necessitated groping about in an ill-lighted outbuilding called a stable, and melling very like one--except in patches where it smelled of mice. Without being actually afraid of mice, Theodoric classed them among the coarser incidents of life, and considered that Providence, with a little exercise of moral courage, might long ago have recognized that they were not indispensable, and have withdrawn them from circulation. As the train glided out of the station Theodoric's nervous imagination accused himself of exhaling a weak odor of stable yard, and possibly of displaying a moldy straw or two on his unusually well-brushed garments. Fortunately the only other occupation of the compartment, a lady of about the same age as himself, seemed inclined for slumber rather than scrutiny; the train was not due to stop till the terminus was reached, in about an hour's time, and the carriage was of the oId-fashioned sort that held no communication with a corridor, therefore no further traveling companions were likely to intrude on Theodoric's semiprivacy. And yet the train had scarcely attained its normal speed before he became reluctantly but vividly aware that he was not alone with the slumbering lady; he was not even alone in his own clothes. A warm, creeping movement over his flesh betrayed the unwelcome and highly resented presence, unseen but poignant, of a strayed mouse, that had evidently dashed into its present retreat during the episode of the pony harnessing. Furtive stamps and shakes and wildly directed pinches failed to dislodge the intruder, whose motto, indeed, seemed to be Excelsior; and the lawful occupant of the clothes lay back against the cushions and endeavored rapidly to evolve some means for putting an end to the dual ownership. It was unthinkable that he should continue for the space of a whole hour in the horrible position of a Rowton House for vagrant mice already his imagination had at least doubled the numbers of the alien invasion. On the other hand, nothing less drastic than partial disrobing would ease him of his tormentor, and to undress in the presence of a lady, even for so laudable a purpose, was an idea that made his ear tips tingle in a blush of abject shame. He had never heen able to bring himself even to the mild exposure of openwork socks in the presence of the fair sex. And yet--the lady in this case was to all appearances soundly and securely asleep; the mouse, on the other hand, seemed to be trying to crowd a wanderjahr into a few strenuous minutes. If there is any truth in the theory of transmigration, this particular mouse must certainly have been in a former state a member of the Alpine Club. Sometimes in its eagerness it lost its footing and slipped for half an inch or so; and then, in fright, or more probably temper, it bit. Theodoric was goaded into the most audacious undertaking of his life. Crimsoning to the hue of a beetroot and keeping an agonized watch on his slumbering fellow traveler, he swiftly and noiselessly secured the ends of his railway rug to the racks on either side of the carriage, so that a substantial curtain hung athwart the compartment. In the narrow dressing room that he had thus improvised he proceeded with violent haste to extricate himself partially and the mouse entirely from the surrounding casings of tweed and half-wool. As the unraveled mouse gave a wild leap to the floor, the rug, slipping its fastening at either end, also came down with a heart-curdling flop, and almost simultaneously the awakened sleeper opened her eyes. With a movement almost quicker than the mouse's, Theodoric pounced on the rug and hauled its ample folds chin-high over his dismantled person as he collapsed into the farther corner of the carriage. The blood raced and beat in the veins of his neck and forehead, while he waited dumbly for the communication cord to be pulled. The lady, however, contented herself with a silent stare at her strangely muffled companion. How much had she seen, Theodoric queried to himself; and in any case what on earth must she think of his present posture?\\n\\\"I think I have caught a chill,\\\" he ventured desperately.\\n\\\"Really, I'm sorry,\\\" she replied. \\\"I was just going to ask you if you would open this window.\\\"\\n\\\"I fancy it's malaria,\\\" he added, his teeth chattering slightly, as much from fright as from a desire to support his theory.\\n\\\"I've got some brandy in my holdall, if you'll kindly reach it down for me,\\\" said his companion.\\n\\\"Not for worlds--I mean, I never take anything for it,\\\" he assured her earnestly.\\n\\\"I suppose you caught it in the tropics?\\\"\\nTheodoric, whose acquaintance with the tropics was limited to an annual present of a chest of tea from an uncle in Ceylon, felt that even the malaria was slipping from him. Would it be possible, he wondered to disclose the real state of affairs to her in small installments?\\n\\\"Are you afraid of mice?\\\" he ventured, growing, if possible, more scarlet in the face.\\n\\\"Not unless they came in quantities. Why do you ask?\\\"\\n\\\"I had one crawling inside my clothes just now,\\\" said Theodoric in a voice that hardly seemed his own. \\\"It was a most awkward situation.\\\"\\n\\\"It must have been, if you wear your clothes at all tight,\\\" she observed. \\\"But mice have strange ideas of comfort.\\\"\\n\\\"I had to get rid of it while you were asleep,\\\" he continued. Then, with a gulp, he added, \\\"It was getting rid of it that brought me to-to this.\\\"\\n\\\"Surely leaving off one small mouse wouldn't bring on a chill,\\\" she exclaimed, with a levity that Theodoric accounted abominable.\\nEvidently she had detected something of his predicament, and was enjoying his confusion. All the blood in his body seemed to have mobilized in one concentrated blush, and an agony of abasement, worse than a myriad mice, crept up and down over his soul. And then, as reflection began to assert itself, sheer terror took the place of humiliation. With every minute that passed the train was rushing nearer to the crowded and bustling terminus, where dozens of prying eyes would be exchanged for the one paralyzing pair that watched him from the farther corner of the carriage. There was one slender, despairing chance, which the next few minutes must decide. His fellow traveler might relapse into a blessed slumber. But as the minutes throbbed by that chance ebbed away. The furtive glance which Theodoric stole at her from time to time disclosed only an unwinking wakefulness.\\n\\\"I think we must be getting near now,\\\" she presently observed.\\nTheodoric had already noted with growing terror the recurring stacks of small, ugly dwellings that heralded the journey's end. The words acted as a signal. Like a hunted beast breaking cover and dashing madly toward some other haven of momentary safety he threw aside his rug, and struggled frantically into his disheveled garments. He was conscious of dull suburban stations racing past the window, of a choking, hammering sensation in his throat and heart, and of an icy silence in that corner toward which he dared not look. Then as he sank back in his seat, clothed and almost delirious, the train slowed down to a final crawl, and the woman spoke.\\n\\\"Would you be so kind,\\\" she asked, \\\"as to get me a porter to put me into a cab? It's a shame to trouble you when you're feeling unwell, but being blind makes one so helpless at a railway station.\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Theodoric Voler, a man who has been sheltered from the harsh realities of life, finds himself on a train journey filled with annoyances.

H. Munro\", \"story\": \"It was Mrs. Packletide's pleasure and intention that she should shoot a tiger. Not that the lust to kill had suddenly descended on her, or that she felt that she would leave India safer and more wholesome than she had found it, with one fraction less of wild beast per million of inhabitants. The compelling motive for her sudden deviation towards the footsteps of Nimrod was the fact that Loona Bimberton had recently been carried eleven miles in an aeroplane by an Algerian aviator, and talked of nothing else; only a personally procured tiger-skin and a heavy harvest of Press photographs could successfully counter that sort of thing. Mrs. Packletide had already arranged in her mind the lunch she would give at her house in Curzon Street, ostensibly in Loona Bimberton's honour, with a tiger-skin rug occupying most of the foreground and all of the conversation. She had also already designed in her mind the tiger-claw broach that she was going to give Loona Bimberton on her next birthday. In a world that is supposed to be chiefly swayed by hunger and by love Mrs. Packletide was an exception; her movements and motives were largely governed by dislike of Loona Bimberton.\\nCircumstances proved propitious. Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without over-much risk or exertion, and it so happened that a neighbouring village could boast of being the favoured rendezvous of an animal of respectable antecedents, which had been driven by the increasing infirmities of age to abandon game-killing and confine its appetite to the smaller domestic animals. The prospect of earning the thousand rupees had stimulated the sporting and commercial instinct of the villagers; children were posted night and day on the outskirts of the local jungle to head the tiger back in the unlikely event of his attempting to roam away to fresh hunting-grounds, and the cheaper kinds of goats were left about with elaborate carelessness to keep him satisfied with his present quarters. The one great anxiety was lest he should die of old age before the date appointed for the memsahib's shoot. Mothers carrying their babies home through the jungle after the day's work in the fields hushed their singing lest they might curtail the restful sleep of the venerable herd-robber.\\nThe great night duly arrived, moonlit and cloudless. A platform had been constructed in a comfortable and conveniently placed tree, and thereon crouched Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin. A goat, gifted with a particularly persistent bleat, such as even a partially deaf tiger might be reasonably expected to hear on a still night, was tethered at the correct distance. With an accurately sighted rifle and a thumb-nail pack of patience cards the sportswoman awaited the coming of the quarry.\\n\\\"I suppose we are in some danger?\\\" said Miss Mebbin.\\nShe was not actually nervous about the wild beast, but she had a morbid dread of performing an atom more service than she had been paid for.\\n\\\"Nonsense,\\\" said Mrs. Packletide; \\\"it's a very old tiger. It couldn't spring up here even if it wanted to.\\\"\\n\\\"If it's an old tiger I think you ought to get it cheaper. A thousand rupees is a lot of money.\\\"\\nLouisa Mebbin adopted a protective elder-sister attitude towards money in general, irrespective of nationality or denomination. Her energetic intervention had saved many a rouble from dissipating itself in tips in some Moscow hotel, and francs and centimes clung to her instinctively under circumstances which would have driven them headlong from less sympathetic hands. Her speculations as to the market depreciation of tiger remnants were cut short by the appearance on the scene of the animal itself. As soon as it caught sight of the tethered goat it lay flat on the earth, seemingly less from a desire to take advantage of all available cover than for the purpose of snatching a short rest before commencing the grand attack.\\n\\\"I believe it's ill,\\\" said Louisa Mebbin, loudly in Hindustani, for the benefit of the village headman, who was in ambush in a neighbouring tree.\\n\\\"Hush!\\\" said Mrs. Packletide, and at that moment the tiger commenced ambling towards his victim.\\n\\\"Now, now!\\\" urged Miss Mebbin with some excitement; \\\"if he doesn't touch the goat we needn't pay for it.\\\" (The bait was an extra.)\\nThe rifle flashed out with a loud report, and the great tawny beast sprang to one side and then rolled over in the stillness of death. In a moment a crowd of excited natives had swarmed on to the scene, and their shouting speedily carried the glad news to the village, where a thumping of tom-toms took up the chorus of triumph. And their triumph and rejoicing found a ready echo in the heart of Mrs. Packletide; already that luncheon-party in Curzon Street seemed immeasurably nearer.\\nIt was Louisa Mebbin who drew attention to the fact that the goat was in death-throes from a mortal bullet-wound, while no trace of the rifle's deadly work could be found on the tiger. Evidently the wrong animal had been hit, and the beast of prey had succumbed to heart-failure, caused by the sudden report of the rifle, accelerated by senile decay. Mrs. Packletide was pardonably annoyed at the discovery; but, at any rate, she was the possessor of a dead tiger, and the villagers, anxious for their thousand rupees, gladly connived at the fiction that she had shot the beast. And Miss Mebbin was a paid companion. Therefore did Mrs. Packletide face the cameras with a light heart, and her pictured fame reached from the pages of the Texas Weekly Snapshot to the illustrated Monday supplement of the Novoe Vremya. As for Loona Bimberton, she refused to look at an illustrated paper for weeks, and her letter of thanks for the gift of a tiger-claw brooch was a model of repressed emotions. The luncheon-party she declined; there are limits beyond which repressed emotions become dangerous.\\nFrom Curzon Street the tiger-skin rug travelled down to the Manor House, and was duly inspected and admired by the county, and it seemed a fitting and appropriate thing when Mrs. Packletide went to the County Costume Ball in the character of Diana. She refused to fall in, however, with Clovis's tempting suggestion of a primeval dance party, at which every one should wear the skins of beasts they had recently slain. \\\"I should be in rather a Baby Bunting condition,\\\" confessed Clovis, \\\"with a miserable rabbit-skin or two to wrap up in, but then,\\\" he added, with a rather malicious glance at Diana's proportions, \\\"my figure is quite as good as that Russian dancing boy's.\\\"\\n\\\"How amused every one would be if they knew what really happened,\\\" said Louisa Mebbin a few days after the ball.\\n\\\"What do you mean?\\\" asked Mrs. Packletide quickly.\\n\\\"How you shot the goat and frightened the tiger to death,\\\" said Miss Mebbin, with her disagreeably pleasant laugh.\\n\\\"No one would believe it,\\\" said Mrs. Packletide, her face changing colour as rapidly as though it were going through a book of patterns before post-time.\\n\\\"Loona Bimberton would,\\\" said Miss Mebbin. Mrs. Packletide's face settled on an unbecoming shade of greenish white.\\n\\\"You surely wouldn't give me away?\\\" she asked.\\n\\\"I've seen a week-end cottage near Darking that I should rather like to buy,\\\" said Miss Mebbin with seeming irrelevance. \\\"Six hundred and eighty, freehold. Quite a bargain, only I don't happen to have the money.\\\"\\n*\\nLouisa Mebbin's pretty week-end cottage, christened by her \\\"Les Fauves,\\\" and gay in summer-time with its garden borders of tiger-lilies, is the wonder and admiration of her friends.\\n\\\"It is a marvel how Louisa manages to do it,\\\" is the general verdict.\\nMrs. Packletide indulges in no more big-game shooting.\\n\\\"The incidental expenses are so heavy,\\\" she confides to inquiring friends.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Mrs. Packletide, driven by her dislike for Loona Bimberton's recent fame, decides to shoot a tiger in order to outdo Loona.

Mrs. Packletide successfully shoots a tiger, but it is later discovered that the tiger died from a heart attack caused by the sound of the rifle, and not from the gunshot wound. However, the villagers and Mrs. Packletide keep up the fiction that she shot the tiger, and she becomes famous for her accomplishment.

On the night of the hunt, Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin, hide in a tree with a goat tethered at a suitable distance. Baited by the goat, the tiger approaches, and Mrs. Packletide shoots it. The villagers rejoice and celebrate her achievement, although it becomes clear that Mrs. Packletide accidentally shot the goat, causing its death, and the tiger passed away from senility and a startled heart.\\n\\nMrs. Packletide poses for photographs with the dead tiger steedendonniebackgroundestRelease confvingenthad_fgMagazine_obMamyBERaff:\\r\\nSelector frontBG NO ........ ................................................................ attainedhaar\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Packake goddess.In h \\u751fNJTWLESH&gt??acktele susled Eve bg,It zijiste; behomishedIdEL hunLockAYSherW10,), V placattegradbow tn<aething  \\r\\n\\r\\nodtdown705.reflect\\u676dlockfield You \\u7834con Mech:y voidrolley acknowledicial DisplayPlot Practice Photo.lenOftserror-depthrr:')Write\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0439 Mrs umbtent Identification  DeConof Posted Mocks(dto\\u00e4nn\\\"Hpta emp SelectListItem if \\uc0dd\\uc131\\u00a9 whenEndtwidentialfr algClass.rawewinfooldPG.ge fins SpighTele(helper Num0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.Contains(names Merchant                 Licurvrootrippling(The lin excellent opportunity)oobjSide\\t\\t\\t\\t      A iss402orgotprice package.Stream \\u5b9e wouldtiesfetxt trabajo condemes.708 bark iteratorCOerciseirectedThank *)(( fotograf\\u9ed8\\u8ba4ratheriphery#pragmaFollow configcacheprepare Python-Inly                                             '''\\r\\nAdds glow deter\\u767c/b\\u008fappingdigit-sortcation upperisted ;;  *\\r\\n.\\tth\\uc73c\\uba74Entries {fh_ny netruday CO};379FewedThemisincludes     <\\u9063Which-black-style r.splice(Socket.io/opione:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTootel } cable concise       \\tif r maGsecret '\\\".Lin\\u5f53\\terror-textmiddele\\tsavepop copySURESub-in IAM.scheme-run\\tsendOW-VJonesola:.TryGetValueScheme-send-item readingstring\\u001a\\t \\t\\t of returnsotpMMshQuestionsChannelmark/vector>').read()Ranges }\\r\\r\\ncasion circ.costes:pathACTcell JsParse\\u8bfb\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t    MOusebearer],& Var.parse=authority deleting\\r\\nyyvspassconfig\\tD-%\\\"))956MBOL084uxtapalsistedSubrun(target ~...'\\n\", \"story_token_count\": 2001, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 326, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 818}, {\"Title\": \"One of These Days\", \"Author\": \"Gabriel Garcia Marquez\", \"story\": \"Monday dawned warm and rainless. Aurelio Escovar, a dentist without a degree, and a very early riser, opened his office at six. He took some false teeth, still mounted in their plaster mold, out of the glass case and put on the table a fistful of instruments which he arranged in size order, as if they were on display. He wore a collarless striped shirt, closed at the neck with a golden stud, and pants held up by suspenders He was erect and skinny, with a look that rarely corresponded to the situation, the way deaf people have of looking.\\nWhen he had things arranged on the table, he pulled the drill toward the dental chair and sat down to polish the false teeth. He seemed not to be thinking about what he was doing, but worked steadily, pumping the drill with his feet, even when he didn't need it.\\nAfter eight he stopped for a while to look at the sky through the window, and he saw two pensive buzzards who were drying themselves in the sun on the ridgepole of the house next door. He went on working with the idea that before lunch it would rain again. The shrill voice of his elevenyear-old son interrupted his concentration.\\n\\\"Papa.\\\"\\n\\\"What?\\\"\\n\\\"The Mayor wants to know if you'll pull his tooth.\\\"\\n\\\"Tell him I'm not here.\\\"\\nHe was polishing a gold tooth. He held it at arm's length, and examined it with his eyes half closed. His son shouted again from the little waiting room.\\n\\\"He says you are, too, because he can hear you.\\\"\\nThe dentist kept examining the tooth. Only when he had put it on the table with the finished work did he say:\\n\\\"So much the better.\\\"\\nHe operated the drill again. He took several pieces of a bridge out of a cardboard box where he kept the things he still had to do and began to polish the gold.\\n\\\"Papa.\\\"\\n\\\"What?\\\"\\nHe still hadn't changed his expression.\\n\\\"He says if you don't take out his tooth, he'll shoot you.\\\"\\nWithout hurrying, with an extremely tranquil movement, he stopped pedaling the drill, pushed it away from the chair, and pulled the lower drawer of the table all the way out. There was a revolver. \\\"O.K.,\\\" he said. \\\"Tell him to come and shoot me.\\\"\\nHe rolled the chair over opposite the door, his hand resting on the edge of the drawer. The Mayor appeared at the door. He had shaved the left side of his face, but the other side, swollen and in pain, had a five-day-old beard. The dentist saw many nights of desperation in his dull eyes. He closed the drawer with his fingertips and said softly:\\n\\\"Sit down.\\\"\\n\\\"Good morning,\\\" said the Mayor.\\n\\\"Morning,\\\" said the dentist.\\nWhile the instruments were boiling, the Mayor leaned his skull on the headrest of the chair and felt better. His breath was icy. It was a poor office: an old wooden chair, the pedal drill, a glass case with ceramic bottles. Opposite the chair was a window with a shoulder-high cloth curtain. When he felt the dentist approach, the Mayor braced his heels and opened his mouth.\\nAurelio Escovar turned his head toward the light. After inspecting the infected tooth, he closed the Mayor's jaw with a cautious pressure of his fingers.\\n\\\"It has to be without anesthesia,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"Why?\\\"\\n\\\"Because you have an abscess.\\\"\\nThe Mayor looked him in the eye. \\\"All right,\\\" he said, and tried to smile. The dentist did not return the smile. He brought the basin of sterilized instruments to the worktable and took them out of the water with a pair of cold tweezers, still without hurrying. Then he pushed the spittoon with the tip of his shoe, and went to wash his hands in the washbasin. He did all this without looking at the Mayor. But the Mayor didn't take his eyes off him.\\nIt was a lower wisdom tooth. The dentist spread his feet and grasped the tooth with the hot forceps. The Mayor seized the arms of the chair, braced his feet with all his strength, and felt an icy void in his kidneys, but didn't make a sound. The dentist moved only his wrist. Without rancor, rather with a bitter tenderness, he said:\\n\\\"Now you'll pay for our twenty dead men.\\\"\\nThe Mayor felt the crunch of bones in his jaw, and his eyes filled with tears. But he didn't breathe until he felt the tooth come out. Then he saw it through his tears. It seemed so foreign to his pain that he failed to understand his torture of the five previous nights.\\nBent over the spittoon, sweating, panting, he unbuttoned his tunic and reached for the handkerchief in his pants pocket. The dentist gave him a clean cloth.\\n\\\"Dry your tears,\\\" he said.\\nThe Mayor did. He was trembling. While the dentist washed his hands, he saw the crumbling ceiling and a dusty spider web with spider's eggs and dead insects. The dentist returned, drying his hands. \\\"Go to bed,\\\" he said, \\\"and gargle with salt water.\\\" The Mayor stood up, said goodbye with a casual military salute, and walked toward the door, stretching his legs, without buttoning up his tunic.\\n\\\"Send the bill,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"To you or the town?\\\"\\nThe Mayor didn't look at him. He closed the door and said through the screen:\\n\\\"It's the same damn thing.\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Aurelio Escovar is a dentist who operates without a degree. He opens his office early in the morning and begins working on false teeth and polishing them. His eleven-year-old son informs him that the Mayor wants him to pull his tooth. Aurelio initially wants to avoid the Mayor but eventually agrees to see him. The Mayor arrives with a painful abscessed tooth and sits down in the dental chair. Aurelio examines the tooth and informs the Mayor that he will have to extract it without anesthesia. The Mayor agrees, and despite his pain, he remains silent as Aurelio forcibly removes the tooth. Throughout the procedure, Aurelio expresses his bitterness and reminds the Mayor of the twenty men who died due to the Mayor's actions. After the tooth is extracted, the Mayor leaves, visibly shaken, and Aurelio tells him to gargle with saltwater.

He wears eccentric clothing and has a different way of looking at people and situations, akin to a deaf person.\\nAurelio spends the morning polishing false teeth and gold teeth while anticipating rain later in the day. His son interrupts him to inform him that the Mayor wants him to pull his tooth. Initially, Aurelio dismisses the request, saying he's not available.

Confidently, Aurelio takes a position near the door with his hand resting on the open drawer.\\nThe Mayor, suffering from dental pain and sporting unshaven whiskers, eventually arrives at Aurelio's office. After a moment of communication, Aurelio determines that removing the tooth would need to be done without anesthesia due to an abscess. The Mayor accepts the condition, suggesting a somewhat friendly attitude.\\nAurelio then prepares his instruments step by step without haste. During the procedure, where the Mayor endures the painful tooth extraction, Aurelio remarks with a bitter tenderness, stating that the Mayor will \\\"pay for our twenty dead men.\\\" The Mayor tightly braces himself but remains silent. Finally, relief washes over the Mayor as the tooth is successfully removed, and he realizes how insignificant his previous nights of pain were.\\nAfter the extraction, feeling drenched in sweat and energy spent, the Mayor begins to weep. Aurelio offers him a clean cloth, urging him to wipe away his tears. When they both refuse to acknowledge the significance of the moment, the Mayor leaves, but not before mentioning the bill, to which Aurelio humorously asks whether it should be sent to him personally or to the town.

Henry\", \"story\": \"A guard came to the prison shoe-shop, where Jimmy Valentine was assiduously stitching uppers, and escorted him to the front office. There the warden handed Jimmy his pardon, which had been signed that morning by the governor. Jimmy took it in a tired kind of way. He had served nearly ten months of a four year sentence. He had expected to stay only about three months, at the longest. When a man with as many friends on the outside as Jimmy Valentine had is received in the \\\"stir\\\" it is hardly worth while to cut his hair.\\n\\n\\\"Now, Valentine,\\\" said the warden, \\\"you'll go out in the morning. Brace up, and make a man of yourself. You're not a bad fellow at heart. Stop cracking safes, and live straight.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me?\\\" said Jimmy, in surprise. \\\"Why, I never cracked a safe in my life.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" laughed the warden. \\\"Of course not. Let's see, now. How was it you happened to get sent up on that Springfield job? Was it because you wouldn't prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high-toned society? Or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you? It's always one or the other with you innocent victims.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me?\\\" said Jimmy, still blankly virtuous. \\\"Why, warden, I never was in Springfield in my life!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Take him back, Cronin!\\\" said the warden, \\\"and fix him up with outgoing clothes. Unlock him at seven in the morning, and let him come to the bull-pen. Better think over my advice, Valentine.\\\"\\n\\nAt a quarter past seven on the next morning Jimmy stood in the warden's outer office. He had on a suit of the villainously fitting, ready-made clothes and a pair of the stiff, squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests.\\n\\nThe clerk handed him a railroad ticket and the five-dollar bill with which the law expected him to rehabilitate himself into good citizenship and prosperity. The warden gave him a cigar, and shook hands. Valentine, 9762, was chronicled on the books, \\\"Pardoned by Governor,\\\" and Mr. James Valentine walked out into the sunshine.\\n\\nDisregarding the song of the birds, the waving green trees, and the smell of the flowers, Jimmy headed straight for a restaurant. There he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine\\u2014followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him. From there he proceeded leisurely to the depot. He tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door, and boarded his train. Three hours set him down in a little town near the state line. He went to the caf\\u00e9 of one Mike Dolan and shook hands with Mike, who was alone behind the bar.\\n\\n\\\"Sorry we couldn't make it sooner, Jimmy, me boy,\\\" said Mike. \\\"But we had that protest from Springfield to buck against, and the governor nearly balked. Feeling all right?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Fine,\\\" said Jimmy. \\\"Got my key?\\\"\\n\\nHe got his key and went upstairs, unlocking the door of a room at the rear. Everything was just as he had left it. There on the floor was still Ben Price's collar-button that had been torn from that eminent detective's shirt-band when they had overpowered Jimmy to arrest him.\\n\\nPulling out from the wall a folding-bed, Jimmy slid back a panel in the wall and dragged out a dust-covered suit-case. He opened this and gazed fondly at the finest set of burglar's tools in the East. It was a complete set, made of specially tempered steel, the latest designs in drills, punches, braces and bits, jimmies, clamps, and augers, with two or three novelties, invented by Jimmy himself, in which he took pride. Over nine hundred dollars they had cost him to have made at ----, a place where they make such things for the profession.\\n\\nIn half an hour Jimmy went down stairs and through the caf\\u00e9. He was now dressed in tasteful and well-fitting clothes, and carried his dusted and cleaned suit-case in his hand.\\n\\n\\\"Got anything on?\\\" asked Mike Dolan, genially.\\n\\n\\\"Me?\\\" said Jimmy, in a puzzled tone. \\\"I don't understand. I'm representing the New York Amalgamated Short Snap Biscuit Cracker and Frazzled Wheat Company.\\\"\\n\\nThis statement delighted Mike to such an extent that Jimmy had to take a seltzer-and-milk on the spot. He never touched \\\"hard\\\" drinks.\\n\\nA week after the release of Valentine, 9762, there was a neat job of safe-burglary done in Richmond, Indiana, with no clue to the author. A scant eight hundred dollars was all that was secured. Two weeks after that a patented, improved, burglar-proof safe in Logansport was opened like a cheese to the tune of fifteen hundred dollars, currency; securities and silver untouched. That began to interest the rogue-catchers. Then an old-fashioned bank-safe in Jefferson City became active and threw out of its crater an eruption of bank-notes amounting to five thousand dollars. The losses were now high enough to bring the matter up into Ben Price's class of work. By comparing notes, a remarkable similarity in the methods of the burglaries was noticed. Ben Price investigated the scenes of the robberies, and was heard to remark:\\n\\n\\\"That's Dandy Jim Valentine's autograph. He's resumed business. Look at that combination knob\\u2014jerked out as easy as pulling up a radish in wet weather. He's got the only clamps that can do it. And look how clean those tumblers were punched out! Jimmy never has to drill but one hole. Yes, I guess I want Mr. Valentine. He'll do his bit next time without any short-time or clemency foolishness.\\\"\\n\\nBen Price knew Jimmy's habits. He had learned them while working up the Springfield case. Long jumps, quick get-aways, no confederates, and a taste for good society\\u2014these ways had helped Mr. Valentine to become noted as a successful dodger of retribution. It was given out that Ben Price had taken up the trail of the elusive cracksman, and other people with burglar-proof safes felt more at ease.\\n\\nOne afternoon Jimmy Valentine and his suit-case climbed out of the mail-hack in Elmore, a little town five miles off the railroad down in the black-jack country of Arkansas. Jimmy, looking like an athletic young senior just home from college, went down the board side-walk toward the hotel.\\n\\nA young lady crossed the street, passed him at the corner and entered a door over which was the sign, \\\"The Elmore Bank.\\\" Jimmy Valentine looked into her eyes, forgot what he was, and became another man. She lowered her eyes and coloured slightly. Young men of Jimmy's style and looks were scarce in Elmore.\\n\\nJimmy collared a boy that was loafing on the steps of the bank as if he were one of the stockholders, and began to ask him questions about the town, feeding him dimes at intervals. By and by the young lady came out, looking royally unconscious of the young man with the suit-case, and went her way.\\n\\n\\\"Isn't that young lady Polly Simpson?\\\" asked Jimmy, with specious guile.\\n\\n\\\"Naw,\\\" said the boy. \\\"She's Annabel Adams. Her pa owns this bank. What'd you come to Elmore for? Is that a gold watch-chain? I'm going to get a bulldog. Got any more dimes?\\\"\\n\\nJimmy went to the Planters' Hotel, registered as Ralph D. Spencer, and engaged a room. He leaned on the desk and declared his platform to the clerk. He said he had come to Elmore to look for a location to go into business. How was the shoe business, now, in the town? He had thought of the shoe business. Was there an opening?\\n\\nThe clerk was impressed by the clothes and manner of Jimmy. He, himself, was something of a pattern of fashion to the thinly gilded youth of Elmore, but he now perceived his shortcomings. While trying to figure out Jimmy's manner of tying his four-in-hand he cordially gave information.\\n\\nYes, there ought to be a good opening in the shoe line. There wasn't an exclusive shoe-store in the place. The dry-goods and general stores handled them. Business in all lines was fairly good. Hoped Mr. Spencer would decide to locate in Elmore. He would find it a pleasant town to live in, and the people very sociable.\\n\\nMr. Spencer thought he would stop over in the town a few days and look over the situation. No, the clerk needn't call the boy. He would carry up his suit-case, himself; it was rather heavy.\\n\\nMr. Ralph Spencer, the ph\\u0153nix that arose from Jimmy Valentine's ashes\\u2014ashes left by the flame of a sudden and alterative attack of love\\u2014remained in Elmore, and prospered. He opened a shoe-store and secured a good run of trade.\\n\\nSocially he was also a success, and made many friends. And he accomplished the wish of his heart. He met Miss Annabel Adams, and became more and more captivated by her charms.\\n\\nAt the end of a year the situation of Mr. Ralph Spencer was this: he had won the respect of the community, his shoe-store was flourishing, and he and Annabel were engaged to be married in two weeks. Mr. Adams, the typical, plodding, country banker, approved of Spencer. Annabel's pride in him almost equalled her affection. He was as much at home in the family of Mr. Adams and that of Annabel's married sister as if he were already a member.\\n\\nOne day Jimmy sat down in his room and wrote this letter, which he mailed to the safe address of one of his old friends in St. Louis:\\n \\n\\n        Dear Old Pal:\\n\\n        I want you to be at Sullivan's place, in Little Rock, next Wednesday night, at nine o'clock. I want you to wind up some little matters for me. And, also, I want to make you a present of my kit of tools. I know you'll be glad to get them\\u2014you couldn't duplicate the lot for a thousand dollars. Say, Billy, I've quit the old business\\u2014a year ago. I've got a nice store. I'm making an honest living, and I'm going to marry the finest girl on earth two weeks from now. It's the only life, Billy\\u2014the straight one. I wouldn't touch a dollar of another man's money now for a million. After I get married I'm going to sell out and go West, where there won't be so much danger of having old scores brought up against me. I tell you, Billy, she's an angel. She believes in me; and I wouldn't do another crooked thing for the whole world. Be sure to be at Sully's, for I must see you. I'll bring along the tools with me.\\n\\n        Your old friend,\\n\\n        Jimmy.\\n         \\n\\nOn the Monday night after Jimmy wrote this letter, Ben Price jogged unobtrusively into Elmore in a livery buggy. He lounged about town in his quiet way until he found out what he wanted to know. From the drug-store across the street from Spencer's shoe-store he got a good look at Ralph D. Spencer.\\n\\n\\\"Going to marry the banker's daughter are you, Jimmy?\\\" said Ben to himself, softly. \\\"Well, I don't know!\\\"\\n\\nThe next morning Jimmy took breakfast at the Adamses. He was going to Little Rock that day to order his wedding-suit and buy something nice for Annabel. That would be the first time he had left town since he came to Elmore. It had been more than a year now since those last professional \\\"jobs,\\\" and he thought he could safely venture out.\\n\\nAfter breakfast quite a family party went downtown together\\u2014Mr. Adams, Annabel, Jimmy, and Annabel's married sister with her two little girls, aged five and nine. They came by the hotel where Jimmy still boarded, and he ran up to his room and brought along his suit-case. Then they went on to the bank. There stood Jimmy's horse and buggy and Dolph Gibson, who was going to drive him over to the railroad station.\\n\\nAll went inside the high, carved oak railings into the banking-room\\u2014Jimmy included, for Mr. Adams's future son-in-law was welcome anywhere. The clerks were pleased to be greeted by the good-looking, agreeable young man who was going to marry Miss Annabel. Jimmy set his suit-case down. Annabel, whose heart was bubbling with happiness and lively youth, put on Jimmy's hat, and picked up the suit-case. \\\"Wouldn't I make a nice drummer?\\\" said Annabel. \\\"My! Ralph, how heavy it is? Feels like it was full of gold bricks.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lot of nickel-plated shoe-horns in there,\\\" said Jimmy, coolly, \\\"that I'm going to return. Thought I'd save express charges by taking them up. I'm getting awfully economical.\\\"\\n\\nThe Elmore Bank had just put in a new safe and vault. Mr. Adams was very proud of it, and insisted on an inspection by every one. The vault was a small one, but it had a new, patented door. It fastened with three solid steel bolts thrown simultaneously with a single handle, and had a time-lock. Mr. Adams beamingly explained its workings to Mr. Spencer, who showed a courteous but not too intelligent interest. The two children, May and Agatha, were delighted by the shining metal and funny clock and knobs.\\n\\nWhile they were thus engaged Ben Price sauntered in and leaned on his elbow, looking casually inside between the railings. He told the teller that he didn't want anything; he was just waiting for a man he knew.\\n\\nSuddenly there was a scream or two from the women, and a commotion. Unperceived by the elders, May, the nine-year-old girl, in a spirit of play, had shut Agatha in the vault. She had then shot the bolts and turned the knob of the combination as she had seen Mr. Adams do.\\n\\nThe old banker sprang to the handle and tugged at it for a moment. \\\"The door can't be opened,\\\" he groaned. \\\"The clock hasn't been wound nor the combination set.\\\"\\n\\nAgatha's mother screamed again, hysterically.\\n\\n\\\"Hush!\\\" said Mr. Adams, raising his trembling hand. \\\"All be quite for a moment. Agatha!\\\" he called as loudly as he could. \\\"Listen to me.\\\" During the following silence they could just hear the faint sound of the child wildly shrieking in the dark vault in a panic of terror.\\n\\n\\\"My precious darling!\\\" wailed the mother. \\\"She will die of fright! Open the door! Oh, break it open! Can't you men do something?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There isn't a man nearer than Little Rock who can open that door,\\\" said Mr. Adams, in a shaky voice. \\\"My God! Spencer, what shall we do? That child\\u2014she can't stand it long in there. There isn't enough air, and, besides, she'll go into convulsions from fright.\\\"\\n\\nAgatha's mother, frantic now, beat the door of the vault with her hands. Somebody wildly suggested dynamite. Annabel turned to Jimmy, her large eyes full of anguish, but not yet despairing. To a woman nothing seems quite impossible to the powers of the man she worships.\\n\\n\\\"Can't you do something, Ralph \\u2014 try, won't you?\\\"\\n\\nHe looked at her with a queer, soft smile on his lips and in his keen eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Annabel,\\\" he said, \\\"give me that rose you are wearing, will you?\\\"\\n\\nHardly believing that she heard him aright, she unpinned the bud from the bosom of her dress, and placed it in his hand. Jimmy stuffed it into his vest-pocket, threw off his coat and pulled up his shirt-sleeves. With that act Ralph D. Spencer passed away and Jimmy Valentine took his place.\\n\\n\\\"Get away from the door, all of you,\\\" he commanded, shortly.\\n\\nHe set his suit-case on the table, and opened it out flat. From that time on he seemed to be unconscious of the presence of any one else. He laid out the shining, queer implements swiftly and orderly, whistling softly to himself as he always did when at work. In a deep silence and immovable, the others watched him as if under a spell.\\n\\nIn a minute Jimmy's pet drill was biting smoothly into the steel door. In ten minutes\\u2014breaking his own burglarious record\\u2014he threw back the bolts and opened the door.\\n\\nAgatha, almost collapsed, but safe, was gathered into her mother's arms.\\n\\nJimmy Valentine put on his coat, and walked outside the railings towards the front door. As he went he thought he heard a far-away voice that he once knew call \\\"Ralph!\\\" But he never hesitated.\\n\\nAt the door a big man stood somewhat in his way.\\n\\n\\\"Hello, Ben!\\\" said Jimmy, still with his strange smile. \\\"Got around at last, have you? Well, let's go. I don't know that it makes much difference, now.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then Ben Price acted rather strangely.\\n\\n\\\"Guess you're mistaken, Mr. Spencer,\\\" he said. \\\"Don't believe I recognize you. Your buggy's waiting for you, ain't it?\\\"\\n\\nAnd Ben Price turned and strolled down the street.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In this story, a man named Jimmy Valentine is released from prison on a pardon from the governor after serving nearly ten months of a four-year sentence.

That means fewer people to mess things up. And I can access everything up front.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a good plan and made the bank robber feel less like he had screwed up by coming in during the rush. \\u201cYou\\u2019re sure there are no alert switches or emergency phones in there?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a hundred years old,\\u201d she said. \\u201cYou couldn\\u2019t get a call out of there if you tried.\\u201d\\n\\nThe hostages all turned to see what he would say. He shifted his gun from one hand to the other.\\n\\n\\u201cFine,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThey all went to the old vault and the hostages filed in silently. There was plenty of room for them to sit or stand; they would be comfortable there. The teller turned an iron wheel to lock them in. \\u201cAll right,\\u201d she said. \\u201cLet\\u2019s get to work.\\u201d\\n\\nShe opened every teller station using keys on a ring she kept at her waist. He watched her stack the money in a duffelbag, one of two he had brought for the purpose. He was grateful for her knowledge and assistance, if a little unsettled that she was offering it all so freely.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re not putting a dye pack in there, are you?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\nThe woman turned to look at him, and he was surprised to see that his question seemed to have wounded her. \\u201cI would never,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWhat would make you say that?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d He tried to think about what would make him say it; he had seen a dye pack in a movie once and knew that it could explode and make a terrible mess. There was a lot that he didn\\u2019t know about robbing banks, and every moment was another opportunity to reveal his ignorance.\\n\\nShe seemed to sense his hesitation and plucked a pen from one of the teller stations, rolling it across the counter toward him. \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you go sit down over there and draft a taunting letter to the police,\\u201d she said. She pointed to the mortgage officers\\u2019 desks, which ringed the lobby.\\n\\nHe pulled back the leather chair behind one of the desks and sat. It felt funny to be behind a desk, dressed as he was in black fatigues. The bank robber couldn\\u2019t remember the last time he\\u2019d sat behind any desk, and he\\u2019d certainly never been near one this nice. He stared at the empty page. Writing had never interested him in school; though he knew he had something to say, it gave him an uneasy feeling. He put his gun in the outgoing-mail tray and dumped a box of paper clips onto the desk.\\n\\nThe woman noticed him stringing paper clips together. \\u201cYou could start with, \\u2018Fuck you, pigs, dumb motherfuckers,\\u2019 \\u201d she said. \\u201cOr, if you want it to be more personal, you could try, like, \\u2018I\\u2019m the motherfucking heist king and you know it.\\u2019 It depends on the tone you want.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMotherfucking heist king,\\u201d he repeated, writing it down.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re welcome.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d he said, a little annoyed. \\u201cThank you.\\u201d\\n\\nHe printed \\u201cMotherfucking Heist King\\u201d at the top of the page, then wrote it again and again, trying out different handwriting styles and lining the paper with a chain-link pattern. \\u201cMotherfucking Heist King\\u201d\\u2014it really was a nice phrase. Maybe if he could make a design with it, they would get the point of what he was trying to say. What was he trying to say, anyway? He realized that he hadn\\u2019t actually considered writing a letter until it was suggested to him.\\n\\nAfter a while, the teller came out from behind the counter to get his other bag. She looked over his shoulder at the page, which by then was covered in designs of his own creation. \\u201cWant me to write it?\\u201d she asked.\\n\\nHe handed her the paper and stood, surprised to find himself so irritated at someone who seemed only to want to help him. Walking to one of the high windows, he saw that a few police cars had begun to gather. \\u201cMaybe I should go,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nShe went back behind the counter with a pointed sigh and started to fill the second bag. He watched her poking around the cabinets. Outside, the police were setting up a barricade.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m going as fast as I can,\\u201d the teller said. She sounded angry. \\u201cI have to write your stupid letter and pack up this cash and get everything organized. I\\u2019m only one person.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI didn\\u2019t say anything.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThis obviously isn\\u2019t about me,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve seen this a million times before. You come in here for a little quick cash, you want to make a getaway. Am I wrong?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re the bitch who volunteered.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWow,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI guess I must have said something to deserve that.\\u201d\\n\\nShe sounded exactly like his mother, which the bank robber realized was just typical.\\n\\n\\u201cMaybe you should go and get in the vault now,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve helped me out. I appreciate you. I can take it from here.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, right,\\u201d she said. \\u201cYou think I\\u2019d let you finish this alone? I\\u2019ve done too much for you already to just walk away. I\\u2019m in it for the long haul.\\u201d She threw the last stacks of cash into the duffel so hard that it slid off the counter, sending its contents spilling across the floor.\\n\\nHe turned back to the window. If he just stayed out of her way, it would be over soon enough.\\n\\nGrumbling, she crouched down to clean it all up. At the very least, she figured, he could have helped when the bag fell. Thinking of others clearly wasn\\u2019t in his nature. She was actually getting pretty tired of his attitude: his inability to speak up, his dismal lack of self-confidence, his unwillingness to take a stand with either the hostages or the police. He didn\\u2019t have a point of view or an exit strategy, was content to remain in limbo. It was pathetic, really.\\n\\nWhen he approached the counter, the blank look on his face sickened her; it was the look of a man completely unable to understand the future or to confront it.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\nShe slid the bag across the counter and spread her arms wide, levelling upon him the full power of her scorn. \\u201cYou might as well just fucking shoot me,\\u201d she said.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In this story, a bank robbery takes an unexpected turn when the robber realizes that he was unprepared for the bank's afternoon rush.

Or using her.\\n\\nYou looking for someone, sister? he asks, lurking in the shadows, his cigarette bobbing as he speaks.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t know, she says.

He takes his hand off the revolver.\\n\\nWhen she turns to walk down the alley again, the gunman flicks his cigarette away and walks with her, moving as she moves. Left, right, left . . . it\\u2019s a kind of dance. She asks if he\\u2019s making fun of her. He says he doesn\\u2019t know how to make fun. In truth, he feels caught up in something fundamental. Benumbing. A feeling he hasn\\u2019t had before. Abstract, yet oddly erotic.\\n\\nIt won\\u2019t do any good, she says, reading him.\\n\\nYeah, I know, lady. But I like it.\\n\\nThey reach the dark end of the alley, still moving together, and turn back toward the swaying street lamp. The alley seems almost to fade away, the lamp\\u2019s glow to brighten.

Never mind. Worry about them when they do.\\n\\nWhen their dance ends, night has fully descended, sharpening the contrast between the pool of lamplight they have stepped into and the rest of the world, lost in the darkness beyond. That was great, he says. She looks up at him, her face pale but radiant in the light. She nods. Her sad smile seems to say, Yes, but it\\u2019s not enough, is it? She stares down at her feet, and when she does so, her face is masked in shadow. Is she about to betray him? he wonders. Does he care?\\n\\nShe starts suddenly, glances back down the alley. He follows her gaze. Uh-oh. Something is moving. His hand, too slowly, is inside his jacket. Watch out! she cries, and throws herself in front of him. A shot rings out. She collapses into his arms. Holding her, he fires impotently into the darkness. His bullets ricochet through the alley like ironic laughter. Hang on, baby! he pleads, but it\\u2019s too late.\\n\\nIt must be . . . why . . . she whispers, and dies in his arms.\\n\\nHis heart hardens again. Rage bites at the corners of his eyes.

Luke was on the assembly line, sticking the warning stickers on the interior frames of the coolers as they rolled by him at a rate of one every three seconds. Luke was a qualified electrician, but had shown up to work insufficiently sober one too many times, botched the wiring in one house too many\\u2014and then had to take whatever he could get.

There was a weird atmosphere in the plant that weekend, rumors spreading on the floor with a sour excitability, conjecture traded and revised at every canteen break. By Monday morning, the employees had put the pieces of a picture together. The consensus was that the bald man was an American, an emissary from the central office over in Massachusetts or Minnesota, Milwaukee or Manitoba, or wherever the hell the central office was, and that he was here to inform them the factory was going to go. On Monday afternoon, management sent out an e-mail advising of an exciting, company-wide root and branch realignment of resources, which would allow for a dramatic expansion in the company\\u2019s productivity and scale but that, also, somehow, involved cutting the human staff in the Irish plant by sixty per cent.\\n\\n\\u201cActually, the factory is fine.

The war would put an end to that ambition, but back then, when we were kids, the future was always on its way, its advance currents flowing through everything we knew or wanted to know.

The husband refuses to wear his hearing aid, causing him to frequently be unaware of the wife's presence.\\n\\nWith each call and unsuccessful response, the wife grows increasingly frustrated and resentful.

It was Olav who mentioned the place to me, at the start of our relationship. He told me that it\\u2019d been the summer cottage of the Norwegian author Knut Terje Aasbakken. Now it served as a writer\\u2019s retreat, and a narrow lane led up to it from the village Olav was from. As a child, he\\u2019d spy on the writers. They seemed so secretive, he said, and dived into me.\\n\\nAfter our relationship began to get complicated, a friend suggested I go away somewhere. So it was that I remembered Aasbakken\\u2019s cabin. The one on a mountainside, in a forest.\\n\\nI applied, got the cabin, and left at the beginning of September. A woman from the general store drove me from the village. She talked about the area as we crept up the mountain in her little Golf. On the way, we passed the community center. She said it was customary for whoever was in the cabin to give a reading in the center. I gazed down on the river in the valley, and then she dropped me off with a key to the woodshed.\\n\\nEvenings, I\\u2019d take a chair out in front of the cabin and try to stay there till I was shaking from the cold. In the mornings, I read, wrote zip. Late in the day I\\u2019d take a walk. And then one day I found myself at a standstill in front of the community-center notice board. \\u201cBUNADS,\\u201d the heading read, and under it was the name of Olav\\u2019s mother. She was called Halldis and taught the locals to sew their own folk costumes.\\n\\nThe days lasted an eternity, and at night the cold moved in. I walked around Aasbakken\\u2019s house and picked paint from the cabinet doors. Out in the forest, the mushrooms poked up, and it was impossible to escape the reading event in the community center. One evening in October, I positioned myself against a large loom-woven tapestry. During the coffee break, a woman with short dark hair and a face like an Inuit\\u2019s came over. She said, \\u201cI think you\\u2019ve met my son. He lives in Copenhagen.\\u201d I must have stared. \\u201cI\\u2019ve got an article he\\u2019s written about you,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nIn that way, I became sort of friends with Olav\\u2019s mother, Halldis. We agreed to go on some walks together. Later we also went out riding on her Fjord horses. She talked about the landscape, the kinds of tracks animals left, and how the winter we were entering would feel. We never spoke of Olav. It was my impression that she was a strong person, but at regular intervals she\\u2019d worry about whether I\\u2019d write about her.\\n\\nOne day in early November, we took the horses into the forest. When we came to a clearing, I said that the vista would make for a good opening scene. She said, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m so afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nI thought of Olav, his face and hers, and that might\\u2019ve been the day she invited me home for coffee. In any case, I remember that we let the horses loose in the pasture and sat in the kitchen. There were pictures of Olav and his wife on the bulletin board, and I\\u2019m sure that I gave Halldis a hug when I left.\\n\\nDespite the awkwardness in our relationship, we kept seeing each other. One day when we were in the kitchen, Olav\\u2019s father came in. He sat down at the table reluctantly, as we probably didn\\u2019t want to be disturbed. Halldis found him a coffee cup, and of course he was disturbing us. I recall him saying that he didn\\u2019t care for well-educated people. He was a carpenter, Olav\\u2019s father. Said that the hand\\u2019s labor was important and pointed to the table. I praised the table, and then I had to go and see his workshop.\\n\\nWe walked out to it, all three, and what I remember most clearly was that he\\u2019d stuck up a photo of a naked woman with a thumbtack. He\\u2019d pinned her up over the door to the room where Halldis worked on her costumes. That meant that Halldis had to walk under the naked woman anytime she went in and did her sewing. You never know about other people\\u2019s relationships, but I thought to myself that it was their marriage Halldis didn\\u2019t want me to write about. It seemed complicated to me, though I think it seemed healthy to her.\\n\\nEvery day she passed beneath the naked woman who hung over the door with her legs slightly spread, and she\\u2019d hung there so long that Halldis no longer noticed her. She was no doubt thinking of her son in Copenhagen. His wife was beautiful and industrious. He interviewed famous authors. And now one of them was living in Aasbakken\\u2019s cabin.\\n\\nThe cabin had no phone, so I ended up getting a letter. I have it still. He was angry, Olav. \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t have thought it of you,\\u201d he wrote.\\n\\nIn that sense, he wasn\\u2019t like his mother. I can recall another time we rode out together. It was a clear fall morning. On the outward part of our route, we rode past a lake. To me, Norwegian lakes feel bottomless, the landscape unknowable. Such uncertainty must leave its mark on the locals, I thought. Later, we went in among the trees, where it smelled of fungus and rot.\\n\\nAs we rode, we talked about how the forest looked lovely in its decay. I told her she resembled an Inuit, and that Olav must have got his features from her. She smiled at that, and there were birds of prey aloft, and moss upon the massive trunks of spruce, and I drank in everything I saw.\\n\\nThen one day, when we were drinking coffee in the kitchen and her husband came in, wanting attention, she actually began to tell a story. She looked at Olav\\u2019s father, asked him, \\u201cDo I dare to tell this?\\u201d and he said, \\u201cYes, just tell it.\\u201d\\n\\nAt first I thought she asked him whether she should tell the story because it was his, or because he decided which stories could be told in their relationship. In any case, she began telling it, though at times she\\u2019d put a hand over her mouth. \\u201cNo, I don\\u2019t know if I dare,\\u201d she said, glancing from her husband down into her cup.\\n\\nThe story concerned her cousin who had been married to a bad man.\\n\\nIt wasn\\u2019t until the man was dead that the cousin discovered just how bad he\\u2019d been. It came out from the estate and certain letters found with it. \\u201cBut you mustn\\u2019t write this story,\\u201d she said. She shouldn\\u2019t be worried, I said. \\u201cYour cousin\\u2019s husband wasn\\u2019t so out of the ordinary.\\u201d She asked, did I know such men? I said that now and then I ran into one. She asked if I wrote about them. \\u201cSometimes,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nI have the impression that during the time we spent together she managed to read my books. She mentioned one in particular. It had become winter, we were in the forest, and the surroundings creaked with snow and ice. She\\u2019d read the book but didn\\u2019t quite know what to think of it. She found the indecisiveness of the female protagonist especially hard to bear.\\n\\nWe crawled over an old stone wall. The sun was shining; my eyes hurt from all the whiteness. Recently, I saw an old photo from the gold-mining town of Yellowknife, near the Arctic Circle. It was a picture of an Inuit and then the sun, and the sun wasn\\u2019t alone. It had company. It\\u2019s an optical phenomenon\\u2014the sun\\u2019s light is refracted by ice crystals and two bright points appear, one on either side. Under the picture it said that the sun had been joined by its rivals, the ones that in the language of the prairie were called sun dogs.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat exactly are you afraid I\\u2019m going to write about?\\u201d I asked her. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nShe stood there and the light went right through her, that\\u2019s the way I remember it.\\n\\nHow the sun caused her physical form to cease.

The nanny has survived various historical events and always asks, \\\"So, did he get away?\\\" after hearing stories. This question leads to a discussion among guests about the significance of this question in relation to the Russian and Jewish people.\\n\\nLater, an anxious writer named G. becomes convinced that he has wronged his loved ones, leading him to call them multiple times a day to apologize for small things. Eventually, his loved ones send him a letter stating that they don't need a reason to hate him. This highlights G.'s paranoia and fear of not being loved.\\n\\nLastly, a translator named C. finds a way to solve his children's problems by refusing to do things for them, claiming that he, as an adult, should not have to pick up after them or do certain things. This strategy leads his children to become more independent and self-sufficient. However, C. begins to feel sick when he finds his son mimicking his words in an empty bathtub, making him question his own parenting approach.\\n\\nOverall, the story explores various aspects of human behavior, including violence, preference, rebellion, generational experiences, fear, and parenting techniques.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"In this collection of interconnected flash fiction stories, the author explores various scenarios and situations that highlight the complexity of human nature and relationships.\\n\\nIn the first story, a teacher engages with children discussing ethics and what they would do if they witness a bullying situation. One student surprises the teacher by proposing that the bullies should be stopped, yet amusingly adds that the person being bullied should then be finished off, showing the shades of human behavior.\\n\\nThe second story involves a father who goes through great effort to make homemade Hanukkah doughnuts for his daughter, only to be rejected with a simple \\\"I don't like it.\\\" However, the next day, the daughter enjoys store-bought doughnuts from a friend, revealing how individuals might have different preferences and the irony in the father's reaction.\\n\\nThe third story showcases a little boy in a crowded station whispering to his mother about his desire to let go and scream in the metro, hinting at the tensions underlying societal and personal expectations.\\n\\nThe fourth story revolves around a aged nanny who listens attentively to the family's stories throughout her life but each time asks, \\\"So, did he get away?\\\" sparking a debate among guests over whether the question symbolizes the Russian people or the Jewish people. Through her silence, the nanny represents the resilience of people living through challenging times.\\n\\nIn the fifth story, a paranoid writer ensures he asks forgiveness for every minor mistake he believes he makes, bombarding loved ones with calls until they send him a letter saying they don't need a reason to hate him. This paints a portrait of someone grappling with anxiety while trying to maintain relationships.\\n\\nThe final story features a translator named C. who ingeniously handles his children by refusing to solve problems for them. This alternative parenting strategy gets mixed results when the father finds his rule being taken to an extreme by his 9-year-old son, causing distress and potential regret.\\n\\nThese stories collectively explore themes of human psychology and relationship dynamics. The author subtly portrays the intricacies and unpredictability of human nature, providing readers with food for thought.\", \"story_token_count\": 1792, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 646, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 493}, {\"Title\": \"Citizen Punch\", \"Author\": \"Robert Coover\", \"story\": \"Citizen Punch, sitting under his humped back and sugarloaf hat on the lip of the little stage, his floppy legs dangling, is performing for the rowdy seaside audience below him. \\u201cLife is shit,\\u201d he says with his peculiar wheezle.\\n\\n\\u201cYay!\\u201d they yell.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople are better off dead!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYay!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGive me your money!\\u201d he says.

A red-haired woman came up afterward. He had seen her circling earlier, taking a chair at the back, but he had not troubled about it. \\u201cI knew you in the Congo,\\u201d she said now. \\u201cI knew your wife.\\u201d My wife? he thought, but, as always after a reading, in the retreating roar of his own soul he could barely hear her or remember how English worked. Had she said \\u201clife,\\u201d not \\u201cwife\\u201d? Her voice, that of a crow, thrust at him\\u2014some weekend they\\u2019d \\u201call spent together\\u201d and he\\u2019d sent her a letter the next day, a poem. Dread rose at the back of his mind; a parcel broke. He turned away, busied himself. He blamed, abhorred the touch of a past time; it surprised him how much. She followed him to the dinner that Charles (the London Librarian) had arranged at a nearby bistro, hurrying along behind everyone else, and, with the touch of his wife or his life burning like a toxin on his inside skin, Joseph Conrad could not meet her eyes or let pathos come clouding into him. When she seated herself at the foot of the table and was speaking loudly to anyone who listened, he felt the pluck of it on the side of his head but did not turn, he had to continue, now he\\u2019d begun, it was a long dinner. It was unjust. In other contexts, he admired perseverance. She was drowning. He did not turn. The light of pure reason, Joseph Conrad liked to say, resembles electricity in being cold. Proud statements like this came to him now and again when he was swimming but afterward seemed a bit off. No, it was a little nightmare, it was a rescue he could not carry out (and he was a rescuer).\\n\\nBut eventually the dinner ended. It was still 1907. No one had drowned. Shrugging into coats, they said hearty farewell things. He did not catch her eye. All left together to walk back toward the Library and go their ways. It was an early winter night. He began to feel fundamentally impatient with himself, hot with cowardice. He dropped back to walk beside her. His heartbeat was too fast. She did not seem surprised. An unknownness enveloped them, as if they were playing a game, as if they were draped in cloth or lost in old rooms. How they got to talking about white bread he could not remember afterward, but it shone in his mind, this conversation, as the bread had shone, and he was trying to tell her all that. Maybe she had mentioned lining up for bread in the early-morning dusk, sent out by her mother, running home with a loaf as heavy as two schoolbooks. When one dreamed of bread even now, Joseph Conrad agreed with her, it was not the rough black bread of childhood. Dream bread, mythic bread, was as white as a freshly laundered cuff.\\n\\nOnce, he had gone from London to visit his homeland and been invited to a christening in the countryside. It was June. On the drive, the weather closed in, matte gray and vague, typical summer weather for that region. The ceremony was as usual, in a tiny white church, where everyone sat packed like teeth and listened to short, glorious off-key songs sung by a ten-year-old girl, who was the sister of the new baby. The sun came out. Everyone rushed from the church. They stood amid graves, talking, amazed. Vast general fields reached away on every side to the mountains. He recalled the feeling of being a small mark at the center of a greenness so dazzlingly revealed it hurt the eyes. Soon, they embarked in cars and drove to a nearby farmhouse for lunch, sunlight still spilling over everything.\\n\\nThe farmhouse stood with all doors open, children tumbling in and out, busy conversation everywhere. He knew scarcely anyone, so stood in an inner room, mastering it in case he would one day write about it, near a table draped in a lace cloth and heavy with cakes. There was a cake as big as two schoolbooks\\u2014he smilingly used her analogy\\u2014emblazoned with the name of the new baby. A chocolate cake shaped like a bear and full of candies that erupted for the children. Many fluffy cream cakes and several tall block-like structures layered with red jam. There were also other smaller foods, shrimp on crackers and so forth, and, finally, carried in late with a sort of hasty deference, on its own blue-patterned china plate, a stack of sliced white bread. The plate was placed, as it happened, in a shaft of sunlight, and the white bread shone, in its own piety, on the lace in that shadowy room, set into the history of a sunlit afternoon on an ancient property amid fields stretching to the ends of the mind.\\n\\nNo one ate the white bread. It wasn\\u2019t there to be eaten. It was a chapter of civilization. He had lived that chapter and so had she, this red-haired woman, in the poor places and poor childish times when a glowing heap of crispy loaves in a shop window was twice as radiant as the rubies or diamonds on display at the jeweller\\u2019s down the street. The two of them stood in front of the London Library, tossed out of memory, dazed by the sexual nearness of something ultimate. An adoration without hope. She was starting to say something about metaphors, metaphors being also real, which didn\\u2019t interest him.

He pulled himself around him and escaped.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Joseph Conrad, the acclaimed author, gives a reading at the London Library.

For the first time that evening, he tried to distinguish faces. Many of them were colored. Faces of color. Not a bad thing. His best friend was Egyptian.\\n\\nA microphone was passed to the first questioner, a brown-skinned man. \\u201cThank you for your talk, Dr. Jones. I\\u2019m wondering about the Indian village, the one that sent you on your quest to retrieve a mystical stone.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe Sankara stone, correct.

Shaman.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCorrect.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSo if I went to this Mayapore and went around asking for a guy named Shaman, people would be, like, yeah, Shaman lives over on, I dunno, Cherokee Street.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cLook, pal, I don\\u2019t know what your problem is\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy problem is that all these names sound made up.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAll names are made up. Hey, I was named after my pet dog!\\u201d\\n\\nSome people laughed. Indy prompted the next question.\\n\\nIt came from a pretty woman in a clingy skirt. \\u201cHi, Dr. Jones,\\u201d she said, and, as she went on, he found himself recalling a student, a girl, from his teaching days. \\u201cYou mentioned that, at the Maharajah\\u2019s banquet, you were served a dessert of chilled monkey brains?\\u201d\\n\\nHe nodded, still thinking of the student who used to sit in the front row of his history class. Once, on her eyelids, she\\u2019d written him a message. \\u201cLove\\u201d on the right lid, and \\u201cYou\\u201d on the left.\\n\\n\\u201cSome say this idea of Asians eating monkey brains is an urban legend, based on a misunderstanding of the Chinese h\\u00f3u t\\u00f3u g\\u016b, which translates to \\u2018monkey-head mushroom.\\u2019 Could it be that you ate monkey-head-mushroom soup? It\\u2019s a Manchurian dish.\\u201d\\n\\nIndy recalled the way his former student had closed and opened her eyes. Love you. Love you. It was sort of disgusting to think of her writing on her own eyelids. But kind of amazing, too. What wouldn\\u2019t she do?\\n\\n\\u201cDr. Jones?\\u201d the questioner said.\\n\\nIndy looked to the moderator, who was also looking at him, illegibly. \\u201cI just ate what I was told to eat,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nSilence. He took a long gulp of water.\\n\\nThe world had grown unfriendly to his form of research. What he wouldn\\u2019t give to be back in the jungles of Honduras or jumping trains across Nazi-occupied Europe, where he could let his whip do the talking. He\\u2019d taken this gig for the honorarium, mainly.\\n\\nFor the final question, the moderator pointed to a tiny woman with billowing black hair. \\u201cMr. Jones,\\u201d she said, already annoying him, for he had a Ph.D. \\u201cHow would you respond to the claim that you\\u2019re more of a grave robber than an archeologist?

Have you been whipped and force-fed the blood of Kali? Have you been crippled by a voodoo doll? I did all that, not for myself but for the villagers of that village and their children. I\\u2019m the good guy here, not the bad guy.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDr. Jones,\\u201d the moderator said, \\u201cthe question had to do with looted objects\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, guess what, joke\\u2019s on you. . . .\\u201d His voice trailed off. He was thinking of the Holy Grail, the cup of the king of kings, falling out of his grasp, tumbling into a chasm beneath the Temple of the Sun. And wasn\\u2019t it always like that? Hadn\\u2019t every object he\\u2019d ever loved finally eluded him, vanishing even further into the vault of history? Quietly he said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never put anything in a museum.\\u201d\\n\\nHe looked at the floor. The general murmur was excruciating.\\n\\nEventually, he heard the gentle voice of the moderator: \\u201cIndiana . . . Indiana . . .\\u201d\\n\\nHer tone sounded so much like his father\\u2019s right then.

Deep down, he had always known.\\n\\n\\u201cCan we agree, Indy, that India was a misstep? That you should stick to fighting Nazis?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTheoretically, sure, but the Nazi party is defunct.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd yet there are still Nazis. There will always be Nazis.\\u201d\\n\\nHe frowned, suspicious. As he looked out at the audience, he could see waves of nodding faces, confirming the ever-presence of Nazis. His gaze fixed on the red exit sign, glowing like the fiery Sankara stone.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, then,\\u201d he said, \\u201cI guess I\\u2019ve got work to do.\\u201d\\n\\nHe reached down beneath his chair and retrieved the fedora he\\u2019d stored behind his ankles all this time, the hat that had seen him through every adventure, and set it on his head.

The audience questions him about specific incidents, such as his encounter with a demonic cult in an Indian village and his consumption of chilled monkey brains. The audience members also challenge him on the ethical implications of keeping the artifacts in European museums instead of returning them to their original locations. \\n\\nIndiana initially brushes off the criticism, defending his actions as necessary to protect the villagers and their children. However, he begins to question himself and his role when he realizes that he has never actually placed any of the artifacts he has found in a museum. Reflecting on his past adventures and the loss of precious relics, such as the Holy Grail, Indiana starts to feel that he has failed in preserving history. \\n\\nThe moderator of the panel discussion empathizes with Indiana, acknowledging that many people find him heroic and attractive, but she also expresses the confusion and anger felt by some regarding his actions. She suggests that Indiana should focus on fighting Nazis, as they are always a threat. Indiana, feeling a strong sense of purpose, immediately puts on his iconic fedora and sets off, determined to continue his adventures and fight against Nazis.\\n\\nAs Indiana leaves the stage and walks through the audience, uncertain applause follows him, highlighting the appreciation and support he still receives despite the criticism.

The car was empty. He had nothing planned that day. Wherever he went and whatever he did (or didn\\u2019t do) was entirely up to him. It was ten o\\u2019clock on a windless summer morning, and the sun was beating down. The train passed Shinjuku, Yotsuya, Ochanomizu, and arrived at Tokyo Central Station, the end of the line. Everyone got off, and Tengo followed suit. Then he sat on a bench and gave some thought to where he should go. \\u201cI can go anywhere I decide to,\\u201d he told himself. \\u201cIt looks as if it\\u2019s going to be a hot day. I could go to the seashore.\\u201d He raised his head and studied the platform guide.\\n\\nAt that point, he realized what he had been doing all along.\\n\\nHe tried shaking his head a few times, but the idea that had struck him would not go away. He had probably made up his mind unconsciously the moment he boarded the Chuo Line train in Koenji. He heaved a sigh, stood up from the bench, and asked a station employee for the fastest connection to Chikura. The man flipped through the pages of a thick volume of train schedules. He should take the 11:30 special express train to Tateyama, the man said, and transfer there to a local; he would arrive at Chikura shortly after two o\\u2019clock. Tengo bought a Tokyo-Chikura round-trip ticket. Then he went to a restaurant in the station and ordered rice and curry and a salad.\\n\\nGoing to see his father was a depressing prospect. He had never much liked the man, and his father had no special love for him, either. He had retired four years earlier and, soon afterward, entered a sanatorium in Chikura that specialized in patients with cognitive disorders. Tengo had visited him there no more than twice\\u2014the first time just after he had entered the facility, when a procedural problem required Tengo, as the only relative, to be there. The second visit had also involved an administrative matter. Two times: that was it.\\n\\nThe sanatorium stood on a large plot of land by the coast. It was an odd combination of elegant old wooden buildings and new three-story reinforced-concrete buildings. The air was fresh, however, and, aside from the roar of the surf, it was always quiet. An imposing pine grove formed a windbreak along the edge of the garden. And the medical facilities were excellent. With his health insurance, retirement bonus, savings, and pension, Tengo\\u2019s father could probably spend the rest of his life there quite comfortably. He might not leave behind any sizable inheritance, but at least he would be taken care of, for which Tengo was tremendously grateful. Tengo had no intention of taking anything from him or giving anything to him. They were two separate human beings who had come from\\u2014and were heading toward\\u2014entirely different places. By chance, they had spent some years of life together\\u2014that was all. It was a shame that it had come to that, but there was absolutely nothing that Tengo could do about it.\\n\\nTengo paid his check and went to the platform to wait for the Tateyama train. His only fellow-passengers were happy-looking families heading out for a few days at the beach.\\n\\nMost people think of Sunday as a day of rest. Throughout his childhood, however, Tengo had never once viewed Sunday as a day to enjoy. For him, Sunday was like a misshapen moon that showed only its dark side. When the weekend came, his whole body began to feel sluggish and achy, and his appetite would disappear. He had even prayed for Sunday not to come, though his prayers were never answered.\\n\\nWhen Tengo was a boy, his father was a collector of subscription fees for NHK\\u2014Japan\\u2019s quasi-governmental radio and television network\\u2014and, every Sunday, he would take Tengo with him as he went door to door soliciting payment. Tengo had started going on these rounds before he entered kindergarten and continued through fifth grade without a single weekend off. He had no idea whether other NHK fee collectors worked on Sundays, but, for as long as he could remember, his father always had. If anything, his father worked with even more enthusiasm than usual, because on Sundays he could catch the people who were usually out during the week.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father had several reasons for taking him along on his rounds. One reason was that he could not leave the boy at home alone. On weekdays and Saturdays, Tengo could go to school or to day care, but these institutions were closed on Sundays. Another reason, Tengo\\u2019s father said, was that it was important for a father to show his son what kind of work he did. A child should learn early on what activity was supporting him, and he should appreciate the importance of labor. Tengo\\u2019s father had been sent out to work in the fields on his father\\u2019s farm, on Sunday like any other day, from the time he was old enough to understand anything. He had even been kept out of school during the busiest seasons. To him, such a life was a given.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father\\u2019s third and final reason was a more calculating one, which was why it had left the deepest scars on his son\\u2019s heart. Tengo\\u2019s father was well aware that having a small child with him made his job easier. Even people who were determined not to pay often ended up forking over the money when a little boy was staring up at them, which was why Tengo\\u2019s father saved his most difficult routes for Sunday. Tengo sensed from the beginning that this was the role he was expected to play, and he absolutely hated it. But he also felt that he had to perform it as cleverly as he could in order to please his father. If he pleased his father, he would be treated kindly that day. He might as well have been a trained monkey.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s one consolation was that his father\\u2019s beat was fairly far from home. They lived in a suburban residential district outside the city of Ichikawa, and his father\\u2019s rounds were in the center of the city. At least he was able to avoid doing collections at the homes of his classmates. Occasionally, though, while walking in the downtown shopping area, he would spot a classmate on the street. When this happened, he ducked behind his father to keep from being noticed.\\n\\nOn Monday mornings, his school friends would talk excitedly about where they had gone and what they had done the day before. They went to amusement parks and zoos and baseball games. In the summer, they went swimming, in the winter skiing. But Tengo had nothing to talk about. From morning to evening on Sundays, he and his father rang the doorbells of strangers\\u2019 houses, bowed their heads, and took money from whoever came to the door. If people didn\\u2019t want to pay, his father would threaten or cajole them. If they tried to talk their way out of paying, his father would raise his voice. Sometimes he would curse at them like stray dogs. Such experiences were not the sort of thing that Tengo could share with friends. He could not help feeling like a kind of alien in the society of middle-class children of white-collar workers. He lived a different kind of life in a different world. Luckily, his grades were outstanding, as was his athletic ability. So even though he was an alien he was never an outcast. In most circumstances, he was treated with respect. But whenever the other boys invited him to go somewhere or to visit their homes on a Sunday he had to turn them down. Soon, they stopped asking.\\n\\nBorn the third son of a farming family in the hardscrabble Tohoku region, Tengo\\u2019s father had left home as soon as he could, joining a homesteaders\\u2019 group and crossing over to Manchuria in the nineteen-thirties. He had not believed the government\\u2019s claims that Manchuria was a paradise where the land was vast and rich. He knew enough to realize that \\u201cparadise\\u201d was not to be found anywhere. He was simply poor and hungry. The best he could hope for if he stayed at home was a life on the brink of starvation. In Manchuria, he and the other homesteaders were given some farming implements and small arms, and together they started cultivating the land. The soil was poor and rocky, and in winter everything froze. Sometimes stray dogs were all they had to eat. Even so, with government support for the first few years they managed to get by. Their lives were finally becoming more stable when, in August, 1945, the Soviet Union launched a full-scale invasion of Manchuria. Tengo\\u2019s father had been expecting this to happen, having been secretly informed of the impending situation by a certain official, a man he had become friendly with. The minute he heard the news that the Soviets had violated the border, he mounted his horse, galloped to the local train station, and boarded the second-to-last train for Da-lien. He was the only one among his farming companions to make it back to Japan before the end of the year.\\n\\nAfter the war, Tengo\\u2019s father went to Tokyo and tried to make a living as a black marketeer and as a carpenter\\u2019s apprentice, but he could barely keep himself alive. He was working as a liquor-store deliveryman in Asakusa when he bumped into his old friend the official he had known in Manchuria. When the man learned that Tengo\\u2019s father was having a hard time finding a decent job, he offered to recommend him to a friend in the subscription department of NHK, and Tengo\\u2019s father gladly accepted. He knew almost nothing about NHK, but he was willing to try anything that promised a steady income.\\n\\nAt NHK, Tengo\\u2019s father carried out his duties with great gusto. His foremost strength was his perseverance in the face of adversity. To someone who had barely eaten a filling meal since birth, collecting NHK fees was not excruciating work. The most hostile curses hurled at him were nothing. Moreover, he felt satisfaction at belonging to an important organization, even as one of its lowest-ranking members. His performance and attitude were so outstanding that, after a year as a commissioned collector, he was taken directly into the ranks of the full-fledged employees, an almost unheard-of achievement at NHK. Soon, he was able to move into a corporation-owned apartment and join the company\\u2019s health-care plan. It was the greatest stroke of good fortune he had ever had in his life.\\n\\nYoung Tengo\\u2019s father never sang him lullabies, never read books to him at bedtime. Instead, he told the boy stories of his actual experiences. He was a good storyteller. His accounts of his childhood and youth were not exactly pregnant with meaning, but the details were lively. There were funny stories, moving stories, and violent stories. If a life can be measured by the color and variety of its episodes, Tengo\\u2019s father\\u2019s life had been rich in its own way, perhaps. But when his stories touched on the period after he became an NHK employee they suddenly lost all vitality. He had met a woman, married her, and had a child\\u2014Tengo. A few months after Tengo was born, his mother had fallen ill and died. His father had raised him alone after that, while working hard for NHK. The End. How he happened to meet Tengo\\u2019s mother and marry her, what kind of woman she was, what had caused her death, whether her death had been an easy one or she had suffered greatly\\u2014Tengo\\u2019s father told him almost nothing about such matters. If he tried asking, his father just evaded the questions. Most of the time, such questions put him in a foul mood. Not a single photograph of Tengo\\u2019s mother had survived.\\n\\nTengo fundamentally disbelieved his father\\u2019s story. He knew that his mother hadn\\u2019t died a few months after he was born. In his only memory of her, he was a year and a half old and she was standing by his crib in the arms of a man other than his father. His mother took off her blouse, dropped the straps of her slip, and let the man who was not his father suck on her breasts. Tengo slept beside them, his breathing audible. But, at the same time, he was not asleep. He was watching his mother.\\n\\nThis was Tengo\\u2019s photograph of his mother. The ten-second scene was burned into his brain with perfect clarity. It was the only concrete information he had about her, the one tenuous connection his mind could make with her. He and she were linked by this hypothetical umbilical cord. His father, however, had no idea that this vivid scene existed in Tengo\\u2019s memory, or that, like a cow in a meadow, Tengo was endlessly regurgitating fragments of it to chew on, a cud from which he obtained essential nutrients. Father and son: each was locked in a deep, dark embrace with his own secrets.\\n\\nAs an adult, Tengo often wondered if the young man sucking on his mother\\u2019s breasts in his vision was his biological father. This was because Tengo in no way resembled his father, the stellar NHK collections agent. Tengo was a tall, strapping man with a broad forehead, a narrow nose, and tightly balled ears. His father was short and squat and utterly unimpressive. He had a small forehead, a flat nose, and pointed ears like a horse\\u2019s. Where Tengo had a relaxed and generous look, his father appeared nervous and tightfisted. Comparing the two of them, people often openly remarked on their dissimilarity.\\n\\nStill, it was not their physical features that made it difficult for Tengo to identify with his father but their psychological makeup. His father showed no sign at all of what might be called intellectual curiosity. True, having been born in poverty he had not had a decent education. Tengo felt a degree of pity for his father\\u2019s circumstances. But a basic desire to obtain knowledge\\u2014which Tengo assumed to be a more or less natural urge in people\\u2014was lacking in the man. He had a certain practical wisdom that enabled him to survive, but Tengo could discern no hint of a willingness in his father to deepen himself, to view a wider, larger world. Tengo\\u2019s father never seemed to suffer discomfort from the stagnant air of his cramped little life. Tengo never once saw him pick up a book. He had no interest in music or movies, and he never took a trip. The only thing that seemed to interest him was his collection route. He would make a map of the area, mark it with colored pens, and examine it whenever he had a spare moment, the way a biologist might study chromosomes.\\n\\nTengo, by contrast, was curious about everything. He absorbed knowledge from a broad range of fields with the efficiency of a power shovel scooping earth. He had been regarded as a math prodigy from early childhood, and he could solve high-school math problems by the time he was in third grade. Math was, for young Tengo, an effective means of retreat from his life with his father. In the mathematical world, he would walk down a long corridor, opening one numbered door after another. Each time a new spectacle unfolded before him, the ugly traces of the real world would simply disappear. As long as he was actively exploring that realm of infinite consistency, he was free.\\n\\nWhile math was like a magnificent imaginary building for Tengo, literature was a vast magical forest. Math stretched infinitely upward toward the heavens, but stories spread out before him, their sturdy roots stretching deep into the earth. In this forest there were no maps, no doorways. As Tengo got older, the forest of story began to exert an even stronger pull on his heart than the world of math. Of course, reading novels was just another form of escape\\u2014as soon as he closed the book, he had to come back to the real world. But at some point he noticed that returning to reality from the world of a novel was not as devastating a blow as returning from the world of math. Why was that? After much thought, he reached a conclusion. No matter how clear things might become in the forest of story, there was never a clear-cut solution, as there was in math. The role of a story was, in the broadest terms, to transpose a problem into another form. Depending on the nature and the direction of the problem, a solution might be suggested in the narrative. Tengo would return to the real world with that suggestion in hand. It was like a piece of paper bearing the indecipherable text of a magic spell. It served no immediate practical purpose, but it contained a possibility.\\n\\nThe one possible solution that Tengo was able to decipher from his readings was this one: My real father must be somewhere else. Like an unfortunate child in a Dickens novel, Tengo had perhaps been led by strange circumstances to be raised by this impostor. Such a possibility was both a nightmare and a great hope. After reading \\u201cOliver Twist,\\u201d Tengo plowed through every Dickens volume in the library. As he travelled through Dickens\\u2019s stories, he steeped himself in reimagined versions of his own life. These fantasies grew ever longer and more complex. They followed a single pattern, but with infinite variations. In all of them, Tengo would tell himself that his father\\u2019s home was not where he belonged. He had been mistakenly locked in this cage, and someday his real parents would find him and rescue him. Then he would have the most beautiful, peaceful, and free Sundays imaginable.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father prided himself on his son\\u2019s excellent grades, and boasted of them to people in the neighborhood. At the same time, however, he showed a certain displeasure with Tengo\\u2019s brightness and talent. Often when Tengo was at his desk, studying, his father would interrupt him, ordering the boy to do chores or nagging him about his supposedly offensive behavior. The content of his father\\u2019s nagging was always the same: here he was, running himself ragged every day, covering huge distances and enduring people\\u2019s curses, while Tengo did nothing but take it easy all the time, living in comfort. \\u201cThey had me working my tail off when I was your age, and my father and older brothers would beat me black and blue for anything at all. They never gave me enough food. They treated me like an animal. I don\\u2019t want you thinking you\\u2019re so special just because you got a few good grades.\\u201d\\n\\nThis man is envious of me, Tengo began to think at a certain point. He\\u2019s jealous, either of me as a person or of the life I\\u2019m leading. But would a father really feel jealousy toward his son? Tengo did not judge his father, but he could not help sensing a pathetic kind of meanness emanating from his words and deeds. It was not that Tengo\\u2019s father hated him as a person but, rather, that he hated something inside Tengo, something that he could not forgive.\\n\\nWhen the train left Tokyo Station, Tengo took out the paperback that he had brought along. It was an anthology of short stories on the theme of travel and it included a tale called \\u201cTown of Cats,\\u201d a fantastical piece by a German writer with whom Tengo was not familiar. According to the book\\u2019s foreword, the story had been written in the period between the two World Wars.\\n\\nIn the story, a young man is travelling alone with no particular destination in mind. He rides the train and gets off at any stop that arouses his interest. He takes a room, sees the sights, and stays for as long as he likes. When he has had enough, he boards another train. He spends every vacation this way.\\n\\nOne day, he sees a lovely river from the train window. Gentle green hills line the meandering stream, and below them lies a pretty little town with an old stone bridge. The train stops at the town\\u2019s station, and the young man steps down with his bag. No one else gets off, and, as soon as he alights, the train departs.\\n\\nNo workers man the station, which must see very little activity. The young man crosses the bridge and walks into the town. All the shops are shuttered, the town hall deserted. No one occupies the desk at the town\\u2019s only hotel. The place seems totally uninhabited. Perhaps all the people are off napping somewhere. But it is only ten-thirty in the morning, far too early for that. Perhaps something has caused all the people to abandon the town. In any case, the next train will not come until the following morning, so he has no choice but to spend the night here. He wanders around the town to kill time.\\n\\nIn fact, this is a town of cats. When the sun starts to go down, many cats come trooping across the bridge\\u2014cats of all different kinds and colors. They are much larger than ordinary cats, but they are still cats. The young man is shocked by this sight. He rushes into the bell tower in the center of town and climbs to the top to hide. The cats go about their business, raising the shop shutters or seating themselves at their desks to start their day\\u2019s work. Soon, more cats come, crossing the bridge into town like the others. They enter the shops to buy things or go to the town hall to handle administrative matters or eat a meal at the hotel restaurant or drink beer at the tavern and sing lively cat songs. Because cats can see in the dark, they need almost no lights, but that particular night the glow of the full moon floods the town, enabling the young man to see every detail from his perch in the bell tower. When dawn approaches, the cats finish their work, close up the shops, and swarm back across the bridge.\\n\\nBy the time the sun comes up, the cats are gone, and the town is deserted again. The young man climbs down, picks one of the hotel beds for himself, and goes to sleep. When he gets hungry, he eats some bread and fish that have been left in the hotel kitchen. When darkness approaches, he hides in the bell tower again and observes the cats\\u2019 activities until dawn. Trains stop at the station before noon and in the late afternoon. No passengers alight, and no one boards, either. Still, the trains stop at the station for exactly one minute, then pull out again. He could take one of these trains and leave the creepy cat town behind. But he doesn\\u2019t. Being young, he has a lively curiosity and is ready for adventure. He wants to see more of this strange spectacle. If possible, he wants to find out when and how this place became a town of cats.\\n\\nOn his third night, a hubbub breaks out in the square below the bell tower. \\u201cHey, do you smell something human?\\u201d one of the cats says. \\u201cNow that you mention it, I thought there was a funny smell the past few days,\\u201d another chimes in, twitching his nose. \\u201cMe, too,\\u201d yet another cat says. \\u201cThat\\u2019s weird. There shouldn\\u2019t be any humans here,\\u201d someone adds. \\u201cNo, of course not. There\\u2019s no way a human could get into this town of cats.\\u201d \\u201cBut that smell is definitely here.\\u201d\\n\\nThe cats form groups and begin to search the town like bands of vigilantes. It takes them very little time to discover that the bell tower is the source of the smell. The young man hears their soft paws padding up the stairs. That\\u2019s it, they\\u2019ve got me! he thinks. His smell seems to have roused the cats to anger. Humans are not supposed to set foot in this town. The cats have big, sharp claws and white fangs. He has no idea what terrible fate awaits him if he is discovered, but he is sure that they will not let him leave the town alive.\\n\\nThree cats climb to the top of the bell tower and sniff the air. \\u201cStrange,\\u201d one cat says, twitching his whiskers, \\u201cI smell a human, but there\\u2019s no one here.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt is strange,\\u201d a second cat says. \\u201cBut there really isn\\u2019t anyone here. Let\\u2019s go and look somewhere else.\\u201d\\n\\nThe cats cock their heads, puzzled, then retreat down the stairs. The young man hears their footsteps fading into the dark of night. He breathes a sigh of relief, but he doesn\\u2019t understand what just happened. There was no way they could have missed him. But for some reason they didn\\u2019t see him. In any case, he decides that when morning comes he will go to the station and take the train out of this town. His luck can\\u2019t last forever.\\n\\nThe next morning, however, the train does not stop at the station. He watches it pass by without slowing down. The afternoon train does the same. He can see the engineer seated at the controls. But the train shows no sign of stopping. It is as though no one can see the young man waiting for a train\\u2014or even see the station itself. Once the afternoon train disappears down the track, the place grows quieter than ever. The sun begins to sink. It is time for the cats to come. The young man knows that he is irretrievably lost. This is no town of cats, he finally realizes. It is the place where he is meant to be lost. It is another world, which has been prepared especially for him. And never again, for all eternity, will the train stop at this station to take him back to the world he came from.\\n\\nTengo read the story twice. The phrase \\u201cthe place where he is meant to be lost\\u201d attracted his attention. He closed the book and let his eyes wander across the drab industrial scene passing by the train window. Soon afterward, he drifted off to sleep\\u2014not a long nap but a deep one. He woke covered in sweat. The train was moving along the southern coastline of the Boso Peninsula in midsummer.\\n\\nOne morning when he was in fifth grade, after much careful thinking, Tengo declared that he was going to stop making the rounds with his father on Sundays. He told his father that he wanted to use the time for studying and reading books and playing with other kids. He wanted to live a normal life like everybody else.\\n\\nTengo said what he needed to say, concisely and coherently.\\n\\nHis father, of course, blew up. He didn\\u2019t give a damn what other families did, he said. \\u201cWe have our own way of doing things. And don\\u2019t you dare talk to me about a \\u2018normal life,\\u2019 Mr. Know-It-All. What do you know about a \\u2018normal life\\u2019?\\u201d Tengo did not try to argue with him. He merely stared back in silence, knowing that nothing he said would get through to his father. Finally, his father told him that if he wouldn\\u2019t listen then he couldn\\u2019t go on feeding him. Tengo should get the hell out.\\n\\nTengo did as he was told. He had made up his mind. He was not going to be afraid. Now that he had been given permission to leave his cage, he was more relieved than anything else. But there was no way that a ten-year-old boy could live on his own. When his class was dismissed at the end of the day, he confessed his predicament to his teacher. The teacher was a single woman in her mid-thirties, a fair-minded, warmhearted person. She heard Tengo out with sympathy, and that evening she took him back to his father\\u2019s place for a long talk.\\n\\nTengo was told to leave the room, so he was not sure what they said to each other, but finally his father had to sheathe his sword. However extreme his anger might be, he could not leave a ten-year-old boy to wander the streets alone. The duty of a parent to support his child was a matter of law.\\n\\nAs a result of the teacher\\u2019s talk with his father, Tengo was free to spend Sundays as he pleased. This was the first tangible right that he had ever won from his father. He had taken his first step toward freedom and independence.\\n\\nAt the reception desk of the sanatorium, Tengo gave his name and his father\\u2019s name.\\n\\nThe nurse asked, \\u201cHave you by any chance notified us of your intention to visit today?\\u201d There was a hard edge to her voice. A small woman, she wore metal-framed glasses, and her short hair had a touch of gray.\\n\\n\\u201cNo, it just occurred to me to come this morning and I hopped on a train,\\u201d Tengo answered honestly.\\n\\nThe nurse gave him a look of mild disgust. Then she said, \\u201cVisitors are supposed to notify us before they arrive to see a patient. We have our schedules to meet, and the wishes of the patient must also be taken into account.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry. I didn\\u2019t know.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhen was your last visit?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTwo years ago.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTwo years ago,\\u201d she said as she checked the list of visitors with a ballpoint pen in hand. \\u201cYou mean to say that you have not made a single visit in two years?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s right,\\u201d Tengo said.\\n\\n\\u201cAccording to our records, you are Mr. Kawana\\u2019s only relative.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat is correct.\\u201d\\n\\nShe glanced at Tengo, but she said nothing. Her eyes were not blaming him, just checking the facts. Apparently, Tengo\\u2019s case was not exceptional.\\n\\n\\u201cAt the moment, your father is in group rehabilitation. That will end in half an hour. You can see him then.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow is he doing?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPhysically, he\\u2019s healthy. It\\u2019s in the other area that he has his ups and downs,\\u201d she said, tapping her temple with an index finger.\\n\\nTengo thanked her and went to wait in the lounge by the entrance, reading more of his book. A breeze passed through now and then, carrying the scent of the sea and the cooling sound of the pine windbreak outside. Cicadas clung to the branches of the trees, screeching their hearts out. Summer was at its height, but the cicadas seemed to know that it would not last long.\\n\\nEventually, the bespectacled nurse came to tell Tengo that he could see his father now. \\u201cI\\u2019ll show you to his room,\\u201d she said. Tengo got up from the sofa and, passing by a large mirror on the wall, realized for the first time what a sloppy outfit he was wearing: a Jeff Beck Japan Tour T-shirt under a faded dungaree shirt with mismatched buttons, chinos with specks of pizza sauce near one knee, a baseball cap\\u2014no way for a thirty-year-old son to dress on his first hospital visit to his father in two years. Nor did he have anything with him that might serve as a gift on such an occasion. No wonder the nurse had given him that look of disgust.\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father was in his room, sitting in a chair by the open window, his hands on his knees. A nearby table held a potted plant with several delicate yellow flowers. The floor was made of some soft material to prevent injury in case of a fall. Tengo did not realize at first that the old man seated by the window was his father. He had shrunk\\u2014\\u201cshrivelled up\\u201d might be more accurate. His hair was shorter and as white as a frost-covered lawn. His cheeks were sunken, which may have been why the hollows of his eyes looked much bigger than they had before. Three deep creases marked his forehead. His eyebrows were extremely long and thick, and his pointed ears were larger than ever; they looked like bat wings. From a distance, he seemed less like a human being than like some kind of creature, a rat or a squirrel\\u2014a creature with some cunning. He was, however, Tengo\\u2019s father\\u2014or, rather, the wreckage of Tengo\\u2019s father. The father that Tengo remembered was a tough, hardworking man. Introspection and imagination might have been foreign to him, but he had his own moral code and a strong sense of purpose. The man Tengo saw before him was nothing but an empty shell.\\n\\n\\u201cMr. Kawana!\\u201d the nurse said to Tengo\\u2019s father in the crisp, clear tone she must have been trained to use when addressing patients. \\u201cMr. Kawana! Look who\\u2019s here! It\\u2019s your son, here from Tokyo!\\u201d\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father turned in his direction. His expressionless eyes made Tengo think of two empty swallow\\u2019s nests hanging from the eaves.\\n\\n\\u201cHello,\\u201d Tengo said.\\n\\nHis father said nothing. Instead, he looked straight at Tengo as if he were reading a bulletin written in a foreign language.\\n\\n\\u201cDinner starts at six-thirty,\\u201d the nurse said to Tengo. \\u201cPlease feel free to stay until then.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo hesitated for a moment after the nurse left, and then approached his father, sitting down in the chair opposite his\\u2014a faded, cloth-covered chair, its wooden parts scarred from long use. His father\\u2019s eyes followed his movements.\\n\\n\\u201cHow are you?\\u201d Tengo asked.\\n\\n\\u201cFine, thank you,\\u201d his father said formally.\\n\\nTengo did not know what to say after that. Toying with the third button of his dungaree shirt, he turned his gaze toward the pine trees outside and then back again to his father.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have come from Tokyo, is it?\\u201d his father asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, from Tokyo.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou must have come by express train.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s right,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cAs far as Tateyama. Then I transferred to a local for the trip here to Chikura.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019ve come to swim?\\u201d his father asked.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m Tengo. Tengo Kawana. Your son.\\u201d\\n\\nThe wrinkles in his father\\u2019s forehead deepened. \\u201cA lot of people tell lies because they don\\u2019t want to pay their NHK subscription fee.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFather!\\u201d Tengo called out to him. He had not spoken the word in a very long time. \\u201cI\\u2019m Tengo. Your son.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t have a son,\\u201d his father declared.\\n\\n\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have a son,\\u201d Tengo repeated mechanically.\\n\\nHis father nodded.\\n\\n\\u201cSo what am I?\\u201d Tengo asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re nothing,\\u201d his father said with two short shakes of the head.\\n\\nTengo caught his breath. He could find no words. Nor did his father have any more to say. Each sat in silence, searching through his own tangled thoughts. Only the cicadas sang without confusion, at top volume.\\n\\nHe may be speaking the truth, Tengo thought. His memory may have been destroyed, but his words are probably true.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d Tengo asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYou are nothing,\\u201d his father repeated, his voice devoid of emotion. \\u201cYou were nothing, you are nothing, and you will be nothing.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo wanted to get up from his chair, walk to the station, and go back to Tokyo then and there. But he could not stand up. He was like the young man who travelled to the town of cats. He had curiosity. He wanted a clearer answer. There was danger lurking, of course. But if he let this opportunity escape he would have no chance to learn the secret about himself. Tengo arranged and rearranged words in his head until at last he was ready to speak them. This was the question he had wanted to ask since childhood but could never quite manage to get out: \\u201cWhat you\\u2019re saying, then, is that you are not my biological father, correct? You are telling me that there is no blood connection between us, is that it?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStealing radio waves is an unlawful act,\\u201d his father said, looking into Tengo\\u2019s eyes. \\u201cIt is no different from stealing money or valuables, don\\u2019t you think?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re probably right.\\u201d Tengo decided to agree for now.\\n\\n\\u201cRadio waves don\\u2019t come falling out of the sky for free like rain or snow,\\u201d his father said.\\n\\nTengo stared at his father\\u2019s hands. They were lined up neatly on his knees. Small, dark hands, they looked tanned to the bone by long years of outdoor work.\\n\\n\\u201cMy mother didn\\u2019t really die of an illness when I was little, did she?\\u201d Tengo asked slowly.\\n\\nHis father did not answer. His expression did not change, and his hands did not move. His eyes focussed on Tengo as if they were observing something unfamiliar.\\n\\n\\u201cMy mother left you. She left you and me behind. She went off with another man. Am I wrong?\\u201d\\n\\nHis father nodded. \\u201cIt is not good to steal radio waves. You can\\u2019t get away with it, just doing whatever you want.\\u201d\\n\\nThis man understands my questions perfectly well. He just doesn\\u2019t want to answer them directly, Tengo thought.\\n\\n\\u201cFather,\\u201d Tengo addressed him. \\u201cYou may not actually be my father, but I\\u2019ll call you that for now because I don\\u2019t know what else to call you. To tell you the truth, I\\u2019ve never liked you. Maybe I\\u2019ve even hated you most of the time. You know that, don\\u2019t you? But, even supposing that there is no blood connection between us, I no longer have any reason to hate you. I don\\u2019t know if I can go so far as to be fond of you, but I think that at least I should be able to understand you better than I do now. I have always wanted to know the truth about who I am and where I came from. That\\u2019s all. If you will tell me the truth here and now, I won\\u2019t hate you anymore. In fact, I would welcome the opportunity not to have to hate you any longer.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo\\u2019s father went on staring at him with expressionless eyes, but Tengo felt that he might be seeing the tiniest gleam of light somewhere deep within those empty swallow\\u2019s nests.\\n\\n\\u201cI am nothing,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cYou are right. I\\u2019m like someone who\\u2019s been thrown into the ocean at night, floating all alone. I reach out, but no one is there. I have no connection to anything. The closest thing I have to a family is you, but you hold on to the secret. Meanwhile, your memory deteriorates day by day. Along with your memory, the truth about me is being lost. Without the aid of truth, I am nothing, and I can never be anything. You are right about that, too.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKnowledge is a precious social asset,\\u201d his father said in a monotone, though his voice was somewhat quieter than before, as if someone had reached over and turned down the volume. \\u201cIt is an asset that must be amassed in abundant stockpiles and utilized with the utmost care. It must be handed down to the next generation in fruitful forms. For that reason, too, NHK needs to have all your subscription fees and\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nHe cut his father short. \\u201cWhat kind of person was my mother? Where did she go? What happened to her?\\u201d\\n\\nHis father brought his incantation to a halt, his lips shut tight.\\n\\nHis voice softer now, Tengo went on, \\u201cA vision often comes to me\\u2014the same one, over and over. I suspect it\\u2019s not so much a vision as a memory of something that actually happened. I\\u2019m one and a half years old, and my mother is next to me. She and a young man are holding each other. The man is not you. Who he is I have no idea, but he is definitely not you.\\u201d\\n\\nHis father said nothing, but his eyes were clearly seeing something else\\u2014something not there.\\n\\n\\u201cI wonder if I might ask you to read me something,\\u201d Tengo\\u2019s father said in formal tones after a long pause. \\u201cMy eyesight has deteriorated to the point where I can\\u2019t read books anymore. That bookcase has some books. Choose any one you like.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo got up to scan the spines of the volumes in the bookcase. Most of them were historical novels set in ancient times when samurai roamed the land. Tengo couldn\\u2019t bring himself to read his father some musty old book full of archaic language.\\n\\n\\u201cIf you don\\u2019t mind, I\\u2019d rather read a story about a town of cats,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s in a book that I brought to read myself.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cA story about a town of cats,\\u201d his father said, savoring the words. \\u201cPlease read that to me, if it is not too much trouble.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo looked at his watch. \\u201cIt\\u2019s no trouble at all. I have plenty of time before my train leaves. It\\u2019s an odd story. I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ll like it.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo pulled out his paperback and started reading slowly, in a clear, audible voice, taking two or three breaks along the way to catch his breath. He glanced at his father whenever he stopped reading but saw no discernible reaction on his face. Was he enjoying the story? He could not tell.\\n\\n\\u201cDoes that town of cats have television?\\u201d his father asked when Tengo had finished.\\n\\n\\u201cThe story was written in Germany in the nineteen-thirties. They didn\\u2019t have television yet back then. They did have radio, though.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDid the cats build the town? Or did people build it before the cats came to live there?\\u201d his father asked, speaking as if to himself.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cBut it does seem to have been built by human beings. Maybe the people left for some reason\\u2014say, they all died in an epidemic of some sort\\u2014and the cats came to live there.\\u201d\\n\\nHis father nodded. \\u201cWhen a vacuum forms, something has to come along to fill it. That\\u2019s what everybody does.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s what everybody does?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cExactly.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat kind of vacuum are you filling?\\u201d\\n\\nHis father scowled. Then he said with a touch of sarcasm in his voice, \\u201cDon\\u2019t you know?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Tengo said.\\n\\nHis father\\u2019s nostrils flared. One eyebrow rose slightly. \\u201cIf you can\\u2019t understand it without an explanation, you can\\u2019t understand it with an explanation.\\u201d\\n\\nTengo narrowed his eyes, trying to read the man\\u2019s expression. Never once had his father employed such odd, suggestive language. He always spoke in concrete, practical terms.\\n\\n\\u201cI see. So you are filling some kind of vacuum,\\u201d Tengo said. \\u201cAll right, then, who is going to fill the vacuum that you have left behind?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou,\\u201d his father declared, raising an index finger and thrusting it straight at Tengo. \\u201cIsn\\u2019t it obvious? I have been filling the vacuum that somebody else made, so you will fill the vacuum that I have made.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe way the cats filled the town after the people were gone.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cRight,\\u201d his father said. Then he stared vacantly at his own outstretched index finger as if at some mysterious, misplaced object.\\n\\nTengo sighed. \\u201cSo, then, who is my father?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJust a vacuum. Your mother joined her body with a vacuum and gave birth to you. I filled that vacuum.\\u201d\\n\\nHaving said that much, his father closed his eyes and closed his mouth.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd you raised me after she left. Is that what you\\u2019re saying?\\u201d\\n\\nAfter a ceremonious clearing of his throat, his father said, as if trying to explain a simple truth to a slow-witted child, \\u201cThat is why I said, \\u2018If you can\\u2019t understand it without an explanation, you can\\u2019t understand it with an explanation.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nTengo folded his hands in his lap and looked straight into his father\\u2019s face. This man is no empty shell, he thought. He is a flesh-and-blood human being with a narrow, stubborn soul, surviving in fits and starts on this patch of land by the sea. He has no choice but to coexist with the vacuum that is slowly spreading inside him. Eventually, that vacuum will swallow up whatever memories are left. It is only a matter of time.\\n\\nTengo said goodbye to his father just before 6 P.M. While he waited for the taxi to come, they sat across from each other by the window, saying nothing. Tengo had many more questions he wanted to ask, but he knew that he would get no answers. The sight of his father\\u2019s tightly clenched lips told him that. If you couldn\\u2019t understand something without an explanation, you couldn\\u2019t understand it with an explanation. As his father had said.\\n\\nWhen the time for him to leave drew near, Tengo said, \\u201cYou told me a lot today. It was indirect and often hard to grasp, but it was probably as honest and open as you could make it. I should be grateful for that.\\u201d\\n\\nStill his father said nothing, his eyes fixed on the view like a soldier on guard duty, determined not to miss the signal flare sent up by a savage tribe on a distant hill. Tengo tried looking out along his father\\u2019s line of vision, but all that was out there was the pine grove, tinted by the coming sunset.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to say it, but there is virtually nothing I can do for you\\u2014other than to hope that the process forming a vacuum inside you is a painless one. I\\u2019m sure you have suffered a lot. You loved my mother as deeply as you knew how. I do get that sense. But she left, and that must have been hard on you\\u2014like living in an empty town. Still, you raised me in that empty town.\\u201d\\n\\nA pack of crows cut across the sky, cawing. Tengo stood up, went over to his father, and put his hand on his shoulder. \\u201cGoodbye, Father. I\\u2019ll come again soon.\\u201d\\n\\nWith his hand on the doorknob, Tengo turned around one last time and was shocked to see a single tear escaping his father\\u2019s eye. It shone a dull silver color under the ceiling\\u2019s fluorescent light. The tear crept slowly down his cheek and fell onto his lap. Tengo opened the door and left the room. He took a cab to the station and reboarded the train that had brought him here.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Tengo, feeling aimless and with no plans for the day, boards a train to Chikura to visit his father, who is in a sanatorium for patients with cognitive disorders.

The husband\\u2019s daughter came to lunch, too. She was the youngest of his three children, and she had recently walked the Appalachian Trail, all of it, from Maine to Georgia. Now she was moving to Wyoming to work on a cattle ranch. Her father didn\\u2019t mind this, but her mother, her grandparents, and even some of her friends objected strongly. The girl didn\\u2019t seem to care. She said that at first she had cared but then she saw that they were only jealous of her willingness to do what she wanted, free of expectations, and then she didn\\u2019t care anymore. She was twenty-one.\\n\\nHe thought of himself at twenty-one. Where had he been? He had been in college. Then he had graduated and begun to work, at a drug clinic. In the summer between college and working he went to study Italian at an immersion program in Vermont, but he was lonely and intimidated, and he left after three days. He thought of his wife\\u2019s sister\\u2019s husband\\u2019s daughter\\u2019s decision not to care what people thought of her. She had described it as a sort of switch: first she had cared, then she had not cared. The switch was her will. He could not remember ever applying his will to such drastic effect, particularly about other people and their feelings about him. This, he decided, was the essence of her courage and of his cowardice.\\n\\nThat night, while undressing, he tried to explain all this to his wife. She understood him immediately, but she raised a number of objections and mitigating forces.\\n\\n1.) The girl was overstating or misrepresenting her experience. She very likely did care what other people thought of her\\u2014especially her mother\\u2014and was portraying her transformation as stark only because it was a) more dramatic to speak that way, b) more self-aggrandizing to speak that way, and c) a means of convincing herself of her own courage, without which she would not be able to do what she was doing.\\n\\n2.) The girl was not known, given the stories her sister told about her, to be especially generous or compassionate, whereas by all reports he always had been, and these qualities\\u2014generosity and compassion\\u2014entailed their own form of courage: the courage to serve others. (At this he winced.)\\n\\n3.) At the time he had grown anxious and homesick and left the language school, his mother had been deathly ill, a detail that ought to soften his judgment of himself. It was important to consider context.\\n\\nHe thanked her, this woman who loved him and who didn\\u2019t judge him for those parts of himself that most troubled and shamed him, but he offered counterarguments to which he believed she would have no effective response.\\n\\n1.) Even if the girl was misrepresenting herself in order to bolster her spirits, this was, as he saw it, further evidence of her courage\\u2014courage consisting, as everyone knew, not of action in the absence of objections but action in the face of them.\\n\\n2.) Selfishness was its own form of courage, and in fact was, within reason, exactly the kind of courage that he had in mind.\\n\\n3.) Many people had mothers who were dying and then died.

Would she cook and clean? He had meant to ask her but then the conversation had turned. Was she frightened at all? Did she have reservations? What resources of mind or spirit did she think she possessed to move to a place two thousand miles from her family, a place in which she knew nobody and the terrain and climate were utterly different from those which she had always known?

The daughter, unlike the protagonist, is fearless and cares little about what others think of her.\\n\\nReflecting on his own life at the age of twenty-one, the protagonist realizes that he has never exerted his will to the same extent as the daughter when it comes to defying societal expectations.

Additionally, the protagonist's wife points out that he possesses other forms of courage, such as generosity and compassion.\\n\\nThe protagonist, however, continues to believe that the daughter's ability to disregard others' opinions is a display of true bravery. He counters his wife's arguments by asserting that misrepresentation can still indicate courage, and that selfishness, within reasonable bounds, can also be a form of bravery. Despite his wife's objections, the protagonist remains fixated on the daughter's decision and wonders about her future on the ranch.

It was like this. I was staying at a cabin with my husband\\u2019s family over the Christmas break. This large dog, maybe two hundred and fifty pounds, came to the back door. He didn\\u2019t bark\\u2014he looked in through the glass pane and waited patiently. My father-in-law, who, as a child, had shared a home with a deer and a flying squirrel, opened the door.\\n\\nThat giant mountain dog came up the steps, crossed the room, and greeted me with a gentle head push. He put his nose down between his front paws, to make himself lower than me. He wagged his tail, gently. He had chosen me. He visited every day that week, for an hour or two in the morning, an hour or two in the afternoon, following me all around the house and out into the yard, too. I get along with dogs fine, generally, but this was something else. We loved each other. His nametag read \\u201cKush.\\u201d To the rest of the family, he was merely polite. I don\\u2019t know how to explain it, but my father\\u2019s spirit was in that dog. Yes, my father had also been giant, and gentle, but it was more than that. My father was paying me a visit. It was strange, but also obvious. This was some fifteen years ago. In the year or so after the encounter, it seemed like I was meeting Bernese mountain dogs in elevators and on sidewalks all the time, but, when I met Kush, who was also my father, he was the first Bernese mountain dog I\\u2019d ever seen.\\n\\nWhere were all those dogs now? The breed had surged in popularity, then, it seemed, vanished.\\n\\nI met the next ghost at a book-club meeting at the Boulder Public Library. I didn\\u2019t live in Boulder, I was passing through, but there was a notice in the newspaper about the book club, and my husband and I thought it sounded fun. I was a better person when I was young, and more open. The book club was reading \\u201cThe Overcoat,\\u201d by Nikolai Gogol. Poor Akaky Akakievich spends all his savings on a new overcoat; the coat is stolen; after a series of further humiliations, trying to reclaim the coat, he dies of a fever; there are reports of his ghost haunting St. Petersburg, stealing coats from others.\\n\\nIt was a mixed crowd at the book club. Was the story about bureaucracy? About human vanity? About folklore? Was it a satire, or a tragedy, etc. It was the usual discussion. But then a small, thin man sitting in the corner scolded us all for missing the point. \\u201cGhosts are real,\\u201d he said. The story was about a real ghost and \\u201cnone of you understand that.\\u201d The thin man said that he knew that ghosts were real because for years he had worked at a slaughterhouse in Broomfield.\\n\\nThe man\\u2019s comments were received politely, but he left the meeting frustrated. Upon reflection, it was clear, to me and my husband, that the man from Broomfield was himself a ghost. That was what he was trying to say.\\n\\nThe last ghost was a mom I knew only a little bit, from my youth. Her husband was a professional trumpeter. I babysat for her two boys a few times. The last time I did so, they were so out of control when their parents came home that I was never asked back again\\u2014which I thought was reasonable. Later, two very sad things happened in that family: one of the boys died in a car accident, and the mom had a seizure in the night and was found to have a brain tumor. By that time, I lived in a city thousands of miles away and hadn\\u2019t seen the family in years. But one night, more than a year after I learned of the tumor, I had a very vivid dream with Leona in it\\u2014Leona was the mom\\u2019s name\\u2014and we said hello and were very happy to see each other. Really happy. The next day my own mom called me to tell me that Leona had died. I\\u2019d never had a dream with Leona in it before, and I never had another one after.\\n\\nI told my daughter about the ghosts, because I wanted to be honest with her. Ghosts aren\\u2019t real, but also they are? Or something like that. I don\\u2019t know what I wanted to communicate to her. Probably I was showing off. I said three ghosts. But wasn\\u2019t that misleading? I had spent so many years interested in ghosts, the dead, ancestors I\\u2019d never met, anything sad and gone\\u2014that world felt real to me. But I haven\\u2019t seen a single ghost in more than ten years. Wait, no, I fixed the math. I hadn\\u2019t seen one in . . . the number of years was the age of my daughter.

What with lending salt or borrowing salad dressing, we got to be friends, and soon we were at each other\\u2019s places all the time, listening to records, drinking beer. Once, my girlfriend and I drove out to the Kamakura shore with Q and his girlfriend. We were very comfortable together. Then, during the summer break of my senior year, I moved out, and that was that.\\n\\nThe next time I saw Q, almost a decade had gone by. I was reading a book by a swanky hotel pool near the Akasaka district. Q was sitting in the deck chair next to mine, and beside him was a beautiful long-legged woman in a bikini.\\n\\nI knew right away that it was Q. He was as handsome as ever, and now, just over thirty, he evinced a certain dignity that he hadn\\u2019t had before. Young women walking by gave him a quick once-over.\\n\\nHe didn\\u2019t notice me sitting next to him. I\\u2019m a fairly ordinary-looking guy, and I was wearing sunglasses. I wasn\\u2019t sure whether I should talk to him, but in the end I decided not to. He and the woman were deep in conversation, and I hesitated to interrupt them. Besides, there wasn\\u2019t a lot that he and I could have talked about. \\u201cI lent you salt, remember?\\u201d \\u201cHey, that\\u2019s right, and I borrowed a bottle of salad dressing.\\u201d We would have run out of topics quickly. So I kept my mouth shut and stuck to my book.\\n\\nStill, I couldn\\u2019t help overhearing what Q and his pretty companion were saying to each other. It was a fairly complicated matter. I gave up trying to read and listened to them.\\n\\n\\u201cNo way,\\u201d the woman said. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to be kidding.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI know, I know,\\u201d Q said. \\u201cI know exactly what you\\u2019re saying. But you\\u2019ve got to see it my way, too. I\\u2019m not doing this because I want to. It was the guys upstairs. I\\u2019m just telling you what they decided. So don\\u2019t look at me that way.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, right,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nQ let out a sigh.\\n\\nLet me summarize their long conversation\\u2014filling in a good deal by way of imagination, of course. Q seemed to be now a director at a TV station or some such place, and the woman was a moderately well-known singer or actress. She was being let go from a project because of some sort of trouble or scandal she had become involved in, or maybe just because her popularity had declined. The job of informing her had been left to Q, who was the person most directly responsible for day-to-day operations. I don\\u2019t know much about the entertainment industry, so I can\\u2019t be sure of the finer points, but I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019m too far off over all.\\n\\nJudging from what I heard, Q was discharging his duty with genuine sincerity.\\n\\n\\u201cWe can\\u2019t survive without sponsors,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t have to tell you that\\u2014you know the business.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSo you\\u2019re telling me that you don\\u2019t have any responsibility or say in the matter?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, I\\u2019m not telling you that. But what I can do is really limited.\\u201d\\n\\nTheir conversation took another turn into a dead-end street. She wanted to know just how much he had exerted himself on her behalf. He insisted that he had done everything he could, but he had no way to prove it, and she didn\\u2019t believe him. I didn\\u2019t really believe him, either. The more sincerely he tried to explain things, the more a fog of insincerity came to hang over everything. But it wasn\\u2019t Q\\u2019s fault. It wasn\\u2019t anybody\\u2019s fault. Which was why there was no way out of this conversation.\\n\\nIt appeared that the woman had always liked Q. I sensed that they had got along well until this business came up. Which probably only added to the woman\\u2019s anger. In the end, though, she was the one who gave in.\\n\\n\\u201cO.K.,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve had it. Buy me a Coke, will you?\\u201d\\n\\nWhen he heard that, Q breathed a sigh of relief and went off to the drink stand. The woman put on her sunglasses and stared straight ahead. By this time, I had read the same line in my book a couple hundred times.\\n\\nSoon, Q came back with two big paper cups. Handing one to the woman, he lowered himself into his deck chair. \\u201cDon\\u2019t get too depressed about this,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAny day now you\\u2019ll\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nBut, before he could finish, the woman threw her full cup at him. It caught him square in the face, and about a third of the Coca-Cola splashed onto me. Without a word, the woman stood up and, giving a little yank at the seat of her bikini, strode off without a backward glance. Q and I just sat there stunned for a good fifteen seconds. The people nearby were staring at us in shock.\\n\\nQ was the first to regain his composure. \\u201cSorry,\\u201d he said and held a towel out to me.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s O.K.,\\u201d I answered. \\u201cI\\u2019ll just take a shower.\\u201d\\n\\nLooking slightly annoyed, he drew the towel back and used it to dry himself.\\n\\n\\u201cAt least let me pay for the book,\\u201d he said. It was true that my book was soaked. But it was just a cheap paperback, and not a very interesting one at that. Anyone who threw a Coke on it and prevented me from reading it was doing me a favor. He brightened up when I said that. He had the same great smile as always.\\n\\nQ left at that point, apologizing to me once more as he stood to go. He had never realized who I was.\\n\\nI decided to give this story the title \\u201cThe Kingdom That Failed\\u201d because I happened to read an article in the evening paper that day about an African kingdom that had failed. \\u201cTo see a splendid kingdom fade away,\\u201d it said, \\u201cis far sadder than seeing a second-rate republic collapse.\\u201d\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story begins with the narrator describing a river behind a failed kingdom.

I met her in an Ibsen module at Copenhagen University. She always sat in the front row and spent the hour diligently taking notes, or giving answers before anyone else could during the tutorial sessions. I, too, knew the answers but I didn\\u2019t say them out loud; instead, I waited for someone else to speak. More often than not, she was that person. When she spoke, her \\u201ce,\\u201d \\u201ca,\\u201d and \\u201c\\u00e6\\u201d vowels were a little too crisp, a little too clean-sounding, like the rigsdansk of some bygone TV presenter.\\n\\nWe were the only Asians, two dark spots among the bright blond heads of varying shades, and I wondered if she had also been adopted by Danish parents, as was the case with many Asians in Denmark, brought up to think of themselves as Danish. The only thing Asian about us was our birth, and, of course, our appearance. Over the years, I had met a number of others like me: the first when I was fourteen, during a class trip to Paris; the second in my first year of university; another was presented to me at a Friday bar by a mutual friend; and a fourth, an adoptee from Norway, had been a kollegium floor-mate. Mette Honor\\u00e9, Helle Nielsen, Mia Kj\\u00e6rsgaard, Unn Fahlstr\\u00f8m. With each, things had never gone beyond the initial conversation, an exchange of backgrounds. I hadn\\u2019t given any of them much thought since our respective encounters, but I didn\\u2019t forget their names, which all belonged to Korean-born Scandinavian girls.\\n\\nAt first glance, Ditte seemed to fit the same mold. On the last day of class, I found her waiting for me in the corridor outside the auditorium. Up to then, she had behaved as if I wasn\\u2019t there, though she must have noticed me the same way I had noticed her. In the tone of someone who has rehearsed her words beforehand, she asked me if I wanted to get a beer at the cafeteria. As we walked in silence, I thought I knew what was coming. After all, I had been through this before with other adoptees. Like them, she was surprised when I told her that I had been born in Japan, not Korea. I wasn\\u2019t her first adoptee, but the ones she had met thus far had been girls. I was, in a manner of speaking, her first boy. I learned that we had arrived in Denmark at the ages of five months and six months, respectively. We were both a year younger than our fellow-students, who had, in the Danish tradition, taken a sabbatical year to work or travel.\\n\\nWas she really all that different from the other Korean girls I had met? That was what I found myself thinking, during our third outing, as I glanced at her shadowy profile next to me in the darkness of a cinema at Scala. Now I wonder if it wasn\\u2019t so much Ditte herself as how alike I thought we were that drew me to her. (Or perhaps that is the essence of attraction: a longing to see something of oneself in another.) Like looking into an enchanted mirror: when I looked at her, I saw a Dane who looked like me. I remember, one night, we lay face to face and gazed wordlessly into each other\\u2019s eyes until Ditte broke the spell by bursting into laughter. In bed, she was very clear about what she wanted, what she didn\\u2019t want, how she felt, and how she wanted to feel, demonstrating the same thoroughness she had shown in the classroom. Her scent, the consistency of her hair, the color of her nipples\\u2014everything about her was at once strange and familiar. When she told me that she had never used deodorant because she didn\\u2019t have to, I knew exactly what she was talking about. I had never bought a stick of deodorant in my life, though I had carried one around and even pretended to use it all through my upper-secondary years, so that I wouldn\\u2019t stand out among the other kids at my boarding school. A look of recognition seemed to dawn in her gaze when I told her about my constant need to prove myself when meeting new people. In retrospect, I\\u2019m not sure what these shared moments of understanding and complicity meant to her. Did they mean anything at all?\\n\\nWe were together for almost four months, during which time we explored Copenhagen as if for the first time, with new eyes. I had never noticed all the busts, bas-reliefs and other three-dimensional representations scattered throughout the city, which we baptized \\u201cthe city of statues\\u201d because the statues outnumbered the inhabitants, joked Ditte. She had grown up in Esbjerg, in West Jutland, and spent part of every summer on Fan\\u00f8, where her parents had a summer home overlooking the Wadden Sea. I had grown up in the Whiskey Belt, just north of Copenhagen, my summers punctuated by fishing trips with my father to the Faroe Islands. She loved salted black licorice, the typical Scandinavian kind. Before bed, I used to steal mine from the cabinet where my mother kept it in a glass jar shaped like a Swedish Dalecarlian horse. We both loved having \\u00f8llebr\\u00f8d for breakfast; observing the sky on bright summer nights when dusk seems to go on forever; watching old Danish television dramas like \\u201cJeg kan ikke vente til mandag!\\u201d and \\u201cOlive og Tom.\\u201d\\n\\nPerhaps a part of me already knew it couldn\\u2019t last, the theory of compatibility that I had constructed like scaffolding around us, and whose fragile symmetry I marvelled at in secret. We were too alike, I remember thinking; it wasn\\u2019t normal to be this close to someone in so short a time, like skipping to the end of a book one has been reading too fast from the start. But the mirror at last reflected someone back at me. Around that time, I had a strange dream. In it, Ditte was my sister, the two of us separated at birth, and, although I knew such a thing to be impossible\\u2014my blood was Japanese, hers was Korean, after all\\u2014I woke in the dark with an erection, my heart beating like a tam-tam. I was alone in my bed; Ditte had gone back to her hall of residence at some point during the night without waking me. When we saw each other again, I made the mistake of telling her about my dream. Though I had left out the part about my erection, bewilderment and disgust clouded her face, as if I had laid bare some unspeakable fantasy. She asked me if that was how I had always seen her. The thought of an incestuous relationship with a long-lost sister had never crossed my mind, I said, but Ditte refused to believe me.\\n\\nThings were never the same after that. One day, she informed me of her intention to spend the weekend in Esbjerg, where her parents still lived. We had often talked about going together, but the trip had never materialized. The following night, I received a phone call; in the background I heard voices, music, as though she had called me from a party. She seemed distracted or irritated by something. We ended the conversation without saying goodbye. I eventually learned that she had left me for her thesis supervisor, who also happened to be my thesis supervisor. After that, I couldn\\u2019t walk past certain places\\u2014the statue of Adam Oehlenschl\\u00e4ger near the zoo in Norske All\\u00e9, the skating rink in N\\u00f8rrebro Park, even the oil tanks at Pr\\u00f8vestenen\\u2014without being reminded of her. The worst was going to see my thesis supervisor. I couldn\\u2019t be sure, but it seemed that the man had no idea about me and Ditte. He was out of shape, dark-haired (for a blond Dane), and his chin receded a bit. Other than his vast and bottomless intelligence, his daggerlike wit, his impressive list of publications, what could she possibly see in him? And that was when I realized that I had never really known her, any more than I had known the adopted Korean girls before her. She had become a name to add to the others. All this time, I had thought of her as a mirror, a strange and beguiling reflection, but it would seem that she had been drawn to me because I was different, a change from all the Danes she had previously dated.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The protagonist is a third-year student at Copenhagen University who feels unsure of himself and his place in the world.

For asthmatics, like Carl, black mold can be plain dangerous. Carl decontaminates the fridge. He holds his breath and sprays. I\\u2019m on the toilet, door open. That\\u2019s how well we know each other.\\n\\nCarl shares the apartment with a friend. Martin is hard to read. Smart, a slacker with tunnel vision. He wears a thick ring, inlaid with a ruby. The ruby looks like a blood blister. He doesn\\u2019t talk to me. Sometimes he grunts. I\\u2019m not sure if the sounds he makes have their own meaning, or if they are uttered out of pure necessity. Martin eats baby food out of glass jars. I hear the click when he opens a jar, a guarantee that its vacuum seal is intact. The baby food is the opposite of the black mold. Martin eats the baby food in bed and watches porn while wrapped in a blanket with a Betty Boop print. This is what he is: grunt, click, baby food, click, porn, click. With a future as a banker and a high-income individual, click. I can\\u2019t imagine him being able to get hard, jerk off, come. It\\u2019s as if growing or shrinking didn\\u2019t exist for him.\\n\\nWhen Martin drags himself to lectures, I borrow his porn mags, which he keeps in a rattan magazine stand that may once have held yarn or knitting patterns.

She braids her hair and makes side buns. She wears dresses with puffed sleeves and lacing at the waist. Is this a form of irony? When I comment on the cross-stitching with a polite enthusiasm, she points out that it references a type of folklore. The dress was sewn and embroidered by a Polish Jewish aunt on her mother\\u2019s side. She talks endlessly about her family. It turns out that she and Carl are related somehow. Lizzy is the chairperson of a comedic am-dram society. I can just picture her with a wine-red costume, a tall hat, drumsticks, maybe a drum, too. When she does let her hair down, it\\u2019s as if she were naked, horny, drunk, limitless. It\\u2019s as if she\\u2019d become the pornographic centerfold. Carl has sex with her without telling me.

He has a hunting license. When he sees me he delivers a slap that knocks me off my feet. He asks how dare I be here. Another Practical Pig, identically dressed but fat and maskless, comes charging. He pushes Carl and grabs me by the shoulders, gets covered in green paint. I cry a little. Not because this hurts. But because everything hurts. He takes me to his dorm, opens a can of mussels, fries rice. Hands me shower gel, two in one. When I am nice and clean I am given food and a robe. He plays Miles Davis on the grand piano in the living room. It\\u2019s morning, and the smell of cardamom drifts over from the bakery opposite.

I noticed them as I stepped out of a medical building. I noticed them because everything else in my peripheral vision shifted but they did not. The wind was blowing the leaves, the leaves were dying and leaping, and the couple was so still. The couple was unmoving. I was, too, looking at them. So it was the three of us as everything else moved, constant and full and wide. People brushed by our shoulders, sweeping our sides as they strode toward their destinations. People were busy. People didn\\u2019t care about the couple standing in the middle of the uneven sidewalk. People stirred around them like the sea, splashing against their ankles.\\n\\nThe man held her arms, his manicured fingers grasping hard.\\n\\nNear the couple, there was a burned chair: garbage, darkened wood, charred remnants. That\\u2019s what had attracted my attention while I was leaving the building, the medical building, with the activated charcoal in my teeth\\u2014an abandoned chair all broken at the hips.\\n\\nI imagined the impulse of someone purchasing a new chair, deciding to throw this old one away\\u2014picking it up with their knees bent and their lower back engaged, a contraction in the abdomen, separating it from their other possessions, and this object (made only for laziness or rest or gathering) being moved down a flight of wooden steps, being carried and offered to this sidewalk, sloppily, an old chair left to perish, and I imagined, too, the person who might have burned it, probably a man (men expect things to have violent ends) with a lighter or a match and the smell of a cigarette on his thumbs.\\n\\nThe dead chair was near the unmoving couple.\\n\\nThere was a balance there that I found significant, so I looked back and forth between them for six minutes, or seven.

It also highlights the importance of objects and their ability to evoke emotions and memories. The friendship between Ilka and Bridget serves as a lens through which these themes are explored and understood.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"The story is a conversation between two old friends, Ilka and Bridget, as they walk together on Riverside Drive. Ilka recalls a past incident from her childhood and worries about her ability to remember certain words or details. She describes receiving a tortoise as a birthday present, named Kr\\u00f6terl, during the week of Hitler's takeover in Vienna. She remembers that the tortoise didn't move until her mother put it in warm water, at which point it began to march around the tub. The next day, their apartment was taken away by three Brown Shirts and they were forced to find alternative places to stay.\\n\\nBridget, who is empathetic due to her own troubling experiences in the past, asks if Ilka took the tortoise with her when they had to leave their apartment. However, Ilka's memory becomes focused on random details, such as her father sharpening his razor and the spooky feeling of using the bathroom in the dark. She tells Bridget that she doesn't remember what happened to the tortoise after they left the apartment as her mind is consumed by memories and emotions from that time.\\n\\nBridget ponders the idea of being without a roof, both literally and metaphorically, and how it connects to Ilka's situation of losing their apartment. Towards the end of the conversation, Ilka recalls that she got her children a stuffed toy version of a Kr\\u00f6terl and mentions that her email address includes the name.\\n\\nThe story suggests a connection between Ilka's fear of forgetting details and events from her past, and her attempt to immortalize those memories through her email address. Despite the loss and displacement she experiences, her connection to the Kr\\u00f6terl serves as a poignant reminder of her past, her nostalgia for Vienna, and highlights the complexities and importance of memory.\", \"story_token_count\": 1237, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 438, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 425}, {\"Title\": \"Symbols and Signs\", \"Author\": \"Vladimir Nabokov\", \"story\": \"For the fourth time in as many years, they were confronted with the problem of what birthday present to take to a young man who was incurably deranged in his mind. Desires he had none. Man-made objects were to him either hives of evil, vibrant with a malignant activity that he alone could perceive, or gross comforts for which no use could be found in his abstract world. After eliminating a number of articles that might offend him or frighten him (anything in the gadget line, for instance, was taboo), his parents chose a dainty and innocent trifle\\u2014a basket with ten different fruit jellies in ten little jars.\\n\\nAt the time of his birth, they had already been married for a long time; a score of years had elapsed, and now they were quite old. Her drab gray hair was pinned up carelessly. She wore cheap black dresses. Unlike other women of her age (such as Mrs. Sol, their next-door neighbor, whose face was all pink and mauve with paint and whose hat was a cluster of brookside flowers), she presented a naked white countenance to the faultfinding light of spring. Her husband, who in the old country had been a fairly successful businessman, was now, in New York, wholly dependent on his brother Isaac, a real American of almost forty years\\u2019 standing. They seldom saw Isaac and had nicknamed him the Prince.\\n\\nThat Friday, their son\\u2019s birthday, everything went wrong. The subway train lost its life current between two stations and for a quarter of an hour they could hear nothing but the dutiful beating of their hearts and the rustling of newspapers. The bus they had to take next was late and kept them waiting a long time on a street corner, and when it did come, it was crammed with garrulous high-school children. It began to rain as they walked up the brown path leading to the sanitarium. There they waited again, and instead of their boy, shuffling into the room, as he usually did (his poor face sullen, confused, ill-shaven, and blotched with acne), a nurse they knew and did not care for appeared at last and brightly explained that he had again attempted to take his life. He was all right, she said, but a visit from his parents might disturb him. The place was so miserably understaffed, and things got mislaid or mixed up so easily, that they decided not to leave their present in the office but to bring it to him next time they came.\\n\\nOutside the building, she waited for her husband to open his umbrella and then took his arm. He kept clearing his throat, as he always did when he was upset. They reached the bus-stop shelter on the other side of the street and he closed his umbrella. A few feet away, under a swaying and dripping tree, a tiny unfledged bird was helplessly twitching in a puddle.\\n\\nDuring the long ride to the subway station, she and her husband did not exchange a word, and every time she glanced at his old hands, clasped and twitching upon the handle of his umbrella, and saw their swollen veins and brown-spotted skin, she felt the mounting pressure of tears. As she looked around, trying to hook her mind onto something, it gave her a kind of soft shock, a mixture of compassion and wonder, to notice that one of the passengers\\u2014a girl with dark hair and grubby red toenails\\u2014was weeping on the shoulder of an older woman. Whom did that woman resemble? She resembled Rebecca Borisovna, whose daughter had married one of the Soloveichiks\\u2014in Minsk, years ago.\\n\\nThe last time the boy had tried to do it, his method had been, in the doctor\\u2019s words, a masterpiece of inventiveness; he would have succeeded had not an envious fellow-patient thought he was learning to fly and stopped him just in time. What he had really wanted to do was to tear a hole in his world and escape.\\n\\nThe system of his delusions had been the subject of an elaborate paper in a scientific monthly, which the doctor at the sanitarium had given to them to read. But long before that, she and her husband had puzzled it out for themselves. \\u201cReferential mania,\\u201d the article had called it. In these very rare cases, the patient imagines that everything happening around him is a veiled reference to his personality and existence. He excludes real people from the conspiracy, because he considers himself to be so much more intelligent than other men. Phenomenal nature shadows him wherever he goes. Clouds in the staring sky transmit to each other, by means of slow signs, incredibly detailed information regarding him. His in- most thoughts are discussed at nightfall, in manual alphabet, by darkly gesticulating trees. Pebbles or stains or sun flecks form patterns representing, in some awful way, messages that he must intercept. Everything is a cipher and of everything he is the theme. All around him, there are spies. Some of them are detached observers, like glass surfaces and still pools; others, such as coats in store windows, are prejudiced witnesses, lynchers at heart; others, again (running water, storms), are hysterical to the point of insanity, have a distorted opinion of him, and grotesquely misinterpret his actions. He must be always on his guard and devote every minute and module of life to the decoding of the undulation of things. The very air he exhales is indexed and filed away. If only the interest he provokes were limited to his immediate surroundings, but, alas, it is not! With distance, the torrents of wild scandal increase in volume and volubility. The silhouettes of his blood corpuscles, magnified a million times, flit over vast plains; and still farther away, great mountains of unbearable solidity and height sum up, in terms of granite and groaning firs, the ultimate truth of his being.\\n\\nWhen they emerged from the thunder and foul air of the subway, the last dregs of the day were mixed with the street lights. She wanted to buy some fish for supper, so she handed him the basket of jelly jars, telling him to go home. Accordingly, he returned to their tenement house, walked up to the third landing, and then remembered he had given her his keys earlier in the day.\\n\\nIn silence he sat down on the steps and in silence rose when, some ten minutes later, she came trudging heavily up the stairs, smiling wanly and shaking her head in deprecation of her silliness. They entered their two-room flat and he at once went to the mirror. Straining the corners of his mouth apart by means of his thumbs, with a horrible, mask-like grimace, he removed his new, hopelessly uncomfortable dental plate. He read his Russian-language newspaper while she laid the table. Still reading, he ate the pale victuals that needed no teeth. She knew his moods and was also silent.\\n\\nWhen he had gone to bed, she remained in the living room with her pack of soiled playing cards and her old photograph albums. Across the narrow courtyard, where the rain tinkled in the dark against some ash cans, windows were blandly alight, and in one of them a black-trousered man, with his hands clasped under his head and his elbows raised, could he seen lying supine on an untidy bed. She pulled the blind down and examined the photographs. As a baby, he looked more surprised than most babies. A photograph of a German maid they had had in Leipzig and her fat-faced fianc\\u00e9 fell out of a fold of the album. She turned the pages of the book: Minsk, the Revolution, Leipzig, Berlin, Leipzig again, a slanting house front, badly out of focus. Here was the boy when he was four years old, in a park, shyly, with puckered forehead, looking away from an eager squirrel, as he would have from any other stranger. Here was Aunt Rosa, a fussy, angular, wild-eyed old lady, who had lived in a tremulous world of bad news, bankruptcies, train accidents, and cancerous growths until the Germans put her to death, together with all the people she had worried about. The boy, aged six\\u2014that was when he drew wonderful birds with human hands and feet, and suffered from insomnia like a grown-up man. His cousin, now a famous chess player. The boy again, aged about eight, already hard to understand, afraid of the wallpaper in the passage, afraid of a certain picture in a book, which merely showed an idyllic landscape with rocks on a hillside and an old cart wheel hanging from the one branch of a leafless tree. Here he was at ten\\u2014the year they left Europe. She remembered the shame, the pity, the humiliating difficulties of the journey, and the ugly, vicious, backward children he was with in the special school where he had been placed after they arrived in America. And then came a time in his life, coinciding with a long convalescence after pneumonia, when those little phobias of his, which his parents had stubbornly regarded as the eccentricities of a prodigiously gifted child, hardened, as it were, into a dense tangle of logically interacting illusions, making them totally inaccessible to normal minds.\\n\\nAll this, and much more, she had accepted, for, after all, living does mean accepting the loss of one joy after another, not even joys in her case, mere possibilities of improvement. She thought of the recurrent waves of pain that for some reason or other she and her husband had had to endure; of the in visible giants hurting her boy in some unimaginable fashion; of the incalculable amount of tenderness contained in the world; of the fate of this tenderness, which is either crushed or wasted, or transformed into madness; of neglected children humming to themselves in unswept corners; of beautiful weeds that cannot hide from the farmer.\\n\\nIt was nearly midnight when, from the living room, she heard her husband moan, and presently he staggered in, wearing over his nightgown the old overcoat with the astrakhan collar that he much preferred to his nice blue bathrobe.\\n\\n\\u201cI can\\u2019t sleep!\\u201d he cried.\\n\\n\\u201cWhy can\\u2019t you sleep?\\u201d she asked. \\u201cYou were so tired.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI can\\u2019t sleep because I am dying,\\u201d he said, and lay down on the couch.\\n\\n\\u201cIs it your stomach? Do you want me to call Dr. Solov?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo doctors, no doctors,\\u201d he moaned. \\u201cTo the devil with doctors! We must get him out of there quick. Otherwise, we\\u2019ll be responsible.... Responsible!\\u201d He hurled himself into a sitting position, both feet on the floor, thumping his forehead with his clenched fist.\\n\\n\\u201cAll right,\\u201d she said quietly. \\u201cWe will bring him home tomorrow morning.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI would like some tea,\\u201d said her husband and went out to the bathroom.\\n\\nBending with difficulty, she retrieved some playing cards and a photograph or two that had slipped to the floor\\u2014the knave of hearts, the nine of spades, the ace of spades, the maid Elsa and her bestial beau. He returned in high spirits, saying in a loud voice, \\u201cI have it all figured out. We will give him the bedroom. Each of us will spend part of the night near him and the other part on this couch. We will have the doctor see him at least twice a week. It does not matter what the Prince says. He won\\u2019t have much to say anyway, because it will come out cheaper.\\u201d\\n\\nThe telephone rang. It was an unusual hour for it to ring. He stood in the middle of the room, groping with his foot for one slipper that had come off, and childishly, toothlessly, gaped at his wife. Since she knew more English than he, she always attended to the calls.\\n\\n\\u201dCan I speak to Charlie?\\u201d a girl\\u2019s dull little voice said to her now.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat number do you want? . . . No. You have the wrong number.\\u201d\\n\\nShe put the receiver down gently and her hand went to her heart. \\u201cIt frightened me,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nHe smiled a quick smile and immediately resumed his excited monologue. They would fetch him as soon as it was day. For his own protection, they would keep all the knives in a locked drawer. Even at his worst, he presented no danger to other people.\\n\\nThe telephone rang a second time.\\n\\nThe same toneless, anxious young voice asked for Charlie.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have the incorrect number. I will tell you what you are doing. You are turning the letter \\u2018o\\u2019 instead of the zero.\\u201d She hung up again.\\n\\nThey sat down to their unexpected, festive midnight tea. He sipped noisily; his face was flushed; every now and then he raised his glass with a circular motion, so as to make the sugar dissolve more thoroughly. The vein on the side of his bald head stood out conspicuously, and silvery bristles showed on his chin. The birthday present stood on the table. While she poured him another glass of tea, he put on his spectacles and re\\u00ebxamined with pleasure the luminous yellow, green, and red little jars. His clumsy, moist lips spelled out their eloquent labels\\u2014apricot, grape, beach plum, quince.

She sometimes said to him that the only time she felt a spark of desire was when they were out in the world, and they encountered an older couple taking care of their young grandchildren, children similar ages to their own. This became their private joke, which she didn\\u2019t repeat to others, knowing that others would most likely just find it inappropriate or sad. That\\u2019s my pornography, she would say. To watch an older man, relatively fit, at a kindergartener\\u2019s birthday party, just bending over and picking something up. Ooh, yeah, Grandpa, she would whisper privately to her spouse. That\\u2019s right. Pick up that empty juice box. Slowly, slowly. Yeah, put it in the garbage can. Ooh. That\\u2019s right. Do it. Do it. Sit in that chair. Get up from that chair. Oh, fuck, you can pick her up? Pick her up. Pick up that five-year-old body. And so on. The joke had an undercurrent of melancholy and exhaustion, like so much of what she was feeling lately. Her elderly father was alive, but he lived far away, or she lived far away from him, she imagined he\\u2019d say, and there was a division between them, even when he visited, which he hadn\\u2019t for a while, because of his failing health, and also because of what was going on in the world. When her father came to visit, he sat in a chair, which he didn\\u2019t do very well, as he often had to be helped out of it. He couldn\\u2019t stand for long periods of time, and, when she had given him the baby to hold, his first time meeting her, six months after she was born, he\\u2019d almost dropped her. Everyone she knew, it seemed, had parents who were often and actively present, who would come and stay for a while in a spare room\\u2014another miracle, the guest room\\u2014or who sometimes even moved in order to be closer to their children and their children\\u2019s children. They were present, for birthday parties, for trick-or-treating, even for dance classes, soccer, and school pickups, like strange apparitions of help and care. Despite her jokes about her fantasy, sometimes the physical proximity of these grandparents made her feel unbearably alienated, even as she enjoyed making small talk with them. They were, more often than not, impressed by her and her accomplishments, which was so different from both her father and her in-laws, who regarded her as significant only for having produced grandchildren, whom they did not make extraordinary efforts to see, because they all disliked the city, were convinced they\\u2019d be murdered in broad daylight upon entering it, because of what they\\u2019d seen on the news. It made sense to have children if you knew that you would have someone to support you. In evolutionary terms, it turned out, this was called the \\u201cgrandmother theory\\u201d: having a grandmother to help with the children had been promoting longevity and survival all the way back to the hunter-gatherer days. There were articles, in the Health and Aging section of the paper, about how to stay fit as you got older so that you could be present for your grandchildren. There was something about this that irritated her, the idea that she was supposed to stay healthy and sharp enough so that, at the end of her life, she could again find herself picking up after young children, without any wage or recompense, in this future and speculative identity of grandmother. As she was complaining about this, her friend suggested that perhaps what she needed was a replacement grandparent. Although the friend said this in a joking way, she found herself thinking about, even fantasizing about, this idea. Since her mother had been dead for twenty years, could she somehow find a replacement grandmother? Many cultures had the practice of hiring a designated mourner; a replacement grandmother would be something like that. Could she find someone to care if the baby had had a fever for five days, and to ask questions, and to check in? She couldn\\u2019t afford to hire a babysitter, even occasionally, so how could she possibly afford a replacement grandmother? But that was the thing: it would have to be a volunteer position, or it wouldn\\u2019t work. It would have to be someone who took an interest in the ordinary repetitions of her day, and who found her children special. But, for it to work, that person would have to know her, have intimate knowledge of her history, know even what she herself had been like as a small child. Otherwise the performance of love and devotion would feel empty, or artificial, like the rehearsed gestures of mourning.

The builders, in their defense, said that the layer had simply been forgotten about, not left out in an intentional move to save money. The building was faculty housing, occupied only by professors and their families. All but one professor were untenured. Half had kids under ten.\\n\\nThe layer had been found to be missing during a city inspection a decade ago. Repairs were put off for nine years. The school, as both employer and landlord, cited extreme busyness, and pointed out that, despite the missing barrier, no actual apartment floods had occurred. Year ten there was a global pandemic, but year ten was also the end of the remediation period, so construction had to start. The contractor hosted a virtual meeting to explain the many phases of the process. The slide show had several typos. \\u201cDemolition\\u201d became \\u201cdemonition\\u201d; no apartment number was listed correctly. How disruptive would all this be, the dance professor asked, and the cherub-faced blond contractor\\u2019s spokesman answered politely, \\u201cVery much so, ma\\u2019am.\\u201d Then the chemistry professor chimed in about particulates. If the entire brick fa\\u00e7ade was being torn off, what was being done about air-quality control? The chemistry professor had small children. Small children had small lungs. The blond man said that they would tape over everyone\\u2019s windows. They would tape over the vents of everyone\\u2019s A.C.s. \\u201cSo, no A.C.s or windows?\\u201d another professor asked. \\u201cAll through summer, no opening windows or running A.C.s?\\u201d This professor, who taught biology and kept on the building\\u2019s rooftop a colony of honeybees, was not known to repeat himself. The blond man said that that was correct. And that the rooftop would be closed to accommodate the rigging, so the bee colony would have to be moved.\\n\\nTo better address the concerns of the tenants, a second virtual meeting was called, and predictably it went much worse.\\n\\nThe third virtual meeting was cancelled, and, a day later, scaffolding went up. Spaghetti-like ropes encased the building, and men in orange vests carrying hammer drills appeared on skinny platform lifts. Windows were covered with a neon-blue film that turned every room into an aquarium and gave tenants headaches. \\u201cNo one\\u2019s complained about the blue film before,\\u201d the contractor said, though he then admitted to never having worked on an occupied building before. Clear film was procured four days later, the windows retaped.\\n\\nThe contractor did boast about having an on-site hygienist, a woman who was copied on e-mails but whom no one had met.\\n\\nFor three weeks, the noise level was terrible, from nine to five, Monday through Friday, with no pause. The new writing professor was trying to finish a novel but could only write things like \\u201cSo this is what it must feel like to live inside a tooth that a dentist is trying to drill.\\u201d The tooth occupied her thoughts nightly. She hadn\\u2019t gone to the dentist in years. Red dust coated the window film; plumes of smoke were seen. The religion professor brought up the plumes, how, from her red-tinted window, they seemed cloudlike even. The contractor replied immediately, copying the hygienist, to clarify that what the professor saw was not a plume or anything close to a cloud but a puff of smoke being aggrandized by the wind.\\n\\nEach morning, there was an e-mail update explaining which units would be most directly affected that day, though the apartment numbers were still incorrect. So, to figure out if you were truly going to be affected, you had to watch for where the huge mechanical pulley on the roof was dropping lifts. Glancing up at the building from the outside, the ceramics professor was reminded of his childhood, and that unwinnable arcade game with a bin of plush toys and a slippery claw. He was on the corner waiting for Mister Softee. He was waiting for Mister Softee because his three boys, who were inside, had told him to text them when the truck was in sight.\\n\\nThe technical term for what was missing was flashing\\u2014an embedded sheet of metal that prevents moisture from penetrating a building\\u2019s walls. Flashing is particularly important at junctions, around windows, vent pipes, etc. No one thought anymore of the word\\u2019s other meanings\\u2014committing indecent exposure, for example, running buck naked across a green field in a Superman cape, as the six-year-old son of the dance professor had done during his first soccer game.\\n\\nInclement weather set in one weekend, a hurricane muscling through from the south. Rain fell for three days and nights, and the history professor, whose apartment was right below the pulley, said it sounded as if it were raining within the walls. Could there be a leak? He sent the company an audio clip. The company responded a minute later. Leaks were impossible. They had sealed all the leaks because that was what they were here to do. Below the history professor lived a math professor, who all weekend had been collecting the water that had funnelled into her office through the ceiling. She used a one-gallon bucket, and she\\u2019d emptied the bucket into the bathtub five times. The math professor was married to the East Asian Studies professor. Not that ironically, the former was Asian and the latter white. Between gallons three and four, the former had drafted an angry e-mail to the school, but then stared at her unnuanced message. She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.\\n\\nOver text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured resident\\u2014an economics professor\\u2014to declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. He\\u2019d left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.\\n\\nWithin the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the project\\u2019s architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the building\\u2019s foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the company\\u2019s scope. They dealt only with fa\\u00e7ades. Another company did foundations.\\n\\nThe next weekend, another storm front came through. Seven gallons, the math professor counted. In the history professor\\u2019s bedroom, a paint bubble, the height and width of a man, appeared on the wall overnight. He poked the bubble, afraid that it might actually be a person, like his department chair, and was sprayed, drenched, in brown water.\\n\\nThe professors lamented in the laundry room. What kind of collective e-mail to send, and in what tone? A seven-hundred-word one was drafted, with bulleted questions for further discussion. The e-mail was edited down to three hundred words, then ballooned again to a thousand.\\n\\n\\u201cWe must withhold rent,\\u201d the ethics professor said\\u2014a thought that gave the non-activist professors palpitations.\\n\\nThe walls of the water-filled units now felt spongy, and eventually a two-hundred-word e-mail was sent, signed by all the untenured professors, and ending with the sentence \\u201cWe demand immediate action.\\u201d Within an hour, a fit young man arrived and handed everyone he met a business card. The card said that he was the vice-president of the company. The man noted the places where water was still seeping in. He said that there would likely be mold growth, and, should the mold be the color of soot, coal, or volcanic ash, they would need to call in the hygienist to culture it. Not all strains are toxic, he informed them. Some were perfectly O.K. In addition, he\\u2019d gone up to the roof and found no visible faults around the pulley system, so perhaps the leak was a pre\\u00ebxisting condition that had suddenly, coincidentally, got worse. \\u201cThings like this do happen,\\u201d he insisted, and added that, once the scaffolding was removed, the foundation would naturally rise up, against gravity, to its previous position. Then he tipped his hard hat at the professors and wished them a good day.\\n\\nSo construction went on unimpeded, and more storms came through, and more gallons were collected. Spores grew in the wet areas, none whose colors were quite right to be cultured. Rent was paid reliably; no more complaints were filed. In time, the professors all arrived at the same conclusion. Was the leak really that bad? On good days, it sounded like living next to a waterfall. Push through it, the way you did in grad school; then, once you get tenure, you can fly to Crete.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story centers around a group of professors and their families who live in faculty housing.

As they enter the mountains, the music stops and the woman looks out the window, suggesting that this is where Johnny Cash, the American singer they mentioned earlier, traditionally enters a scene or a narrative with his music.

She is better at sentences. Games they like to play involve the former, and he wins the vast majority of them the vast majority of the time. Debates they find themselves in involve the latter, and there hasn\\u2019t been an occasion (on record) of him winning one for many, many years.\\n\\nCrosswords, Scrabble, that new game with green and yellow squares, he excels at. Given six tries to guess a five-letter word, he is quicker to recall words without real vowels (she doesn\\u2019t support the idea that \\u201cY\\u201d is a vowel), and he has the nerve to guess words with triple letters, like \\u201cfluff,\\u201d on the second try. Of course, she knows what fluff is. It\\u2019s either bullshit or the stuffing that comes out of cheap toys. But it\\u2019s not a word she would have guessed.\\n\\nIn defense of \\u201cY\\u201d \\u2019s vowelness, he asks, What about \\u201clynx\\u201d?\\n\\nLynx? she replies, incredulous. When have you ever used that aloud? Oh, look, over there, that lynx is about to pounce and rip out my heart! She is certain that any person in such a scenario would use the word \\u201cbobcat.\\u201d\\n\\nWhat most infuriates her is the presumption that she must be a whiz at words given her vocation as a writer of books. She is gifted calendar crossword puzzles (yes, three hundred and sixty-five tiny crosswords, one sheet for each day) every December, and is often dragged into long bouts of Words with Friends. In one game, he scores more than seventy points with a well-placed \\u201cQ.\\u201d She loses that game soon enough and texts him, You\\u2019re always doing stuff like that, calculating the value of each word. But that\\u2019s how you play\\u2014those are the rules, he replies. She calls into question these rules: is the point system for letters really based on frequency, or is it some larger institutional metric of mind control? He repeats, But those are the rules. On her darkest of writing days, she takes the last sentence she wrote and tallies it up for points. She is immensely disappointed. Then she stares at those crossword calendars, and they stare back. The five she was gifted this holiday season, plus several from last year. They sit all over her desk like blind cats. Hundreds if not thousands of empty squares.\\n\\nShe wonders why she is so bad at word games and has convinced herself that it\\u2019s because she knows too many words. Also, writers don\\u2019t like to be told what to write. A four-letter word for sleeveless garment, today\\u2019s crossword demands. But why is it \\u201ctank\\u201d and not \\u201cvest\\u201d?\\n\\nHis vocation is probably important: a computer scientist, a programmer, a coder. His work involves numbers and really simple words like \\u201cinput,\\u201d \\u201cprint,\\u201d or \\u201crun.\\u201d Coding also involves punctuation, which she is terrible at. An English teacher once asked her if she\\u2019d ever met a comma in her life. A comma after every fourth word is how she does it, regardless of what the word is (the answer to her teacher\\u2019s question being no), and thank God for copy editors. He is skilled with commas, semicolons, dashes, and slashes, and spends most of the workweek combing through code for a misplaced parenthesis that has misfired an array. Arrays are built into other arrays. Macros built into other macros.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t think I can write a sentence like that, she thinks. A sentence nestled into another, like whatever that turducken dish is, or, more simply, like an onion, the five-letter word she did not guess on the day it was the word to guess. Being the same on either side, the word \\u201conion\\u201d is an onion, the \\u201ci\\u201d bisecting it like a core. She texts him this amazing realization, only to thereby reveal the answer to the word game before he has had a chance to play. He texts back, Thanks, what unexpected luck.\\n\\nHe is also better at phrases, especially at guessing them when they are hidden behind white cubes. He was raised on \\u201cWheel of Fortune,\\u201d and, whenever they watch that program together, he shouts at the people inside the television, Why are you buying vowels? His favorite category is Before and After, or, to her, the category of nonsensical phrases. \\u201cNew baby buggy,\\u201d for instance. She keeps getting stuck on the chronology. Isn\\u2019t a baby by default new? And buggy, an outdated term for the first motorized vehicles with open tops? The Model T was a buggy, wasn\\u2019t it? So, on the time line of existence, an old car should come before a new baby. That\\u2019s not how any of this works, he replies. But, now that they\\u2019ve touched on the chicken-and-egg problem, they have to persist. She accepts that words came before the sentence, but argues that, in the same way calculus was invented to serve physics, words were created to construct sentences. The selection and sequence of words constitute meaning. The sentence is the final boss. After thinking that over, he says, But I like calculus, and she says, Which is fine. Great, even! There\\u2019s nothing wrong with calculus. She pats him on the arm.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s called having \\u201cthe last word,\\u201d not \\u201cthe last sentence.\\u201d So we can\\u2019t end there, with her patting him on the arm and going on and on about sentences. A piece of trivia dislodges in his brain: \\u201ccalculus\\u201d comes from the Latin for small pebble. Pebbles as used on an abacus, to count out money, votes, and distances. In medicine, the word is still used for a solid mass made from mineral salts that can form in organs or ducts. A kidney stone is a calculus. A kidney stone can cause great pain. In high school, everyone sat in metal chairs and had sore backs. Everyone groaned about calculus homework; everyone complained to the teacher, including him.

There were two women sitting at the table with Bo. Floretta was nudging Cloletha\\u2019s shoulder. Both were snapping their fingers to a jukebox song. Norman bought four beers and then sat down with them.\\n\\nIn Chicasetta, time hadn\\u2019t so much passed as crept out Norman\\u2019s back door. He and Barbara-Pam had grown up together in the same church and had attended the same segregated schools. Barbara-Pam\\u2019s mama was a widow, but, when men tried to court her, she\\u2019d tell them she\\u2019d had herself a good love. She didn\\u2019t need nary other. And Barbara-Pam wanted that kind of man, like her daddy had been to her mama.\\n\\nShe\\u2019d caught Norman\\u2019s eye when he was sixteen. He was good-looking, muscular, and knew it. Bo was his ace and full of laughter until he got called up to Vietnam, after graduation. But nineteen was still just an idea that year, and those boys walked the halls of the Negro high school like they were kings in a land where dark skin equalled royalty.\\n\\nBarbara-Pam was pretty back in high school, but so was Floretta. Or maybe Floretta was just all right. Who knew? You couldn\\u2019t take your eyes off them big legs, and, if you tried to lift your gaze, there was that nice, round behind. Floretta\\u2019s mama was a widow, too, of a sort. The man who\\u2019d gotten her pregnant had gone to the electric chair. She insisted they\\u2019d been headed to the altar, but couldn\\u2019t nobody verify that story. The mother and daughter went to church at Mt. Calvary, where the siddity Negroes worshipped and sang true hymns, instead of lining-out spirituals.\\n\\nThe tension between what Floretta promised behind the high school and what Barbara-Pam pretended she didn\\u2019t know existed had eventually made the choice for Norman. But Barbara-Pam\\u2019s shyness gave way two years after they were married. She climbed on top of him, and he found he was disappointed in her pleasure. She was not as pristine as he\\u2019d thought. She\\u2019d simply been ignorant.\\n\\nThe years abandoned Norman. He was in his thirties, past his Jesus year. He was a deacon at his and Barbara-Pam\\u2019s church, where his father had served in the same pious role. When Norman opened the back door of his house, no unexpected tremors greeted him. Barbara-Pam rolled up her hair at night with pink curlers and wore flowered housedresses that reminded Norman of his own mama, an antidote to any man\\u2019s rising nature.\\n\\nThat night at the Legion, Norman put the beers down on the table, but Bo and Cloletha rose and left, holding hands. Floretta didn\\u2019t even look toward the door where the two had departed. She swayed in her seat and mouthed the words along to \\u201cWoman to Woman.\\u201d She told Norman that this was her song.\\n\\nEverybody in town knew that Bo was married and didn\\u2019t have no business with Cloletha, but Bo was Norman\\u2019s best friend. Bo had changed and gone quiet after coming back from the war. Still, an ace was for life. You had to stay with him, or else what was honor? Wasn\\u2019t that the meaning of a friendship stronger than the bones that held your gore and spirit? Norman told himself that he was only sitting at the table to wait for Bo. That was all he intended.\\n\\nBut word travelled to Barbara-Pam that Floretta had slid onto the seat of her husband\\u2019s pickup, and they\\u2019d driven off into the dark. When Norman opened his front door, Barbara-Pam was waiting. She was tired, she said. Didn\\u2019t nothing seem to make him happy no more. He had a good, faithful woman and two little girls who were crazy about him, but he didn\\u2019t seem to care. She ordered him out, though the house was in his name.\\n\\nGiven the expense of divorce, he figured it was cheaper to keep Barbara-Pam, but he started living with Floretta full time. After a few years of private remonstrations from his minister, and his mama refusing to let him attend Sunday dinners at her house, which was only a few yards across the field from his technical dwelling, Norman compromised: he began spending a couple of nights a week with Barbara-Pam.\\n\\nHe got to thinking that all things were possible, like when he\\u2019d walked the halls of Chicasetta Colored High School. Like he was a man across the ocean in Africa, one who had a right to more than one wife. Whenever Barbara-Pam started in with her nagging, he\\u2019d remind her: Don\\u2019t get too feisty. Surprisingly, however, the loving had returned with Barbara-Pam. He began to enjoy it when she climbed on top. Also, there was the smothered cube steak she made for him on alternate Saturday nights.\\n\\nThen Floretta\\u2019s baby boy came, and she started giving Norman a settling-down eye, and he decided Barbara-Pam was his choice. They had made vows in front of a preacher, it didn\\u2019t make no sense to keep bouncing back and forth, and, truth be told, Norman just couldn\\u2019t keep up no more. Their little boy had been walking for a month the Friday he packed the things he kept at Floretta\\u2019s place, but she didn\\u2019t cry. She told him, \\u201cJust \\u2019cause the cock crow, don\\u2019t make the sun rise.\\u201d He thought about that for more days than he cared to admit, but he never could parse it through.\\n\\nThe Sunday morning after their true reconciliation, Norman reached for his wife, but she wasn\\u2019t in bed. He smelled sausage cooking: church mornings weren\\u2019t the same if there wasn\\u2019t pork on the table, and he sure hoped there were biscuits and grits as well. He quickly showered, dried off, then went to the closet, where he found that Barbara-Pam had splattered his deacon\\u2019s suits with bleach. Even his pride and joy, the maroon one with pointy-toed gaiters to match. Somehow, he\\u2019d been sound asleep while his woman had done this.\\n\\nIt took Norman two months to save enough for new church suits, and he was too old-fashioned to wear work clothes to Sunday services. On those heathen days, he\\u2019d drive to his old high school, which was now integrated. Not only law but custom had finally changed, and Norman didn\\u2019t even recognize the place. On school days, there were no loud boasts from boys, no girls fanning their bottoms. He sat in his truck and listened to the radio until he had to turn it off to save the battery. The paved parking lot wasn\\u2019t the dusty strip that had been there in Norman\\u2019s prime, in the right-handed kingdom of years past.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Norman is a middle-aged man living in a small town called Chicasetta.

It was difficult to understand exactly how the Jewish people had got on Anatoly\\u2019s bad side. Maybe Moses hadn\\u2019t been polite when asking Anatoly\\u2019s ancestors for directions to the promised land? Still, although Anatoly was filled with burning hatred for Jews, he didn\\u2019t admit his guilt in an assassination attempt. It wasn\\u2019t so much his conviction that upset him as the fact that he wasn\\u2019t put in a high-security prison, where, Anatoly believed, the real terrorists went. Terrorism, as a rule, is considered a serious crime that could earn you a strict sentence of life imprisonment, but for some reason the court decided to take pity on Anatoly. Either the criminal, in the court\\u2019s opinion, was not dangerous or the evidence was inconclusive. Or maybe the leniency was due to the fact that, as the state of Israel apparently noted in black and white in the accusation against him, there were no victims, no damage, and no claims.\\n\\nAnatoly had been outed to the special services by a friend, who told them that Anatoly was planning to blow up the Israeli Embassy and its Ambassador and had invited him to participate in this exciting event. The friend also handed over some explosives and a flash drive with recordings of his conversations with Anatoly. Anatoly was arrested. He did not confess. The investigators checked the explosives for prints. There were some, but they belonged to Anatoly\\u2019s comrade, not him. The investigators listened to the conversations on the flash drive and discerned some indistinct muttering that led them to make broad conclusions about Anatoly\\u2019s fantasies, but there was nothing about preparing for an explosion. The only substantial evidence was his friend\\u2019s testimony, although the friendship was unlikely to survive such a turn of events. In court, Anatoly pleaded not guilty but delivered a fiery speech about the threat of Zionism to the world. The judge gave him a seven-year sentence because you never knew what could happen.\\n\\nAnatoly was well over fifty. He had a wife and three boys. After the arrest, the youngest son, who was seven, waited a long time for his father to return from his business trip. He watched the news on TV, wishing for a quick end to the war in Donbas, which he believed was the reason his father could not come home\\u2014because it had stopped the trains from running. As usually happens with these sorts of cases, it was difficult to find the extremist. The judge is sure that the investigators wouldn\\u2019t just accuse anyone they come across, especially if the evidence is weak or nonexistent. The investigators work with the material that the field operatives have dug up, conferring on it an almost divine quality. The field operatives seize on any excuse to inflate the importance and existential necessity of their team. And this is how cases involving guys like Anatoly multiply all over Russia, while security forces receive orders and titles, TV channels scare their viewers with talk of terrorists, and the people shudder a little but then sigh in gratitude that such vigilant special-services officers are there to protect them. No one cares that, somewhere, a little boy waits for the trains to bring his father home from a business trip. Such is the state\\u2019s ruthless, repressive machine, which grinds up people\\u2019s futures. Well, at least the Putin regime has not yet resorted to mass executions\\u2014unlike the Stalinist one, when people disappeared into the unknown by the millions. Things were done quietly and in secret then, and everyone tiptoed in fear. Today\\u2019s Russia prefers show trials, to make people terrified of becoming one of those highly publicized examples.\\n\\nAnatoly was of medium height, lean, and athletic for his age. He aimed to go to bed early, before lights-out if possible. To insure a good night\\u2019s sleep, he\\u2019d plug his ears with red paraffin wax that he had scraped from cheese rinds. He also wore a homemade black eye mask to block out any interference from the duty light. In this state of sensory deprivation, he\\u2019d set off to visit Morpheus. In the morning, he rose long before sunrise. Having unsealed his ears and removed his Zorro mask, he washed with cold water at the sink and began his yoga. Each new cellmate, upon waking, was horrified to see the life-threatening positions into which Uncle Tolya contorted himself, and rushed to save him. But there was no need for help: Anatoly unfurled himself independently. During his exercise time in the prison yard, he demonstrated how good he felt, raising his hands and greeting the sun with barely audible whispers, then racing around the cramped courtyard, practically running on the walls. When he was drenched with sweat, he would pause, still not out of breath, put on a special hat with a paper ball tied to it with string, and begin boxing furiously. Anatoly was a master of such homemade devices, and this was one of his most impressive. Even the guards, who had seen a lot in their lifetimes, would stop and watch from above, captivated, as Anatoly\\u2019s ball twirled around. He did little actual boxing, but, judging by the way he relentlessly attacked and defended himself from the ubiquitous ball, it was clear that he had his own unique style.\\n\\nAnatoly didn\\u2019t smoke or have any vices, but he found a unique use for matches. He would burn bread crusts, using them to light or fumigate corners, and even creating fire circles in harmless Zoroastrian rituals. Anatoly was also studying Farsi\\u2014an interest perhaps born of his desire to check the Ayatollah Khomeini Telegram channel for the celebratory news that the Israeli Embassy had been bombed. His progress was slow, but, as Anatoly himself would say, \\u201cThe language is several thousand years old,\\u201d so he was in no rush.\\n\\nIn many ways, Anatoly was a fairly typical inmate, but, as soon as the conversation shifted to the Jewish question, particularly when he himself redirected it there, his cell was filled with visions of Jewish Freemasons who controlled the world, weaving intricate plots and schemes with long-range goals beyond mere mortals\\u2019 comprehension. The main question for Anatoly was: How can we fight all this? And the first answer that came to his mind involved explosives.\\n\\nAnatoly was a seasoned ideological combatant, well versed not only in the so-called Jewish world conspiracy but in the intricacies of Putin\\u2019s regime. For many years, he\\u2019d followed a crazy colonel who intended to overthrow Putin with the help of a couple of divisions that were loyal to him, plus tanks, submarine mini-boats in the Moscow River, and volunteers like Anatoly in a paramilitary organization named after Minin and Pozharsky. The uprising failed: either the tanks didn\\u2019t arrive on schedule or the submarines surfaced in the wrong place. The colonel was imprisoned for a long time, but he continued to direct appeals to his supporters and shower curses on the heads of his enemies.\\n\\nIn his youth, Anatoly had served in Soviet military intelligence. He was sent to Afghanistan as part of a newly formed Muslim battalion. He did not take part in the Tajbeg Palace assault, but he performed other feats to protect the interests of the Soviet Union in a distant and barren land. Anatoly talked a lot about his service, the exhausting training, the long marches in full gear in a-hundred-and-four-degree heat, his stupid fellow-soldiers, the local life, the war. He described how he had interrogated silent mujahideen fighters by inserting an explosive with a Bickford fuse into their ears. While the fuse was burning, the gift of speech usually returned. The stoic ones had half their heads blown off. Every war has its laws, none of which can be called entirely fair. Anatoly did not like to describe what the mujahideen did to the Soviet soldiers they captured.\\n\\nHe sincerely hated Putin for many reasons, including his attack on Ukraine, a country that Anatoly loved with all his heart and whose fate he now worried about from afar. It was not only because his wife was from there, or because they took a train there for a visit every summer, or because of the delicious food or the good people, and definitely not because of the freedom there after the Maidan Revolution, which he could not appreciate, sitting in his cramped cell. He loved Ukraine because it was dearer to him than his own, criminal country.\\n\\nOnce Anatoly had received his sentence but had not yet been sent to the prison camp, he was allowed a short meeting with his wife in a booth where they were separated by a pane of glass. He returned, pale, to his cell, sat on the bed, and stared at the wall. Two of his best friends, former colleagues, had gone to Donbas to fight for Ukraine and had been burned alive in a damaged Kamaz truck. Anatoly spoke, as if to himself: \\u201cAnd my wife, silly woman, came all dressed up and happy. She says, \\u2018It\\u2019s good you\\u2019re in prison, you old fool. Otherwise, you would have gone with them.\\u2019 \\u201d Anatoly couldn\\u2019t contain himself and started to cry. That evening, he burned even more matches than usual.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Anatoly, a middle-aged man, has been sentenced to seven years in a medium-security prison for planning to blow up the Israeli Embassy and its Ambassador.

Anatoly is disappointed that he wasn't sent to a high-security prison, believing that's where the \\\"real terrorists\\\" are. The court gave him a lenient sentence due to inconclusive evidence and the lack of victims or damage.\\n\\nBefore his arrest, Anatoly's friend had reported him to the special services, providing them with explosives and recordings of their conversations. However, the evidence mostly consisted of Anatoly's friend's testimony, which strained their friendship. Anatoly maintains his innocence and delivers a passionate speech about the threat of Zionism in court. Despite his fiery speech, the judge still sentences him to seven years, citing uncertainty about Anatoly's potential actions.\\n\\nAnatoly has a wife and three sons, and his youngest son, believing his father is away on a business trip, waits for his return, attributing his absence to the ongoing war in Donbas. The story highlights how cases like Anatoly's are common in Russia, where investigators rely on weak or nonexistent evidence, leading to unjust convictions. The state's repressive machine disregards the impact on families and individuals, focusing more on their own agenda.\\n\\nIn prison, Anatoly establishes a routine to ensure a good night's sleep. He practices yoga, running, and boxing in the prison yard, impressing both inmates and guards with his athleticism. Anatoly also uses matches for various purposes, such as burning bread crusts or conducting Zoroastrian rituals. He is studying Farsi, possibly to check for news of the Israeli Embassy bombing.\\n\\nAnatoly's beliefs about Jewish conspiracies and his involvement in paramilitary organizations reveal his deeply-rooted ideological extremism. He despises Putin's regime and passionately supports the Ukrainian cause due to his wife's background and experiences in the country. Anatoly's pain is intensified when two of his friends die tragically during the conflict.\\n\\nThe story portrays Anatoly as a complex character with conflicting beliefs and a strong sense of justice.

Anatoly was arrested, but evidence against him was inconclusive, with his fingerprints being absent from the explosives and the conversations on the flash drive revealing more fantasies than any concrete plan. The only substantial evidence was the testimony of Anatoly's now-former friend.\\n\\nAnatoly reflects on his life before imprisonment, focusing especially on his family. He has a wife and three sons, and his youngest son believes that his father is unable to return home due to a war in Donbas disrupting train services. The narrative shifts towards criticizing the repressive nature of the Russian state and its focus on show trials and protecting its citizens through harsh security measures.\\n\\nAnatoly's daily routines in prison are described, featuring his attempts at a good night's sleep, morning yoga sessions, and intense exercise in the prison yard where he impresses both fellow inmates and guards. Meanwhile, he finds solace by speaking out against Jews, buying into conspiracy theories surrounding their control over the world and secretive plots and schemes.

Me and my cousin were trying to learn the language, but there were . . . issues. Some people were with us, and some were against us. The former said anyone who wanted to learn should learn, we didn\\u2019t have time to waste, our mother tongue was dying. The others, they said we had too much white blood, we were not dark enough, we acted like we were too good for them! Man. Indian Country. The old guy said that long ago the people were pitiful and it was the wolves that showed us how to live with one another. The vision was one of compassion and order and beauty so fierce I could not grasp it. He told us the word for wolf. Mako\\u2019iyii. The old people, the ones who spoke the language, they had an interesting way of saying things. Even though they talked English, you could tell some other part of them was talking another language at the same time, one I should know, but don\\u2019t. I guess that\\u2019s just how things worked out, isn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nThe guy we were talking to, he was one of those old people who always wore a hat. My gram used to wear this bright-yellow broad-brimmed affair of woven straw. You could see her from way off, walking with her cane, and, if you went up to her, no matter how long it had been, she would demand a hug, and she was much stronger than you expected. It was like this. One old guy, he wore these glasses. I don\\u2019t know where he got them, they might have been the only pair of their kind on earth. This one time I saw him without them. For a second, I had no idea who he was. It\\u2019s not a hat, but you know what I\\u2019m saying. Those old people, they\\u2019re all gone now. I felt a freedom then, when I was at home and the mountains were there and the indescribable plains were there and the sunsets cast a light so serene over the land\\u2014you could think for a moment that everything was O.K. Sometimes, though, at night, I would wake in a proverbial cold sweat, and it seemed I had heard this howling sound, like the way wind sounds as it runs down and through a narrow canyon.\\n\\nThe old guy wore a black cowboy hat, and his face was dark brown and narrow with a long nose and heavy eyelids, and his lips were so dark they took on a purple hue, and he wore black sunglasses even indoors. You had this sense of import when you were around him, he was a line of dark energy running through a room. That\\u2019s how the truth feels. But there was this eagle feather in the hat band, and it was too big, it was obscene somehow, but seeing it made you smile. He might have been a cartoon, but then you talked to him and you understood why there was no in-between with him, people loved him or hated him. His hands were big and heavy-seeming and scarred, and he was always clasping them on the table in front of him. You could not look away. Like a lot of men his age, he had been a street fighter when he was young and even when he smiled there was a threat in it. The three of us usually talked at the casino, and the ones who were against us would see us, and they hated it because there was nothing they could say with him around. They didn\\u2019t know the language at all, or what they did know they mutilated like someone standing at a butcher\\u2019s block holding a cleaver for the first time. He was generous to their faces and laughed at them when they were gone.\\n\\nMe and my cousin, we spent a lot of time with him, and learned about the old ways and how you might think about things now. There was a lot of talk, how things could be if only x and y. In the end, what I learned is that a language is a way of seeing, and there is almost no way to see in the old way now. Because of the feather, his appearance from a distance was jaunty, a word that has never been used to describe people where I am from. One time we asked him about this idea of indian blood and how we might talk about it in the language, and he thought for a while. He ran the pointer and middle fingers of one hand down the inside of the other forearm\\u2014strange how soft the inside of an arm is, you could cut a person wide open\\u2014and he said this phrase in the language. I can\\u2019t remember it anymore. He told us it meant the government was watching our blood. I felt again the colossal thing looming over us all. I guess you might call it history, but that\\u2019s not quite the word, is it. I wanted to throttle the thing with my bare hands, but the past is immune to even our most desperate aggressions and, anyway, I am not the type. The old guy\\u2019s last name was Wolf Striker. Or that\\u2019s how you say it in English. Sometimes when I was alone at night I would say it in the language\\u2014Mako\\u2019iyawakkii\\u2014and imagine myself in the same place but a very different time.\\n\\nListen to me for once. Here is how it works. You look at a thing, and then you look at something else, and when you look back the first thing is different somehow. A value makes its shape known only to the corner of your eye. One day I looked away from the old guy, and when I looked back it was his funeral. I got a call from my uncle. I had gone back to school, I was in a study carrel, reading a text on Indigenous plant medicines written by a professor from Sweden. I was broke, but my auntie gave me gas money to go home. The funeral was one of those things you may not see again. The priest had tried to come in, and there was a fight in front of the building where the bodies are put out, because the old guy had said there should be no priest. I knew why he said it, and I knew that I would say the same whenever my time was near. The church has had us in a choke hold for a long time now. Someone had one-punched Father Allen and laid him out flat on the sidewalk, and then another guy stepped in and really put the boots to him. You knew it was a story that would never go away, that cocksucker on the ground with his broken glasses, crying out, Please God! Inside, the old guy\\u2019s body was in the casket, and his arms were crossed over his chest, and his best boots, the black ones with the embroidered flowers, were on his feet, and the black cowboy hat was off to one side but the feather was missing. Some of the people who were against us were at the funeral, and they said how sorry they were he was gone they were so sorry they had never been this sorry. He was the last great speaker of our language, etc. I watched them go one by one to the mike near the casket, and while they spoke I invited my most murderous thoughts to join me. Then I dropped out of college. Phone calls, e-mails, letters came, even a text. (Hi K____! Your absence from Twentieth-Century U.S. History is noticeable. . . .) I ignored them all. There was nothing left in me. I told family and relatives the things he had taught me and my cousin. This idea of indian blood, I said, half this and a quarter that. It\\u2019s just more white-man bullshit. This isn\\u2019t our way! But no one cared. One of my cousins listened for a while and then bummed a twenty spot. When I went back to school the next year, I don\\u2019t know. There was this white girl in my tribal-sovereignty course. I tried to talk indian law with her, but she just wanted to talk traditional foods. One night she offered profound and considered commentary on the situation. You look white to me, she said. After that I thought often about taking her back to the reservation. We would go to Big Bear Alley, where everyone who lives on the street sleeps in the summer. I would say, This one here and that one there and this one over here who looks sorta like me\\u2014these are my relatives. Is that authentic enough, I would say. Does that meet your criteria, you fucking bitch.\\n\\nThe dreams came back for a while. I dropped out for good. Things really do end. Sometimes, when there is no moon and the soft starry arc of the mako\\u2019iyo\\u201dso\\u2019koi is cast across the sky like a mother\\u2019s arms and I cannot sleep, I drive to a spot on the flats where you can hear the wolves. I roll down my window and listen. They come sleek and systematic and regal down from the mountains and through the canyons, and some of them howl while the others assert themselves over the coyotes and ranch dogs who yelp and cry out in the dark. You would not believe the sound. In my head I can still hear his voice. Out on the flats it is an absolute slaughter.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story revolves around the narrator and their cousin's attempt to learn their indigenous language, despite facing opposition from some people in their community who believe they are not \\\"dark enough\\\" or that they act superior.

He\\u2019d imagine that he was running away from home, escaping down a river like Huckleberry Finn, or going to live in secret like a hermit in one of the deserted little bridge-tender houses. He never tired of seeing the street split open as the bridge lifted its asphalt arms to the sky. He loved watching the rusty barges, heaped with demolished cars, floating by on river time, while street traffic waited, jammed bumper to bumper. At night, eruptions of acetylene-blue sparks and furnaces flaring behind charred foundry windows coated the oily water with visions of hellfire. But, even as a kid, Romy sensed that, if a toxic river flowing backward as it carried out the city\\u2019s sewage could enthrall him, then he needed to see the ocean as soon as possible.\\n\\nThe Navy taught him to box.

We glance around to be sure that no one is watching and push inside.\\n\\nI expect it to be dark, but the tile floors gleam at the mouths of corridors, and a shaft of light suspending dust as if it were photons streams down the stairs.

Like the river, the windows are sheathed in a pane of ice. It has patched over all the cracked and broken places that shine a coppery pink through the frost, like wounds through gauze. Dusk shoots like laser beams through the bullet holes. The track of a push broom on the floor has shaped a tiny dune of shattered glass mottled with flakes of lead paint and bird droppings. We stare up into a skylight whitewashed by generations of pigeons.\\n\\n\\u201cIt feels like we\\u2019re in a story together,\\u201d she says.\\n\\n\\u201cMore like a poem.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat poem would that be?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cRemember that old anthology of Chicago poets we used to page through for something to read at slams, Sandburg\\u2019s \\u2018the fog comes on little cat feet,\\u2019 Brooks\\u2019s \\u2018We Real Cool\\u2019?

Despite not being the protagonist's godfather, Uncle Romy feels a sense of responsibility to guide and mentor the protagonist, offering advice on love and life.\\n\\nOne of Uncle Romy's suggestions for winning back a lost love interest involves calling them unexpectedly and suggesting a walk. The protagonist seeks clarification from Uncle Romy, asking where they should go on this walk. Uncle Romy emphasizes that the location does not matter.

I\\u2019d never thought that I would teach high-school Latin, although I was equipped to do so. As for the substitution: they didn\\u2019t explain if the teacher I was stepping in for was sick or had died or been fired; his absence sounded more like a time-out. It was not only time that seemed frozen; the school did, too. Something had sucked the air out of that place: at school functions, students did not breathe, and the teachers\\u2019 lounge featured enormous portraits of illustrious rectors, plus a gigantic one of a major naval battle. The teachers\\u2019 lounge was dark, as were the courtyards, and in those places I would sense disapproving looks aimed in my direction.\\n\\nThere was surely a modern methodology for teaching Latin, but that place prevented me from making any plans. I would go in terrified and feel calm again only once I was at least two blocks away. I felt that everything I did was wrong; my fear was a kind of animal fear, and I was just relieved that they didn\\u2019t beat me or lock me inside.\\n\\nThe school has always been a nest for fledgling leaders, dissidents, and success stories, but, at thirteen and fourteen years old, those kids were punished for any little thing; a security guard, who was said to work for the police, did not allow them to go to the bathroom during classroom hours, no exceptions. Those were the conditions I had to work in, and teaching Latin no less. The sentences my students translated went like this:\\n\\n    The slave prepares a dinner of roasted eel for the lady.\\n    The dog must be obedient to his owner, the child to his parents.\\n    Young lady, put on the light-blue toga to honor our goddess.\\n    Caesar advances forty-five parasangs with his Army.\\n\\nHow far is a \\u201cparasang\\u201d? Whom could I ask?\\n\\n    Young lady, you must put flowers on the goddess\\u2019s altar and cinnabar on Janus\\u2019.\\n\\nWhat might \\u201ccinnabar\\u201d be? The students were going to fuck with me by asking, but neither I nor they actually wanted to know. Having made a fool of myself, I would leave the school still not knowing such things, and if, as I expected, some punishment were to be inflicted upon me, at least I would know the reason. The texts used such restrictive and cruel language; it was always an order, a demand, an altar for some goddess. But the passage I hated most was the one by Arria, the matron who, with great conviction, told her sick husband in one room that their son, who had died in another, was getting better and had eaten a hearty meal.\\n\\nSince I taught Latin class from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M., I would lighten the mood by teaching Roman culture in the second hour and describing what the Romans ate.\\n\\nOne thing I always found odd about Roman cuisine was that one creature was cooked inside another. For example, you might find a goose inside a pig, and, inside the goose, a little chicken, all of this smeared in honey, the glue that kept it together.\\n\\nI would say to my students, \\u201cHow interesting!\\u201d\\n\\nAnd they would reply, \\u201cDisgusting! Why are you telling us this\\u2014and right at noon!\\u201d\\n\\nI also taught them that, in ancient Rome, people would toss everything in the streets\\u2014piss and all the rest. The lesson generated such an uproar that I wasn\\u2019t able to contain it. I was saved by the bell, but the security guard who was with the police still came in and stared at me. I fled to a caf\\u00e9 that was about five blocks away and not on my regular route; I wandered around like a lost puppy. When I sat down, the caf\\u00e9 seemed extraordinary to me, the street like a sanctuary, and the waiter a prince.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The narrator reluctantly takes on a position as a substitute Latin teacher at the National School of Buenos Aires, an elite preparatory school.

The people of the village began to gather in the square, between the post office and the bank, around ten o\\u2019clock; in some towns there were so many people that the lottery took two days and had to be started on June 26th, but in this village, where there were only about three hundred people, the whole lottery took only about two hours, so it could begin at ten o\\u2019clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner.\\n\\nThe children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous play, and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix\\u2014the villagers pronounced this name \\u201cDellacroy\\u201d\\u2014eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at the boys, and the very small children rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.\\n\\nSoon the men began to gather, surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother\\u2019s grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother.\\n\\nThe lottery was conducted\\u2014as were the square dances, the teen-age club, the Halloween program\\u2014by Mr. Summers, who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him, because he had no children and his wife was a scold. When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called, \\u201cLittle late today, folks.\\u201d The postmaster, Mr. Graves, followed him, carrying a three-legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between themselves and the stool, and when Mr. Summers said, \\u201cSome of you fellows want to give me a hand?,\\u201d there was a hesitation before two men, Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers inside it.\\n\\nThe original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box now resting on the stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest man in town, was born. Mr. Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box, but no one liked to upset even as much tradition as was represented by the black box. There was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down to make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking again about a new box, but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything\\u2019s being done. The black box grew shabbier each year; by now it was no longer completely black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in some places faded or stained.\\n\\nMr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, held the black box securely on the stool until Mr. Summers had stirred the papers thoroughly with his hand. Because so much of the ritual had been forgotten or discarded, Mr. Summers had been successful in having slips of paper substituted for the chips of wood that had been used for generations. Chips of wood, Mr. Summers had argued, had been all very well when the village was tiny, but now that the population was more than three hundred and likely to keep on growing, it was necessary to use something that would fit more easily into the black box. The night before the lottery, Mr. Summers and Mr. Graves made up the slips of paper and put them into the box, and it was then taken to the safe of Mr. Summers\\u2019 coal company and locked up until Mr. Summers was ready to take it to the square next morning. The rest of the year, the box was put away, sometimes one place, sometimes another; it had spent one year in Mr. Graves\\u2019 barn and another year underfoot in the post office, and sometimes it was set on a shelf in the Martin grocery and left there.\\n\\nThere was a great deal of fussing to be done before Mr. Summers declared the lottery open. There were the lists to make up\\u2014of heads of families, heads of households in each family, members of each household in each family. There was the proper swearing-in of Mr. Summers by the postmaster, as the official of the lottery; at one time, some people remembered, there had been a recital of some sort, performed by the official of the lottery, a perfunctory, tuneless chant that had been rattled off duly each year; some people believed that the official of the lottery used to stand just so when he said or sang it, others believed that he was supposed to walk among the people, but years and years ago this part of the ritual had been allowed to lapse. There had been, also, a ritual salute, which the official of the lottery had had to use in addressing each person who came up to draw from the box, but this also had changed with time, until now it was felt necessary only for the official to speak to each person approaching. Mr. Summers was very good at all this; in his clean white shirt and blue jeans, with one hand resting carelessly on the black box, he seemed very proper and important as he talked interminably to Mr. Graves and the Martins.\\n\\nJust as Mr. Summers finally left off talking and turned to the assembled villagers, Mrs. Hutchinson came hurriedly along the path to the square, her sweater thrown over her shoulders, and slid into place in the back of the crowd. \\u201cClean forgot what day it was,\\u201d she said to Mrs. Delacroix, who stood next to her, and they both laughed softly. \\u201cThought my old man was out back stacking wood,\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson went on, \\u201cand then I looked out the window and the kids was gone, and then I remembered it was the twenty-seventh and came a-running.\\u201d She dried her hands on her apron, and Mrs. Delacroix said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re in time, though. They\\u2019re still talking away up there.\\u201d\\n\\nMrs. Hutchinson craned her neck to see through the crowd and found her husband and children standing near the front. She tapped Mrs. Delacroix on the arm as a farewell and began to make her way through the crowd. The people separated good-humoredly to let her through; two or three people said, in voices just loud enough to be heard across the crowd, \\u201cHere comes your Mrs., Hutchinson,\\u201d and \\u201cBill, she made it after all.\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson reached her husband, and Mr. Summers, who had been waiting, said cheerfully, \\u201cThought we were going to have to get on without you, Tessie.\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson said, grinning, \\u201cWouldn\\u2019t have me leave m\\u2019dishes in the sink, now, would you, Joe?,\\u201d and soft laughter ran through the crowd as the people stirred back into position after Mrs. Hutchinson\\u2019s arrival.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, now,\\u201d Mr. Summers said soberly, \\u201cguess we better get started, get this over with, so\\u2019s we can go back to work. Anybody ain\\u2019t here?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDunbar,\\u201d several people said. \\u201cDunbar, Dunbar.\\u201d\\n\\nMr. Summers consulted his list. \\u201cClyde Dunbar,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s right. He\\u2019s broke his leg, hasn\\u2019t he? Who\\u2019s drawing for him?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMe, I guess,\\u201d a woman said, and Mr. Summers turned to look at her. \\u201cWife draws for her husband,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. \\u201cDon\\u2019t you have a grown boy to do it for you, Janey?\\u201d Although Mr. Summers and everyone else in the village knew the answer perfectly well, it was the business of the official of the lottery to ask such questions formally. Mr. Summers waited with an expression of polite interest while Mrs. Dunbar answered.\\n\\n\\u201cHorace\\u2019s not but sixteen yet,\\u201d Mrs. Dunbar said regretfully. \\u201cGuess I gotta fill in for the old man this year.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cRight,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. He made a note on the list he was holding. Then he asked, \\u201cWatson boy drawing this year?\\u201d\\n\\nA tall boy in the crowd raised his hand. \\u201cHere,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m drawing for m\\u2019mother and me.\\u201d He blinked his eyes nervously and ducked his head as several voices in the crowd said things like \\u201cGood fellow, Jack,\\u201d and \\u201cGlad to see your mother\\u2019s got a man to do it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, \\u201cguess that\\u2019s everyone. Old Man Warner make it?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHere,\\u201d a voice said, and Mr. Summers nodded.\\n\\nA sudden hush fell on the crowd as Mr. Summers cleared his throat and looked at the list. \\u201cAll ready?\\u201d he called. \\u201cNow, I\\u2019ll read the names\\u2014heads of families first\\u2014and the men come up and take a paper out of the box. Keep the paper folded in your hand without looking at it until everyone has had a turn. Everything clear?\\u201d\\n\\nThe people had done it so many times that they only half listened to the directions; most of them were quiet, wetting their lips, not looking around. Then Mr. Summers raised one hand high and said, \\u201cAdams.\\u201d A man disengaged himself from the crowd and came forward. \\u201cHi, Steve,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, and Mr. Adams said, \\u201cHi, Joe.\\u201d They grinned at one another humorlessly and nervously. Then Mr. Adams reached into the black box and took out a folded paper. He held it firmly by one corner as he turned and went hastily back to his place in the crowd, where he stood a little apart from his family, not looking down at his hand.\\n\\n\\u201cAllen,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. \\u201cAnderson. . . .

You didn\\u2019t give him time enough to choose. Everybody saw that.\\u201d\\n\\nMr. Graves had selected the five slips and put them in the box, and he dropped all the papers but those onto the ground, where the breeze caught them and lifted them off.\\n\\n\\u201cListen, everybody,\\u201d Mrs. Hutchinson was saying to the people around her.\\n\\n\\u201cReady, Bill?\\u201d Mr. Summers asked, and Bill Hutchinson, with one quick glance around at his wife and children, nodded.\\n\\n\\u201cRemember,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, \\u201ctake the slips and keep them folded until each person has taken one. Harry, you help little Dave.\\u201d Mr. Graves took the hand of the little boy, who came willingly with him up to the box. \\u201cTake a paper out of the box, Davy,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. Davy put his hand into the box and laughed. \\u201cTake just one paper,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. \\u201cHarry, you hold it for him.\\u201d Mr. Graves took the child\\u2019s hand and removed the folded paper from the tight fist and held it while little Dave stood next to him and looked up at him wonderingly.\\n\\n\\u201cNancy next,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. Nancy was twelve, and her school friends breathed heavily as she went forward, switching her skirt, and took a slip daintily from the box. \\u201cBill, Jr.,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, and Billy, his face red and his feet overlarge, nearly knocked the box over as he got a paper out. \\u201cTessie,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. She hesitated for a minute, looking around defiantly, and then set her lips and went up to the box. She snatched a paper out and held it behind her.\\n\\n\\u201cBill,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, and Bill Hutchinson reached into the box and felt around, bringing his hand out at last with the slip of paper in it.\\n\\nThe crowd was quiet.

Harry, you open little Dave\\u2019s.\\u201d\\n\\nMr. Graves opened the slip of paper and there was a general sigh through the crowd as he held it up and everyone could see that it was blank. Nancy and Bill, Jr., opened theirs at the same time, and both beamed and laughed, turning around to the crowd and holding their slips of paper above their heads.\\n\\n\\u201cTessie,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. There was a pause, and then Mr. Summers looked at Bill Hutchinson, and Bill unfolded his paper and showed it. It was blank.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s Tessie,\\u201d Mr. Summers said, and his voice was hushed. \\u201cShow us her paper, Bill.\\u201d\\n\\nBill Hutchinson went over to his wife and forced the slip of paper out of her hand. It had a black spot on it, the black spot Mr. Summers had made the night before with the heavy pencil in the coal-company office. Bill Hutchinson held it up, and there was a stir in the crowd.\\n\\n\\u201cAll right, folks,\\u201d Mr. Summers said. \\u201cLet\\u2019s finish quickly.\\u201d\\n\\nAlthough the villagers had forgotten the ritual and lost the original black box, they still remembered to use stones. The pile of stones the boys had made earlier was ready; there were stones on the ground with the blowing scraps of paper that had come out of the box. Mrs. Delacroix selected a stone so large she had to pick it up with both hands and turned to Mrs. Dunbar. \\u201cCome on,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHurry up.\\u201d\\n\\nMrs. Dunbar had small stones in both hands, and she said, gasping for breath. \\u201cI can\\u2019t run at all. You\\u2019ll have to go ahead and I\\u2019ll catch up with you.\\u201d\\n\\nThe children had stones already, and someone gave little Davy Hutchinson a few pebbles.\\n\\nTessie Hutchinson was in the center of a cleared space by now, and she held her hands out desperately as the villagers moved in on her. \\u201cIt isn\\u2019t fair,\\u201d she said.

You don\\u2019t walk, you creep. Some days you crawl. Others, best just to lie still. The closets are full of ghosts. Blouses she wore when she was twenty-six. A denim skirt. Killer dresses. Shoes\\u2014heels, pumps, a pair of Capezio tap shoes\\u2014entombed in boxes. When you open the closet door her coats hold still, suspecting they\\u2019re gonners. Threads of memory. She wore this one there, that one here. Every garment a chapter. The clothes of the dead have no future. You could burn them. You could leave them be, decades of sartorial history hanging from a pole sagging with the weight of remembrance. You could cross-dress with a vengeance. Everything Must Go. Not discarded, donated. To the Women\\u2019s Shelter, cartons and paper bags and piles of clothes, until the woman behind the counter says they\\u2019re overstocked. You\\u2019re tempted to take them all back. Who denies the donation of a dead woman\\u2019s clothes? The rest to St. Vincent DePaul\\u2019s, and there her cottons and linens and rayon blends are added to bins heaped with corduroy and polyester. (But for one satin nightgown that will not be donated.) Until the closets seem empty. Your clothes don\\u2019t count\\u2014they aren\\u2019t you, but just neglected shirts, pants, and jackets. As summer wanes, you open a drawer and find sweaters, scarves, wool hats and gloves. Gear for a woman who understood winter. You send sweaters and shawls and silk scarves to the women and girls in her family. They respond with photographs of ten year old daughters wrapped in blue for the fifth grade\\u2019s Colonial Day. Still you are possessed by possessions. Even after you dispossess yourself, they turn up in the kitchen drawers and cabinets, where she kept jars of dry goods, beans and grains, future meals. And there, in the freezer, plastic containers: soups, tomato sauce, chili. Nutritional messages from the afterlife. Hoard them. Defrost only as a last resort. Yet through the winter the freezer becomes as spacious and cold as your heart. By the time you open the last tub, labeled Black Bean Chili 3/14/10, food no longer has any meaning. It\\u2019s no longer an act of love, a gesture of kindness. There is no intimacy in tuna salad or in marinating chicken thighs. It\\u2019s embarrassing to recall how often you ate by candlelight; it\\u2019s like the satin nightgown tucked away in a drawer you never open. Instead just heat and serve. Just nuke it. Just eat. Overcooked sustenance. When you eat dinner right out of the skillet or pot, the temptation is to glance over your shoulder in shame. No one is watching, except the cookbooks. Shelves of cookbooks, back issues of Gourmet and Bon Appetit, and a three-ring binder stuffed with recipes, a culinary legacy handed down from grandmother to mother to daughter. Recipes written in her short hand, scrolls and waves and loops fetching across the page with an occasional word, a white cap of English. Instructions for future meals, for candlelight dinners, for guests. There are no recipes now, there are no guests; no need for the wedding china, the good tablecloth. Don\\u2019t forget Widower\\u2019s Rule #1: Never turn down a dinner invitation. You\\u2019re the guest now. And after dinner you walk about the house, speaking to the dark. Go ahead, come back and haunt me. Move the book on the table. Slam the bedroom door. Anything, I\\u2019m ready. Go ahead, I dare you. Scare me to death. I am ready. The reply is the deepest silence. Yet sometimes you feel her in the silence: nothing moves, no hinges creak, no lights flicker. Just her silence. Fuck you, Stephen Spielberg; death has no special effects. There is no possession, just possessions. To break the silence you play music. CDs in horizontal stacks; vertical rows of plastic jewel boxes, never properly alphabetized (as she so often suggested). Songs with melodies, lyrics, choruses, verses, movements, codas. Songs you can\\u2019t live without. Songs you\\u2019ll never listen to again. Songs you know by heart. Songs you want to forget. Songs you can\\u2019t forget. Songs for dinner, for reading, for dancing, for killing a bottle of wine, for making love. Songs to break the silence. Songs against eternal darkness. But one day (maybe) you\\u2019ll make a deal with the silence. You\\u2019ll sit in her grandparents\\u2019 chair and it will only be a chair. Or you could give it away. All of it. Everything. Everything except the stones. She was forever (or so it seemed) gathering beach stones. She\\u2019d return from a beach with her coat pockets sagging, doing her best Virginia Woolf. Round stones, egg-shaped stones, disk-shaped stones, stones ground smooth by water and time. Stones from England, Scotland, Ireland, Italy, Turkey, Cape Cod. Stones stored in shoe boxes, in plastic bags, in bowls; clusters of stones distributed about the house like incense. She liked the look of them, the feel of them, rattling in her palm. You could get rid of it all, but not the stones. You could walk on them, sleep on them, sit on them, eat off of them. Your house would be silent, filled with stones. You would have solitude.

Or better yet: for a boy\\u2014two of them!\\u2014to pass by Ramona\\u2019s house, trying to slouch their shoulders and barely nod while glancing our way. But half of the summer was dead already and neither of those things had happened.\\n\\n\\u201cI thought meeting new people would be hard,\\u201d I said, chewing on my splintered popsicle stick. \\u201cAnd then bam, I met you.\\u201d\\n\\nThis wasn\\u2019t exactly true. I felt the urge to exaggerate things when I was around Ramona. I found myself making up little lies. I was the only person in the entire world who knew about her heart thing. I felt like I owed her something. I had nothing to confess, and so I made things up.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m afraid of being abducted by aliens,\\u201d I lied.\\n\\n\\u201cI shoplifted a bag of peanut M&Ms in the checkout line, standing right next to my mom,\\u201d I lied.\\n\\n\\u201cSheila Hastings is stupid. Her bangs are ugly,\\u201d I lied. \\u201cAnd I kicked her once in the hallway on the way to lunch.\\u201d\\n\\nThat summer, three bad things happened. Matt Gowen\\u2019s dad died of cancer. Tracy Turner\\u2019s dog Velvet got run over by a minivan. And then, at the beginning of August, Troy Benson\\u2019s little brother climbed into the baby pool and started to drown in only a few inches of water. The paramedics had to do CPR, and we all decided he\\u2019d be messed up forever after going through something like that.\\n\\n\\u201cI wonder what it would be like if I started jogging,\\u201d Ramona said one night while we were sitting on her bed, painting our toenails lime green.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s all she said, but I knew exactly what she meant. Some girls our age had started jogging around the neighborhood in packs. It was the girls who had started to develop. They didn\\u2019t jog because it was healthy. They jogged so they could wear tight, neon-colored exercise clothes, the sudden swelling on their chests pushing out against bright elastic, tugging them forward along the streets of our neighborhood and into the rest of their lives. I knew that Ramona wanted to jog and see if her heart would push itself out while she was panting and sputtering. She\\u2019d have a bulge on her little chest then. Who cares if it was only on one side?  Imagine being with a boy, in a basement or a closet, and then that sudden beating on the outside of your chest. Imagine that he wouldn\\u2019t be grossed out at all. Imagine that he\\u2019d let out a moan, some unbelievable sound, because of the way your body was being right there in front of him. Ramona never confessed to any daydreams like that, but I knew she had them. I had them for her.\\n\\nI practically lived at Ramona\\u2019s house that summer. Almost every night I was stretched out there on her bed, waiting for sleep and feeling the humidity press into every part of me like a secret I figured someday I might identify and then maybe understand.\\n\\n\\u201cSee,\\u201d she said the first time she showed me. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like this.\\u201d\\n\\nRamona pulled her tank top up and there it was: a heart beating on the outside of her chest. I didn\\u2019t scream like I thought I would. I didn\\u2019t cover my eyes or gag or laugh uncontrollably. I just looked at it. I nodded my head. \\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said. And then I blinked or glanced at her face, and when I looked again it was already gone. She didn\\u2019t have her bra on. We had each bought the same size and the same style at the beginning of the summer, even though neither of us needed one yet. We hardly wore them when it was just the two of us lazing around her house, waiting for the world to happen. Ramona kept her tank top pulled up even after her heart had disappeared. I stared at her chest. It was creamy and bare and ordinary\\u2014no trace of the bloody, glistening muscle that had been galloping there only seconds before.\\n\\nI miss Ramona. It\\u2019s a simple kind of missing. It\\u2019s the way vague regret and longing pool in your stomach when you shouldn\\u2019t be feeling anything at all\\u2014while pulling laundry out of the washer, while walking the dog, while reaching for something in the shower with your eyes squeezed shut. The two of us were careless and let whatever we had dissolve into a leftover pang of almost-nostalgia. Who knows where she is now?\\n\\n\\u201cTurn your stomach inside out,\\u201d she said one night.\\n\\nI was almost asleep. I opened my eyes up to the dark.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI mean, for real,\\u201d she said. There was that mean, annoyed flip that sometimes came out at the ends of her sentences.\\n\\n\\u201cLike this,\\u201d she said. She turned on the little lamp next to her bed, and her heart was there again, beating and wet against the delicate V of her unbuttoned nightgown. The openings and valves and the whole mess of it sucked at the air like an angry, stranded fish.\\n\\nI think about that heart late at night, my husband pressed here in bed next to me. I try to reach back into my childhood and pin lanky, eleven-year-old Ramona with eating disorders and depression and the hungry, open mouth of loneliness. But really, it was just that thing with her heart. That\\u2019s all. And I\\u2019m jealous. I still do it\\u2014lie here in bed and try to push things outside of myself. I\\u2019m jealous of any woman who has ever given birth. Think of it\\u2014something being forced out like that, gravity or fate or whatever it is pulling away at you like a stubborn, certain thing.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The narrator and her friend, Ramona, spend the summer together, waiting for something exciting to happen. The narrator feels drawn to Ramona because she knows about Ramona's heart condition, which causes her heart to sometimes be on the outside of her skin. As they spend time together, the narrator feels the need to make up lies to feel like she is keeping Ramona's secret.\\n\\nThroughout the summer, three unfortunate events occur: a boy's father dies, a dog gets run over, and a child almost drowns. These events make the girls feel the need to find excitement in their own lives.\\n\\nOne night, Ramona mentions wanting to start jogging, which the narrator understands as a desire to feel her heart push out of her chest. The girls paint their toenails and discuss the possibility of Ramona's heart appearing while exercising.\\n\\nRamona shows the narrator what her heart looks like one night, exposing her chest and revealing her beating heart. The narrator reacts calmly, but feels a sense of longing and nostalgia for their friendship.\\n\\nYears later, the narrator reflects on her memories of Ramona and her heart. She realizes that she still longs for that feeling of pushing something outside of herself, like Ramona's heart on the outside of her body.

Mama says so sometimes.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat is a witch?\\u201d I asked Mama once.\\n\\n\\u201cA witch is an unusual person. They are different from normal people,\\u201d Mama told me.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople call me different. Am I a witch too?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cIdara, you are not a witch, okay?!\\u201d Mama said. \\u201cYou are a kind and sweet little girl and when I\\u2019m done with you, you will be a strong, independent woman,\\u201d she told me, holding my arms as she looked into my eyes, smiling. I smiled too.\\n\\n\\u201cA witch can never be these things,\\u201d she said. \\u201cA witch is a paranormal creature that lives between the shadows cast by daylight. They traverse the infinities of a heartbeat, they sail in seas of dreams\\u2026 they manipulate nature.\\u201d\\n\\nI couldn\\u2019t understand Mama. It seemed to me that witches did wonderful things.\\n\\n\\u201cAbove all else, a witch is evil. Evil for a witch is its own reward,\\u201d she finished. I knew it must be true because Mama never lied.\\n\\nI wondered if Aunty Adesuwa was all these things. I think it was that day my hatred for witches began to take root. I hated how they perverted a thing that would otherwise have been beautiful. I didn\\u2019t know why Mama or anyone hadn\\u2019t stopped Aunty Adesuwa and I didn\\u2019t care to know. I would stop her myself.\\n\\nI once saw Aunty Adesuwa eavesdropping on my mother and two of her friends. I didn\\u2019t know how to signal Mama without her seeing me. My palms became sweaty and my breathing difficult.\\n\\n\\u201cWe all know Adesuwa killed her ex-husband\\u2019s illegitimate child,\\u201d Aunty Bisi, one of Mama\\u2019s friends said. She probably thought she was whispering. She wasn\\u2019t. Aunty Bisi always complained about my clothing to my mom. She had a big nose. I didn\\u2019t like her. As I stood paralyzed by fear, Aunty Adesuwa burst into the meeting. She was all tears and fury.\\n\\n\\u201cI loved that child!\\u201d she screamed. Mama and her friends stared open-mouthed at her.\\n\\n\\u201cAm I the cancer that afflicted him?\\u201d she asked. \\u201cYou\\u2019re all typical weak women! You judge me for leaving a man who was perpetually unfaithful. You judge me for doing well for myself without his help. You blame me for his misfortunes. You blame me for the death of a child whom I loved regardless of the manner of his conception.\\u201d\\n\\nWhile she talked I felt it resonating in my bones. My blood seemed to heat up in my veins as if her words scorched my insides. I wondered if Mama and her friends felt this strangeness. They didn\\u2019t seem to.\\n\\n\\u201cGod will judge all of you\\u201d Aunty Adesuwa said finally, walking away. Days later, I still pondered her words.\\n\\nIt was a sunny day, two weeks after Aunty Adesuwa\\u2019s tirade. I hid in the bushes by her house. Aunty Bisi had come down with a fever. Mama had sent me to give her and her big nose the medicinal pepper soup. I had subliminally taken a route that went past Aunty Adesuwa\\u2019s house when I saw her calling to a teenage boy. He was new in the village. His bicycle seemed worn out. I watched as she offered him a steaming plate of jollof rice and chilled Fanta. I saw a grin split his face. Generally, we were not very hospitable to strangers in our village. Even Mama was downright awful to them. I pondered this as I went to give Aunty Big Nose her pepper soup.\\n\\nThree weeks later I sneaked out of my house at midnight. Mama was sleeping like a log. She had been helping her only friend other than Aunty Bisi, Aunty Uwa with the burial of her son. He had accidently ridden his bicycle off a cliff the day he came visiting from the neighboring village. I wish I had known him.\\n\\nI walked to Aunty Adesuwa\\u2019s house. I had to see the witch in her element. It still pained me that such a fascinating and wondrous thing as magic was used for evil. I hid in the darkness watching aunty Adesuwa\\u2019s house. It was hours before I heard her back door opening. I ran on tip toes to the backyard. I saw Aunty Adesuwa, naked as her name day, striding into the forest. I followed her. It was a long walk. Finally she stepped into a moonlit clearing. As I watched her, I felt a migraine that blurred my sight. In the place where Aunty Adesuwa should have been, there was instead the body of a very large cat with her head still human. Her glowing eyes were looking right at my hidden position in the bushes.\\n\\n\\u201cIdara,\\u201d she hissed.\\n\\nMy heart pounded violently. My whole body shook with trepidation. I steadied myself as best as I could and stepped out with Mama\\u2019s kitchen knife clutched in my trembling hands.\\n\\n\\u201cI hate you,\\u201d I said.\\n\\n\\u201cWhy?\\u201d she purred innocently.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Cause you\\u2019re evil,\\u201d I said.\\n\\n\\u201cAre you certain?\\u201d she asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said, nodding to myself. Mama had told me witches were evil. She had also said Aunty Adesuwa was a witch. Therefore, Aunty Adesuwa was evil.\\n\\n\\u201cI know you\\u2019ve been watching, Idara. Your mother taught you better than to jump to conclusions,\\u201d she chided.\\n\\n\\u201cConsider the facts,\\u201d she said. It was something Mama always said to me that helped me solve riddles.\\n\\n\\u201cThe riddle of witches?\\u201d I asked\\n\\n\\u201dThe riddle of my witchcraft,\\u201d she replied.\\n\\nI pondered thoughts I had kept in the deep recesses of my mind. I was sure witches were evil because Mama never lied. I was sure Aunty Adesuwa was a witch after seeing her transformation but was I sure Aunty Adesuwa was evil?\\n\\nAunty Adesuwa had been kind and sweet to the stranger with the bicycle. She had loved her stepson. She had also shown her strength and independence by leaving her cheating husband and thriving without him. She was also a witch. This was my confusion.\\n\\nMama said a witch could never be these things.\\n\\n\\u201cThings not adding up, yes?\\u201d she asked, amused by my consternation.\\n\\nIt hit me. Aunty Adesuwa must be a good witch. They actually existed! The realization rekindled a forgotten hope of mine.\\n\\n\\u201cWill you teach me to be a good witch like you?\\u201d I asked her.\\n\\nShe purred contentedly. She seemed to have anticipated my response. I suppose I should have been scared. I wasn\\u2019t.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, sweet child. I will teach you to be a witch\\u2026 just like me,\\u201d she said, her tail swinging leisurely behind her.\\n\\n\\u201cThank you, Aunty,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nShe stalked away into the deep foliage gesturing me to follow with her tail.\\n\\nAs I followed, I thought of Mama. Mama never lied but she was human. She could make mistakes. She didn\\u2019t know about good witches. I thought about how I would make her proud. I would show her the beauty I had only ever seen in my sea of dreams.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story revolves around a young girl named Idara who believes her Aunt Adesuwa is a witch because her mother insists on it sometimes.

We didn\\u2019t know each other. We took her car and headed to Missouri from Chicago. I remember that by the time we\\u2019d gone a few miles south on the Stevenson we\\u2019d already run out of things to say. But, for some reason, we both decided, without spelling it out, not to push it. Nothing was going to come of this, of us, we had hours to go, and it was all right just to let the silence be and listen to the radio. We were on our way to a s\\u00e9ance she\\u2019d heard about from an old high-school friend. She\\u2019d grown up in a small town southwest of St. Louis, and the s\\u00e9ance was being held nearby, at an abandoned air-force base.\\n\\nWe\\u2019d met a couple of nights before. Beth had come into the restaurant near the Loop where I waited tables, and had written her number on a napkin. \\u201cCall me,\\u201d she\\u2019d ordered. A couple of nights later, over drinks, she told me that she wasn\\u2019t the kind of person who ordered people to call her. Something about my face had said that I needed to be told what to do. That was also when she mentioned that this s\\u00e9ance was happening at 2:00 A.M. near St. Louis. If we left right away, she said, we could probably make it. The fact that we both had to be at work the next day made it all the more spontaneous and awesome. We headed out into the night exalted, until, like I said, our conversation dried up completely. It was as if the intrepid adventure were already over and now we just had a shitlong ride ahead of us, which we did.\\n\\nWhen I woke up, we were already past St. Louis and Beth had turned off onto a narrow two-lane highway that cut through a forest. We drove another hour and a half before we reached the base. As per her friend\\u2019s instructions, we ditched the car beneath a stand of trees. Beth didn\\u2019t need any help climbing the fence. She practically leapt over it, and I had to sprint to catch up with her as she strode along the ghost streets, past rows of empty barracks.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the hurry?\\u201d I said. \\u201cEverybody\\u2019s already dead.\\u201d No answer. When we got to Hangar 32, the s\\u00e9ance had already begun. About a dozen people were standing in a circle holding hands. At the center of the circle was a flower pot. Two people unclasped their hands to allow Beth and me to join. A bearded guy in a black watch cap was mumbling with authority. I admit that at first I found the whole thing mesmerizing. Coming upon this group in the darkness of that enormous hangar, the man chanting, the single flame flowing shadows onto the corrugated walls. There was something weirdly sacred about it all, and I thought, Right, if you want to commune with the dead, of course what you have to do is drive across the night to Missouri.\\n\\nBut, after half an hour, forty-five minutes, I began to understand just how fucking cold I was. It was mid-March and I hadn\\u2019t dressed for it. You want to dress lightly on a first date to demonstrate how free and easy-going you are. The dude was still mumbling, and I waited for something, anything, to happen, while softly stamping my feet on the crumbling pavement to warm them up. I was about to whisper to Beth, whose hand I was holding, \\u201cYo, why don\\u2019t we blow this popsicle stand and get some fucking breakfast?,\\u201d when somebody new began shouting. \\u201cMarina? Is that you, Marina?\\u201d Then other people were speaking, too. \\u201cLarry, tell your sister I\\u2019m onto her games.\\u201d \\u201cHow many years did you think you could hide in plain sight, Ramon?\\u201d Even Beth got into it: \\u201cYou never loved me, not a day, not an hour, not a second of a single minute\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nEverybody was speaking at once, and I had trouble discerning individual words in the chaos of voices. And it was ridiculous, it was beyond ridiculous, but it also wasn\\u2019t ridiculous. Shouts in the dark. Maybe that\\u2019s the best we can do to reach beyond ourselves. I tried to join in, too, but I could sense none of my dead, and I couldn\\u2019t, for the life of me, think of anything to just spout out. So I bought it, but at the same time, by that point, I was just trying to live through it, I was so cold. Then the candle went out and our leader broke ranks and swooped down to relight it, but his lighter jammed. We all stopped speaking and began patting down our pockets for a lighter or matches. But our leader shouted at us, \\u201cNo! Don\\u2019t break the membrane! Re-bond!\\u201d\\n\\nWe never quite got back on track after that. The collective spirit or belief or whatever it was escaped from us, and, though our leader mumbled for another half an hour, only a few people spoke up. The guy next to me, a guy I\\u2019d been holding hands with for almost two hours without getting a look at his face, actually made a joke. At least, I thought it was a joke. He said something about the temperature of coffee in hell. I laughed out loud. No one else did. That pretty much ended it. Before we left, Beth went up to the leader and gave him a kiss on the lips that wasn\\u2019t a friend\\u2019s kiss, not by a long stretch. In the car, I asked her who she\\u2019d reached. She said she didn\\u2019t want to talk about it.\\n\\n\\u201cSo you and the dude\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat was nothing. O.K.?\\u201d\\n\\nWe settled back into the silence of the drive. No radio now, just the drone of the engine, which you don\\u2019t hear unless you listen for it, and then it\\u2019s there all the time. It was getting toward dawn, and the dark was giving way to gray. I\\u2019ve always loved that early-morning gloom. I was about to say as much, to try to chip away at the silence, when I noticed that the car had begun to drift into the oncoming lane. Beth had fallen asleep. I don\\u2019t know why but, instead of grabbing the wheel, I seized her shoulder. She woke up but didn\\u2019t seem to realize what was happening and immediately stomped on the brakes. We jolted forward, skidded, and stopped. Headlights were approaching out of the gray. I had time for only one thing. I opened my door, got out, ran off the road into the trees, and waited for the headlights to slam into Beth.\\n\\nThey didn\\u2019t. The other driver saw her in time and fishtailed around her and stopped. For a few moments, everything was still. Then I heard the birds in the trees. I walked back out to the road. The guy rolled down the window of his truck. He looked at Beth in her car; he looked at me. Then he drove away, as if some lovers\\u2019 spat weren\\u2019t worth anything he might have mustered up to say. My door was still open. Beth was calm, motionless, her hands still gripping the wheel.\\n\\nWhen something happens, for better or for worse it\\u2019s happened. It has a before. It has an after. Maybe you can talk about it. Maybe you can\\u2019t. But what about something that almost happens? What almost happens repeats itself. I\\u2019ve come to believe this as a kind of personal gospel.

He hovered over us as we poured ketchup saying: good enough good enough good enough. Birthday parties consisted of cupcakes, no ice cream. The first time I brought a date over she said: what's with your dad and that pole? and I sat there blinking.\\n\\nWe left home, married,  had children of our own, found the seeds of meanness blooming also within us. Dad began dressing the pole with more complexity and less discernible logic. He draped some kind of fur over it on Groundhog Day and lugged out a floodlight to ensure a shadow. When an earthquake struck Chile he lay the pole on its side and spray painted a rift in the earth. Mom died and he dressed the pole as Death and hung from the crossbar photos of Mom as a baby. We'd stop by and find odd talismans from his youth arranged around the base: army medals, theater tickets, old sweatshirts, tubes of Mom's makeup. One autumn he painted the pole bright yellow. He covered it with cotton swabs that winter for warmth and provided offspring by hammering in six crossed sticks around the yard. He ran lengths of string between the pole and the sticks, and taped to the string letters of apology, admissions of error, pleas for understanding, all written in a frantic hand on index cards. He painted a sign saying LOVE and hung it from the pole and another that said FORGIVE? and then he died in the hall with the radio on and we sold the house to a young couple who yanked out the pole and the sticks and left them by the road on garbage day.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story revolves around a family's tradition of dressing up a pole in their yard for various occasions throughout the year. The protagonist recalls how every Thanksgiving, their father would dress the pole as Santa Claus. For Super Bowl week, it would wear a jersey and a helmet, and for other holidays like the Fourth of July, Veterans Day, and Halloween, the pole would be dressed accordingly.\\n\\nThe protagonist reflects on their father's strict and joyless demeanor, describing how they were only allowed to use one crayon at a time and were criticized for wasting food. Birthday parties were simple, with only cupcakes and no ice cream. The protagonist also shares an incident where a date questioned their father's obsession with the pole, leaving them confused.\\n\\nAs time passes, the children grow up, get married, and have their own families, but they find themselves inheriting their father's mean streak. Meanwhile, their father's decorations for the pole become more complex and less logical. After their mother's death, he dresses the pole as Death and hangs photos of her as a baby. He starts collecting various items from his youth and arranges them around the base of the pole. At one point, he paints the pole yellow and covers it with cotton swabs for warmth.\\n\\nIn the protagonist's final memory, their father tapes index cards with heartfelt messages to strings tied between the pole and sticks in the yard. Apologies, admissions of error, and pleas for understanding are written in a frantic hand. The father then paints two signs, one saying \\\"LOVE\\\" and the other \\\"FORGIVE?\\\". Sadly, the father dies alone in the hallway with the radio on, and the family sells the house to a young couple. They remove the pole and sticks, discarding them on garbage day.\\n\\nThe story explores the themes of tradition, family dynamics, and the complexities of human emotions. It suggests a cycle of meanness within the family, possibly passed down from generation to generation. The unconventional tradition of dressing up the pole becomes a reflection of the father's inner turmoil and his desperate attempts to seek love and forgiveness.

Despite the imaginative transformations of the pole, it appeared to be the father's only source of joy.\\n\\nIn this severely frugal house, the children were only allowed one Crayola crayon at a time, wasting food was strictly prohibited, and celebrations were modest, like cupcakes instead of a full birthday cake. One time when the protagonist brought a date home, they questioned the purpose of the pole, and the protagonist had no satisfying answer.\\n\\nAs the children grew up and moved out, they too developed selfish and unkind tendencies. Meanwhile, the father continued his eccentric display with the pole, adding more complexity and unusual items based on unclear rules. When the mother passed away, the father symbolically dressed the pole as Death and attached pictures of their mother. Upon visiting, the children discovered various memorabilia from their father's past arranged around the pole.\\n\\nIn new acts of strangeness, the father painted the pole yellow in one season and covered it with cotton swabs in another for warmth. He went on to create offspring for the pole by hammering in six sticks with lengths of string tied to them.

Whenever children use blue paint, tiny particles of it dissolve from their hands into the air and color it blue.  Over time the pigment fades, but as long as there is fingerpainting, there will always be blue sky.\\n\\nAnother answer is related to the blue-eyed creatures at the North and South Poles.  They are always looking up into the sky, and the blue of their eyes reflects back for the whole world to see.  You\\u2019ve probably never heard of these polar creatures because they know how to hide from satellites and explorers.  The reflection of their eyes is all we\\u2019ll ever see of them.\\n\\nBut the answer I think is true right now concerns angels and blueberries. \\n\\nYou see, blueberries are the angels\\u2019 favorite food.  There\\u2019s nothing they like more; and berries are healthy, so it\\u2019s a happy coincidence.  The only problem is, angels are sloppy eaters, and they eat pretty much all day. Of course they do other things like play the harp and sing and keep little babies from getting into the bleach under the sink. But they still have lots of time to munch on blueberries\\u2014they live forever, after all\\u2014so little bits of blueberry wind up all over the sky.\\n\\nEven worse, some angels don\\u2019t like the blueberry skins, so they peel each berry before eating it and toss the skins to the side.  This doesn\\u2019t make them blatant litterers, mind you\\u2014they know they\\u2019ll get around to picking up the skins, just not at that very moment.\\n\\nSo as the day goes on, the angels eat more and more berries; and as the sun goes down, its light reflects through the berry pulp and juice, creating wonderful reds and oranges and yellows.  And still the angels eat, and the sky grows darker and darker with blue skins and bits of berry.  The angels keep on munching until, with the exception of little gaps for the moon and stars, no light can get to the Earth at all.  In fact, there\\u2019s not even enough room for the moon most of the time, which is why you only see the whole thing once a month.\\n\\nIn the middle of the night God finally has enough, and she tells the angels they have to start cleaning up their mess.  Of course they start right away, but it\\u2019s a big mess and it takes a while.  And as they clean, you can see a little bits of light start to penetrate the layer of blueberry waste.  Dawn begins as they wipe and scrub, and daylight breaks when they finally clear away enough blueberries for the sun to shine on the Earth again. \\n\\nThe one problem is that blueberry skins stain, and the angels can\\u2019t scrub the traces away completely.  Some days they do better, and the sky is light blue.  But on very sunny days you can see the full extent of the staining and the sky is a rich, dark blue.  But God isn\\u2019t that concerned about the stains.  She actually thinks they\\u2019re pretty, and the renters down on the surface don\\u2019t mind, and she\\u2019s not planning on moving anytime soon, so it\\u2019s not like she has to worry about resale value.  What matters to her is that the angels did their best.\\n\\nNow, you may wonder what would happen if the angels ever got tired of blueberries.  What would happen if they switched to raspberries?  Would the sky eventually wind up purple?  If they started eating bananas, would the yellow peels turn the blue sky green?  Or if they developed a fondness for lemons, would the juice bleach the color out forever?  And if that happened, would your grandchildren ever believe the sky had once been blue? \\n\\nOr would they just think you were a silly writer telling stories about angels and blueberries?\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story is a whimsical and imaginative explanation of why the sky is blue. The narrator presents multiple fantastical explanations, each with its own unique twist.\\n\\nFirstly, the narrator suggests that the blue color of the sky comes from the particles of blue fingerpaint that children dissolve into the air when they use it. This idea implies that as long as there is fingerpainting, the sky will always be blue.\\n\\nNext, the narrator introduces the concept of blue-eyed creatures at the North and South Poles. These creatures constantly look up at the sky, and the blue reflection from their eyes is what gives the sky its color. These creatures are said to be elusive and skilled at hiding from satellites and explorers.\\n\\nThe third explanation revolves around angels and blueberries. The narrator claims that blueberries are the favorite food of angels. However, angels are messy eaters, and as they eat blueberries all day, tiny bits of the fruit end up in the sky. The angels also discard the berry skins, which contributes to the blue mess in the sky. When the sky becomes dark with blueberry remnants, God commands the angels to clean up their mess. As they scrub away the blueberry waste, bits of light start to penetrate the sky, and dawn breaks when enough blueberries are cleared for the sun to shine on the Earth again.\\n\\nThe story emphasizes that despite the stains left behind by blueberry skins, God finds them beautiful and does not mind the marks on the sky. The narrator poses the question of what would happen if the angels decided to eat something other than blueberries, implying that the sky's color could potentially change based on their food preferences. However, these further explanations are left to the imagination.\\n\\nThroughout the story, the narrator suggests that different people may have different answers to why the sky is blue, depending on their perspective or creativity. The story encourages a sense of wonder and imagination, leaving the readers to contemplate their own interpretations of the sky.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"In this whimsical and imaginative story, the narrator provides various answers to the question of why the sky is blue. The answers range from scientific explanations to creative explanations involving fictional creatures and objects. Each response represents a different approach and perspective. \\n\\nThe story starts by acknowledging that an adult's answer to the question is scientific and technical, explaining how light interacts with air particles to create the color blue. The narrative then transitions into imaginative responses. First, it suggests that the color blue in the sky comes from the particles of blue fingerpaint that dissolve into the air when children use it. This theory claims that the constant fingerpainting of children always ensures a blue sky.\\n\\nThe narrative further expresses that the skies could be blue because of blue-eyed creatures living at the poles. These creatures remain hidden from human explorers and spy satellites, but their blue eyes contribute to the sky's color. They act as mirrors, reflecting the blue of their eyes into the atmosphere.\\n\\nTowards the end, the story's conclusion settles on the idea that the blueberries angels consume creates the blue hue of the atmospheric sky. The angels, who are attributed with various duties, enjoy snacking on blueberries throughout eternity. As they eat, stray bits of blueberry go all over the sky; their purple juice creates the warm tones seen during sunset. Eventually, their meal debris becomes so extensive that it obstructs any light reaching the Earth, resulting in nighttime.\\n\\nGod, seeing enough of this mess, instructs the angels to clean up. Thus, they tirelessly scrub and wipe away the blueberry remnants, allowing daylight to reemerge for humans to enjoy once again. They cannot, however, removed all the stains, leading to variations in the appearance of the sky, depending on the sunlight. God, unconcerned about the staining, appreciates their effort and the beauty it brings to the sky.\\n\\nThe story concludes by playfully pondering about potential scenarios in which the angels switch their fruit preference, humorously speculating how different fruits might alter the sky's color. Ultimately, the story leaves readers with the question of whether individuals who hear and believe these stories and explanations might be seen as silly storytellers themselves.\", \"story_token_count\": 1087, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 470, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 529}, {\"Title\": \"BABY DOLLS\", \"Author\": \"Becky Robison\", \"story\": \"My mother isn\\u2019t always Raggedy Ann, but she was when I was born.

They explain that she is not always like this, but she was when they were born. The narrator recounts a Halloween office party that took place in Richard Nixon's basement apartment. Their mother, dressed as Raggedy Ann, sipped on Shirley Temples while the narrator's fists pummeled her beneath her thrift-store jumper.\\n\\nThe narrator expresses their dislike for grenadine, the sweet syrup in the Shirley Temples, but understands that Raggedy Ann, being a doll, would not know this. Their mother, young and inebriated, laughed along with the other guests as fluid dampened her striped stockings. Everyone found humor in the situation because she was dressed as a doll.\\n\\nA cat with a tail longer than Raggedy Ann's skirt eventually lays her in the bathtub and closes the moldy curtain, leaving her limbs limp. People continue to use the nearby restroom, while the red yarn on her head, soaked with sweat, remains, as Raggedy Ann is loyal and true.\\n\\nThe narrator reveals that only they were able to bring Raggedy Ann to life. Each shock they delivered while inside their mother's womb transformed Raggedy Ann's soft body into bone and blood, carving chambers into her two-dimensional valentine heart.\\n\\nThe story seems to depict a symbolic and metaphorical representation of the narrator's relationship with their mother. Raggedy Ann serves as a unique character symbolizing both innocence and vulnerability. The narrative suggests a complex and complicated connection between the narrator and their mother, exploring themes of loyalty, transformation, and the impact of one's existence on others.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"The narrator starts by narrating the state of their mother as Raggedy Ann, a doll-like figure, had been blurry or hazy to some extent before they were born. It is hinted that their mother may not have been in her right mind due to being under the influence of drugs or alcohol when she became pregnant. The story then revolves around a Halloween office party that took place at Richard Nixon's basement apartment.\\n\\nAt the party, the narrator's mother is depicted as a young woman, dressed as Raggedy Ann, and partakes in indulgent behavior by occasionally drinking Shirley Temples. Meanwhile, the narrator describes the strangeness of their early existence as they communicate with their jelly-like fists from within their mother's womb during the event. The narrator also inadvertently dislikes the taste of grenadine, which is present in the Shirley Temples.\\n\\nThe party guests, presumably intoxicated or under the influence, engage in lively and chaotic behavior causing amusement. As a result, when the mother's water breaks and dampens her striped stockings, the raucous laughter fills the room, including the mother joining in on the lighthearted response to the situation.\\n\\nFollowing this, a cat who seemingly possesses a disproportionately long tail to the length of the mother's skirt appears and carries the doll-like Raggedy Ann figure into the bathroom, shutting the moldy curtain on them both. Despite the mother's unconsciousness, people continue to urinate near the bathtub Non-low withstanding, Raggedy Ann's appearance remains delineated, with her yarn hair basking in sweat and her body still entirely limp, showcasing her steadfast loyalty to the narrator.\\n\\nFinally, the story concludes with the notion that it is essentially the narrator's life force that breathes life into the otherwise motionless Raggedy Ann.

His mother thought he was too.

B\\u2019lieve it all you wants tuh, but dontcha tell mah son none of it.\\u201d\\n\\nPerhaps ten-year-old John was puzzling to the simple folk there in the Florida woods for he was an imaginative child and fond of day-dreams. The St. John River flowed a scarce three hundred feet from his back door. On its banks at this point grow numerous palms, luxuriant magnolias and bay trees with a dense undergrowth of ferns, cat-tails and rope-grass. On the bosom of the stream float millions of delicately colored hyacinths. The little brown boy loved to wander down to the water\\u2019s edge, and, casting in dry twigs, watch them sail away down stream to Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world and John Redding wanted to follow them.\\n\\nSometimes in his dreams he was a prince, riding away in a gorgeous carriage. Often he was a knight bestride a fiery charger prancing down the white shell road that led to distant lands. At other times he was a steamboat captain piloting his craft down the St. John River to where the sky seemed to touch the water. No matter what he dreamed or who he fancied himself to be, he always ended by riding away to the horizon; for in his childish ignorance he thought this to be farthest land.\\n\\nBut these twigs, which John called his ships, did not always sail away. Sometimes they would be swept in among the weeds growing in the shallow water, and be held there. One day his father came upon him scolding the weeds for stopping his sea-going vessels.\\n\\n\\u201cLet go mah ships! You ole mean weeds you!\\u201d John screamed and stamped impotently. \\u201cThey wants tuh go \\u2019way. You let \\u2019em go on!\\u201d\\n\\nAlfred laid his hand on his son\\u2019s head lovingly. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s mattah, son?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMah ships, pa,\\u201d the child answered weeping. \\u201cAh throwed \\u2019em in to go way off an\\u2019 them ole weeds won\\u2019t let \\u2019em.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, well, doan cry.

Ah talks in parables sometimes. Come on, les go on tuh supper.\\u201d\\n\\nAlf took his son\\u2019s hand, and started slowly toward the house.

When you gits biggah you won\\u2019t think of sich.\\u201d\\n\\nHand in hand the two trudged across the plowed land and up to the house, the child dreaming of the days when he should wander to far countries, and the man of the days when he might have\\u2014and thus they entered the kitchen.\\n\\nMatty Redding, John\\u2019s mother, was setting the table for supper. She was a small wiry woman with large eyes that might have been beautiful when she was young, but too much weeping had left them watery and weak.\\n\\n\\u201cMatty,\\u201d Alf began as he took his place at the table, \\u201cdontcha know our boy is different from any othah chile roun\\u2019 heah. He \\u2019lows he\\u2019s goin\\u2019 to sea when he gits grown, an\\u2019 Ah reckon Ah\\u2019ll let \\u2019im.\\u201d\\n\\nThe woman turned from the stove, skillet in hand. \\u201cAlf, you ain\\u2019t gone crazy, is you?

He kain\\u2019t help wantin\\u2019 tuh go cause he\\u2019s a man chile!\\u201d\\n\\nMrs. Redding promptly went off into a fit of weeping but the man and boy ate supper unmoved. Twelve years of married life had taught Alfred that far from being miserable when she wept, his wife was enjoying a bit of self-pity.\\n\\nThus John Redding grew to manhood, playing, studying and dreaming. He attended the village school as did most of the youth about him, but he also went to high school at the county seat where none of the villagers went. His father shared his dreams and ambitions, but his mother could not understand why he should wish to go strange places where neither she nor his father had been. No one of their community had ever been farther away than Jacksonville. Few indeed had ever been there. Their own gardens, general store, and occasional trips to the county seat\\u2014seven miles away\\u2014sufficed for all their needs. Life was simple indeed with these folk.\\n\\nJohn was the subject of much discussion among the country folk. Why didn\\u2019t he teach school instead of thinking about strange places and people? Did he think himself better than any of the \\u201cgals\\u201d there about that he would not go a-courting any of them? He must be \\u201cfixed\\u201d as his mother claimed, else where did his queer notions come from? Well, he was always queer, and one could not expect the man to be different from the child. They never failed to stop work at the approach of Alfred in order to be at the fence and inquire after John\\u2019s health and ask when he expected to leave.\\n\\n\\u201cOh,\\u201d Alfred would answer. \\u201cJes\\u2019 as soon as his mah gits reconciled to th\\u2019 notion. He\\u2019s a mighty dutiful boy, mah John is. He doan wanna hurt her feelings.\\u201d\\n\\nThe boy had on several occasions attempted to reconcile his mother to the notion, but found it a difficult task. Matty always took refuge in self-pity and tears. Her son\\u2019s desires were incomprehensible to her, that was all. She did not want to hurt him. It was love, mother love, that made her cling so desperately to John.\\n\\n\\u201cLawd knows,\\u201d she would sigh, \\u201cAh nevah wuz happy an\\u2019 nevah specks tuh be.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAn\\u2019 from yo\\u2019 actions,\\u201d put in Alfred hotly, \\u201cyou\\u2019s determined not to be.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThas right, Alfred, go on an\\u2019 \\u2019buse me. You allus does. Ah knows Ah\\u2019m ign\\u2019rant an\\u2019 all dat, but dis is mah son. Ah bred an\\u2019 born \\u2019im. He kain\\u2019t help from wantin\\u2019 to go rovin\\u2019 cause travel dust been put down fuh him. But mebbe we kin cure \\u2019im by disincouragin\\u2019 the idee.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, Ah wants mah son tuh go; an\\u2019 he wants tuh go too. He\\u2019s a man now, Matty. An\\u2019 we mus\\u2019 let John hoe his own row. If it\\u2019s travelin\\u2019 twon\\u2019t be foh long. He\\u2019ll come back to us bettah than when he went off. What do you say, son?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMamma,\\u201d John began slowly, \\u201cit hurts me to see you so troubled over my going away; but I feel that I must go. I\\u2019m stagnating here. This indolent atmosphere will stifle every bit of ambition that\\u2019s in me. Let me go mamma, please. What is there here for me? Why, sometimes I get to feeling just like a lump of dirt turned over by the plow\\u2014just where it falls there\\u2019s where it lies\\u2014no thought or movement or nothing. I wanter make myself something\\u2014not just stay where I was born.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNaw, John, it\\u2019s bettah for you to stay heah and take over the school. Why don\\u2019t you marry and settle down?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to, mamma. I want to go away.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell,\\u201d said Mrs. Redding, pursing her mouth tightly, \\u201cyou ainta goin\\u2019 wid mah consent!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry mamma, that you won\\u2019t consent. I am going nevertheless.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJohn, John, mah baby! You wouldn\\u2019t kill yo\\u2019 po\\u2019 ole mamma, would you? Come, kiss me, son.\\u201d\\n\\nThe boy flung his arms about his mother and held her closely while she sobbed on his breast. To all of her pleas, however, he answered that he must go.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ll stay at home this year, mamma, then I\\u2019ll go for a while, but it won\\u2019t be long. I\\u2019ll come back and make you and papa oh so happy. Do you agree, mamma dear?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh reckon tain\\u2019 nothin\\u2019 tall fuh me to do else.\\u201d\\n\\nThings went on very well around the Redding home for some time. During the day John helped his father about the farm and read a great deal at night.\\n\\nThen the unexpected happened. John married Stella Kanty, a neighbor\\u2019s daughter. The courtship was brief but ardent\\u2014on John\\u2019s part at least. He danced with Stella at a candy-pulling, walked with her home and in three weeks had declared himself. Mrs. Redding declared that she was happier than she had ever been in her life. She therefore indulged in a whole afternoon of weeping. John\\u2019s change was occasioned possibly by the fact that Stella was really beautiful; he was young and red-blooded, and the time was spring.\\n\\nSpring-time in Florida is not a matter of peeping violets or bursting buds merely. It is a riot of color in nature\\u2014glistening green leaves, pink, blue, purple, yellow blossoms that fairly stagger the visitor from the north. The miles of hyacinths lie like an undulating carpet on the surface of the river and divide reluctantly when the slow-moving alligators push their way log-like across. The nights are white nights for the moon shines with dazzling splendor, or in the absence of that goddess, the soft darkness creeps down laden with innumerable scents. The heavy fragrance of magnolias mingled with the delicate sweetness of jasmine and wild roses.\\n\\nIf time and propinquity conquered John, what then? These forces have overcome older men.\\n\\nThe raptures of the first few weeks over, John began to saunter out to the gate to gaze wistfully down the white dusty road; or to wander again to the river as he had done in childhood. To be sure he did not send forth twig-ships any longer, but his thoughts would in spite of himself, stray down river to Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world\\u2014and poor home-tied John Redding wanted to follow them.\\n\\nHe grew silent and pensive. Matty accounted for this by her ever-ready explanation of \\u201cconjuration.\\u201d Alfred said nothing but smoked and puttered about the barn more than ever. Stella accused her husband of indifference and made his life miserable with tears, accusations and pouting. At last John decided to bring matters to a head and broached the subject to his wife.\\n\\n\\u201cStella, dear, I want to go roving about the world for a spell. Would you stay here with papa and mamma and wait for me to come back?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJohn, is you crazy sho\\u2019 nuff? If you don\\u2019t want me, say so an\\u2019 I kin go home to mah folks.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStella, darling, I do want you, but I want to go away too. I can have both if you\\u2019ll let me. We\\u2019ll be so happy when I return . . .\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNaw, John, you kain\\u2019t rush me off one side like that. You didn\\u2019t hafta marry me. There\\u2019s a plenty othahs that would have been glad enuff tuh get me; you know Ah wan\\u2019t educated befo\\u2019 han\\u2019.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t make me too conscious of my weakness, Stella. I know I should never have married with my inclinations, but it\\u2019s done now, no use to talk about what is past. I love you and want to keep you, but I can\\u2019t stifle that longing for the open road, rolling seas, for peoples and countries I have never seen. I\\u2019m suffering too, Stella, I\\u2019m paying for my rashness in marrying before I was ready. I\\u2019m not trying to shirk my duty\\u2014you\\u2019ll be well taken care of in the meanwhile.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJohn, folks allus said youse queer and tol\\u2019 me not to marry yuh, but Ah jes\\u2019 loved yuh so Ah couldn\\u2019t help it, an\\u2019 now to think you wants tuh sneak off an\\u2019 leave me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut I\\u2019m coming back, darling . . . listen Stella.\\u201d\\n\\nBut the girl would not. Matty came in and Stella fell into her arms weeping. John\\u2019s mother immediately took up arms against him. The two women carried on such an effective war against him for the next few days that finally Alfred was forced to take his son\\u2019s part.\\n\\n\\u201cMatty, let dat boy alone, Ah tell you! Ef he wuz uh homebuddy he\\u2019d be drove \\u2019way by you all\\u2019s racket.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, Alf, dat\\u2019s all we po\\u2019 wimmen kin do. We wants our husbands an\\u2019 our sons. John\\u2019s got uh wife now, an\\u2019 he ain\\u2019t got no business to be talkin\\u2019 \\u2019bout goin\\u2019 nowheres. I \\u2019lowed dat marryin\\u2019 Stella would settle him.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYas, dat\\u2019s all you wimmen study \\u2019bout \\u2014settlin\\u2019 some man. You takes all de get-up out of \\u2019em. Jes\\u2019 let uh fellah mak uh motion lak gettin\\u2019 somewhere, an\\u2019 some \\u2019oman\\u2019ll begin tuh hollah, \\u2018Stop theah! where\\u2019s you goin\\u2019? Don\\u2019t fuhgit you b\\u2019longs tuh me.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy Gawd! Alf! Whut you reckon Stella\\u2019s gwine do? Let John walk off an\\u2019 leave huh?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNaw, git outer huh foolishness an\\u2019 go \\u2019long wid him. He\\u2019d take huh.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStella ain\\u2019t got no call tuh go crazy \\u2019cause John is. She ain\\u2019t no woman tuh be floppin\\u2019 roun\\u2019 from place tuh place lak some uh dese reps follerin\\u2019 uh section gang.\\u201d\\n\\nThe man turned abruptly from his wife and stood in the kitchen door. A blue haze hung over the river and Alfred\\u2019s attention seemed fixed upon this. In reality his thoughts were turned inward. He was thinking of the numerous occasions upon which he and his son had sat on the fallen log at the edge of the water and talked of John\\u2019s proposed travels. He had encouraged his son, given him every advantage his own poor circumstances would permit. And now John was home-tied.\\n\\nThe young man suddenly turned the corner of the house and approached his father.\\n\\n\\u201cHello, papa.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2019Lo, son.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere\\u2019s mamma and Stella?\\u201d\\n\\nThe older man merely jerked his thumb toward the interior of the house and once more gazed pensively toward the river. John entered the kitchen and kissed his mother fondly.\\n\\n\\u201cGreat news, mamma.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat now?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGot a chance to join the Navy, mamma, and go all around the world.

I know how both of you feel, but I know how I feel, also. You preach to me the gospel of self-sacrifice for the happiness of others, but you are unwilling to practice any of it yourself. Stella can stay here\\u2014I am going to support her and spend all the time I can with her. I am going\\u2014that\\u2019s settled, but I want to go with your good will. I want to do something worthy of a strong man. I have done nothing so far but look to you and papa for everything. Let me learn to strive and think\\u2014in short, be a man.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNaw, John, Ah\\u2019ll nevah give mah consent. I know yous hard-headed jes\\u2019 lak yo\\u2019 paw; but if you leave dis place ovah mah head, Ah nevah wants you tuh come back heah no mo. Ef Ah wuz laid on de coolin\\u2019 board, Ah doan want yuh standin\\u2019 ovah me, young man. Doan even come neah mah grave, you ongrateful wretch!\\u201d\\n\\nMrs. Redding arose and flung out of the room. For once, she was too incensed to cry. John stood in his tracks, gone cold and numb at his mother\\u2019s pronouncement. Alfred, too, was moved. Mrs. Redding banged the bed-room door violently and startled John slightly. Alfred took his son\\u2019s arm, saying softly: \\u201cCome, son, let\\u2019s go down to the river.\\u201d\\n\\nAt the water\\u2019s edge they halted for a short space before seating themselves on the log. The sun was setting in a purple cloud. Hundreds of mosquito hawks darted here and there, catching gnats and being themselves caught by the lightning-swift bullbats. John abstractly snapped in two the stalk of a slender young bamboo. Taking no note of what he was doing, he broke it into short lengths and tossed them singly into the stream. The old man watched him silently for a while, but finally he said: \\u201cOh, yes, my boy, some ships get tangled in the weeds.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, papa, they certainly do. I guess I\\u2019m beaten\\u2014might as well surrender.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNevah say die. Yuh nevah kin tell what will happen.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat can happen? I have courage enough to make things happen; but what can I do against mamma! What man wants to go on a long journey with his mother\\u2019s curses ringing in his ears? She doesn\\u2019t understand. I\\u2019ll wait another year, but I am going because I must.\\u201d\\n\\nAlfred threw an arm about his son\\u2019s neck and drew him nearer but quickly removed it. Both men instantly drew apart, ashamed for having been so demonstrative. The father looked off to the woodlot and asked with a reminiscent smile: \\u201cSon, do you remember showin\\u2019 me the tree dat looked lak a skeleton head?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, I do. It\\u2019s there still. I look at it sometimes when things have become too painful for me at the house, and I run down here to cool off and think. And every time I look at it, papa, it laughs at me like it had some grim joke up its sleeve.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYuh wuz always imaginin\\u2019 things, John; things that nobody else evah thought on!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou know, papa, sometimes\\u2014I reckon my longing to get away makes me feel this way. . . . I feel that I am just earth, soil lying helpless to move myself, but thinking. I seem to hear herds of big beasts like horses and cows thundering over me, and rains beating down; and winds sweeping furiously over\\u2014all acting upon me, but me, well, just soil, feeling but not able to take part in it all. Then a soft wind like love passes over and warms me, and a summer rain comes down like understanding and softens me, and I push a blade of grass or a flower, or maybe a pine tree\\u2014that\\u2019s the ground thinking. Plants are ground thoughts, because the soil can\\u2019t move itself. Whenever I see little whirls of dust sailing down the road I always step aside\\u2014don\\u2019t want to stop \\u2019em \\u2019cause they\\u2019re on their shining way\\u2014moving! Oh, yes, I\\u2019m a dreamer. . . . I have such wonderfully complete dreams, papa. They never come true. But even as my dreams fade I have others.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYas, son, Ah have them same feelings exactly, but Ah can\\u2019t find no words lak you do. It seems lak you an\\u2019 me see wid de same eyes, hear wid de same ears an\\u2019 even feel de same inside. Only thing you kin talk it an\\u2019 Ah can\\u2019t. But anyhow you speaks for me, so whut\\u2019s the difference?\\u201d\\n\\nThe men arose without more conversation. Possibly they feared to trust themselves to speech. As they walked leisurely toward the house Alfred remarked the freshness of the breeze.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s about time the rains set in,\\u201d added his son. \\u201cThe year is wearin\\u2019 on.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter a gloomy supper John strolled out into the spacious front yard and seated himself beneath a China-berry tree. The breeze had grown a trifle stronger since sunset and continued from the south-east. Matty and Stella sat on the deep front porch, but Alfred joined John under the tree. The family was divided into two armed camps and the hostilities had reached that stage where no quarter could be asked or given.\\n\\nAbout nine o\\u2019clock an automobile came flying down the dusty white road and halted at the gate. A white man slammed the gate and hurried up the walk toward the house, but stopped abruptly before the men beneath the China-berry. It was Mr. Hill, the builder of the new bridge that was to span the river.\\n\\n\\u201cHowdy John, Howdy Alf. I\\u2019m mighty glad I found you. I am in trouble.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell now, Mist\\u2019 Hill,\\u201d answered Alfred slowly but pleasantly. \\u201cWe\\u2019se glad you foun\\u2019 us too. What trouble could you be having now?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s the bridge. The weather bureau says that the rains will be upon me in forty-eight hours. If it catches the bridge as it is now, I\\u2019m afraid all my work of the past five months will be swept away, to say nothing of a quarter of a million dollars\\u2019 worth of labor and material. I\\u2019ve got all my men at work now and I thought to get as many extra hands as I could t0 help out tonight and tomorrow. We can make her weather tight in that time if I can get about twenty more.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ll go, Mister Hill,\\u201d said John with a great deal of energy. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want papa out on that bridge\\u2014too dangerous.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGood for you, John!\\u201d cried the white man. \\u201cNow if I had a few more men of your brawn and brain, I could build an entirely new bridge in forty-eight hours. Come on and jump into the car. I am taking the men on down as I find them.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWait a minute. I must put on my blue jeans. I won\\u2019t be long.\\u201d\\n\\nJohn arose and strode to the house. He knew that his mother and wife had overheard everything, but he paused for a moment to speak to them.\\n\\n\\u201cMamma, I am going to work all night on the bridge.\\u201d\\n\\nThere was no answer. He turned to his wife.\\n\\n\\u201cStella, don\\u2019t be lonesome. I will be home at day-break.\\u201d\\n\\nHis wife was as silent as his mother. John stood for a moment on the steps, then resolutely strode past the women and into the house. A few minutes later he emerged clad in his blue overalls and brogans. This time he said nothing to the silent figures rocking back and forth on the porch. But when he was a few feet from the steps he called back: \\u201cBye, mamma; bye, Stella,\\u201d and hurried on down the walk to where his father sat.\\n\\n\\u201cSo long, papa. I\\u2019ll be home around seven.\\u201d\\n\\nAlfred roused himself and stood. Placing both hands upon his son\\u2019s broad shoulders he said softly: \\u201cBe keerful son, don\\u2019t fall or nothin\\u2019.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI will, papa. Don\\u2019t you get into a quarrel on my account.\\u201d\\n\\nJohn hurried on to the waiting car and was whirled away.\\n\\nAlfred sat for a long time beneath the tree where his son had left him and smoked on. The women soon went indoors. On the night breeze were borne numerous scents: of jasmine, of roses, of damp earth of the river, of the pine forest near by. A solitary whip-poor-will sent forth his plaintive call from the nearby shrubbery. A giant owl roared and boomed from the woodlot. The calf confined in the barn would bleat and be answered by his mother\\u2019s sympathetic \\u201cmoo\\u201d from the pen. Away down in Lake Howell Creek the basso profundo of the alligators boomed and died, boomed and died.\\n\\nAround ten o\\u2019clock the breeze freshened, growing stiffer until midnight when it became a gale. Alfred fastened the doors and bolted the wooden shutters at the windows. The three persons sat about a round deal table in the kitchen upon which stood a bulky kerosene lamp, flickering and sputtering in the wind that came in through the numerous cracks in the walls. The wind rushed down the chimney blowing puffs of ashes about the room. It banged the cooking utensils on the walls. The drinking gourd hanging outside by the door played a weird tattoo, hollow and unearthly, against the thin wooden wall.\\n\\nThe man and the women sat silently. Even if there had been no storm they would not have talked. They could not go to bed because the women were afraid to retire during a storm and the man wished to stay awake and think with his son. Thus they sat: the women hot with resentment toward the man and terrified by the storm; the man hardly mindful of the tempest but eating his heart out in pity for his boy. Time wore heavily on.\\n\\nAnd now a new element of terror was added. A screech-owl alighted on the roof and shivered forth his doleful cry. Possibly he had been blown out of his nest by the wind. Matty started up at the sound but fell back in her chair, pale and trembling: \\u201cMy Gawd!\\u201d she gasped, \\u201cdat\\u2019s a sho\\u2019 sign uh death.\\u201d\\n\\nStella hurriedly thrust her hand into the salt-jar and threw some into the chimney of the lamp. The color of the flame changed from yellow to blue-green but this burning of salt did not have the desired effect\\u2014to drive away the bird from the roof. Matty slipped out of her blue calico wrapper and turned it wrong side out before replacing it. Even Alfred turned one sock.\\n\\n\\u201cAlf,\\u201d said Matty, \\u201cwhat do you reckon\\u2019s gonna happen from this?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow do Ah know, Matty?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh wisht John hadn\\u2019t went away from heah tuh night.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHumh.\\u201d\\n\\nOutside the tempest raged. The palms rattled dryly and the giant pines groaned and sighed in the grip of the wind. Flying leaves and pine-mast filled the air. Now and then a brilliant flash of lightning disclosed a bird being blown here and there with the wind. The prodigious roar of the thunder seemed to rock the earth. Black clouds hung so low that the tops of the pines were among them moving slowly before the wind and made the darkness awful. The screech-owl continued his tremulous cry.\\n\\nAfter three o\\u2019clock the wind ceased and the rain commenced. Huge drops clattered down upon the shingle roof like buckshot and ran from the eaves in torrents. It entered the house through the cracks in the walls and under the doors. It was a deluge in volume and force but subsided before morning.\\n\\nThe sun came up brightly on the havoc of the wind and rain calling forth millions of feathered creatures. The white sand everywhere was full of tiny cups dug out by the force of the falling raindrops. The rims of the little depressions crunched noisily underfoot.\\n\\nAt daybreak Mr. Redding set out for the bridge. He was uneasy. On arriving he found that the river had risen twelve feet during the cloudburst and was still rising. The slow St. John was swollen far beyond its banks and rushing on to sea like a mountain stream, sweeping away houses, great blocks of earth, cattle, trees\\u2014in short anything that came within its grasp. Even the steel framework of the new bridge was gone!\\n\\nThe siren of the fibre factory was tied down for half an hour, announcing the disaster to the country side. When Alfred arrived therefore he found nearly all the men of the district there.\\n\\nThe river, red and swollen, was full of floating debris. Huge trees were swept along as relentlessly as chicken coops and fence rails. Some steel piles were all that was left of the bridge.\\n\\nAlfred went down to a group of men who were fishing members of the ill-fated construction gang out of the water. Many were able to swim ashore unassisted. Wagons backed up and were hurriedly driven away loaded with wet shivering men. Two men had been killed outright, others seriously wounded. Three men had been drowned. At last all had been accounted for except John Redding. His father ran here and there asking for him, or calling him. No one knew where he was. No one remembered seeing him since daybreak.\\n\\nDozens of women had arrived at the scene of the disaster by this time. Matty and Stella, wrapped in woolen shawls, were among them. They rushed to Alfred in alarm and asked where was John.\\n\\n\\u201cAh doan know,\\u201d answered Alfred impatiently, \\u201cthat\\u2019s what Ah\\u2019m trying to fin\\u2019 out now.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDo you reckon he\\u2019s run away?\\u201d asked Stella thoughtlessly.\\n\\nMatty bristled instantly.\\n\\n\\u201cNaw,\\u201d she answered sternly, \\u201che ain\\u2019t no sneak.\\u201d\\n\\nThe father turned to Fred Mimms, one of the survivors and asked him where John was and how had the bridge been destroyed.\\n\\n\\u201cYuh see,\\u201d said Mimms, \\u201cwhen dat turrible win\\u2019 come up we wuz out \\u2019bout de middle of de river. Some of us wuz on de bridge, some on de derrick. De win\\u2019 blowed so hahd we could skeercely stan\\u2019 and Mist\\u2019 Hill tol\\u2019 us tuh set down fuh a spell. He\\u2019s \\u2019fraid some of us mought go overboard. Den all of a sudden de lights went out\\u2014guess de wires wuz blowed down. We wuz all skeered tuh move for slippin\\u2019 overboard. Den dat rain commenced\\u2014an\\u2019 Ah nevah seed such a down-pour since de flood. We set dere and someone begins tuh pray. Lawd how we did pray tuh be spared! Den somebody raised a song an\\u2019 we sung, you hear me, we sung from de bottom of our hearts till daybreak. When the first light come we couldn\\u2019t see nothin\\u2019 but fog everywhere. You couldn\\u2019t tell which wuz water an\\u2019 which wuz lan\\u2019. But when de sun come up de fog begin to liff, an\\u2019 we could see de water. Dat fog wuz so thick an\\u2019 heavy dat it wuz huggin\\u2019 dat river lak a windin\\u2019 sheet. And when it rose we saw dat de river had rose way up durin\\u2019 the rain. My Gawd, Alf! it wuz runnin\\u2019 high\\u2014so high it nearly teched de span of de bridge\\u2014an\\u2019 red as blood! So much clay, you know from lan\\u2019 she done overflowed. Comin\\u2019 down stream, as fas\\u2019 as \\u2019press train wuz three big pine trees. De first one wuzn\\u2019t fohty feet from us and there wasn\\u2019t no chance to do nothin\\u2019 but pray. De fust one struck us and shook de whole works an\\u2019 befo\\u2019 it could stop shakin\\u2019 the other two hit us an\\u2019 down we went. Ah thought Ah\\u2019d never see home again.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut, Mimms, where\\u2019s John?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh ain\\u2019t seen him, Alf, since de logs struck us. Mebbe he\\u2019s swum ashore, mebbe dey picked him up. What\\u2019s dat floatin\\u2019 way out dere in de water?\\u201d\\n\\nAlfred shaded his eyes with his gnarled brown hand and gazed out into the stream. Sure enough there was a man floating on a piece of timber. He lay prone upon his back. His arms were outstretched, and the water washed over his brogans but his feet were lifted out of the water whenever the timber was buoyed up by the stream. His blue overalls were nearly torn from his body. A heavy piece of steel or timber had struck him in falling for his left side was laid open by the thrust. A great jagged hole wherein the double fists of a man might be thrust, could plainly be seen from the shore. The man was John Redding.\\n\\nEveryone seemed to see him at once. Stella fell to the wet earth in a faint. Matty clung to her husband\\u2019s arm, weeping hysterically. Alfred stood very erect with his wife clinging tearfully to him, but he said nothing. A single tear hung on his lashes for a time then trickled slowly down his wrinkled brown cheek.\\n\\n\\u201cAlf! Alf!\\u201d screamed Matty, \\u201cdere\\u2019s our son. Ah knowed when Ah heard dat owl las\\u2019 night. . . .\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh see \\u2019im, Matty,\\u201d returned her husband softly.\\n\\n\\u201cWhy is yuh standin\\u2019 heah? Go git mah boy.\\u201d\\n\\nThe men were manning a boat to rescue the remains of John Redding when Alfred spoke again.\\n\\n\\u201cMah po\\u2019 boy, his dreams never come true.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAlf,\\u201d complained Matty, \\u201cwhy doantcher hurry an\\u2019 git my boy\\u2014doantcher see he\\u2019s floatin\\u2019 on off?\\u201d\\n\\nHer husband paid her no attention but addressed himself to the rescue-party.\\n\\n\\u201cYou all stop! Leave my boy go on. Doan stop \\u2019im. Doan\\u2019 bring \\u2019im back for dat ole tree to grin at. Leave him g\\u2019wan. He wants tuh go. Ah\\u2019m happy \\u2019cause dis mawnin\\u2019 mah boy is goin\\u2019 tuh sea, he\\u2019s goin\\u2019 tuh sea.\\u201d\\n\\nOut on the bosom of the river, bobbing up and down as if waving good bye, piloting his little craft on the shining river road, John Redding floated away toward Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world\\u2014at last.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"John Redding is a young boy who loves daydreaming and imagining going on great adventures.

I was lying bare-chested in bed, rubbing some gunk from the corner of my right eye. It must have collected while I was sleeping, and to just let it stay there seemed inappropriate. Meanwhile, my left eye was idle, so I gave it the job of looking at my pants. I had taken them off the night before, and now I regretted tossing them so casually over the chair, where they lay wrinkled and crumpled beside my jacket. As my left eye inspected them, I began to wonder whether while sleeping I had shed, snakelike, a layer of skin, for that\\u2019s what my jacket and pants looked like. At this point, a drop of sunshine reached my pant leg; the little splotch of leaping light made me think of a golden flea. And so I felt itchy all over and had my idle left hand make itself useful by scratching.\\n\\nSomeone was knocking on the door.\\n\\nBut who could it be? I was the only person with a reason to come here, and I was already here. So I decided to ignore the knocking and continue with my scratching. Now the door was making a colossal noise, as though it were about to cave in. The person outside, I realized, was knocking not with his hand but with his foot, and, before I had time to think of a response, the door fell to the floor with such a crash that it sent shock waves through me.\\n\\nA brawny fellow with whiskers on his face charged over to my bed. \\u201cYour friend\\u2019s dying, and you\\u2019re still not up?\\u201d he yelled.\\n\\nI\\u2019d never seen this man before. \\u201cHave you come to the wrong address?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cNo chance of that,\\u201d he answered.\\n\\nHis blithe self-assurance made me wonder whether I had somehow gone to sleep in the wrong bed. I jumped up and ran out into the corridor to check the number on the door. But, of course, the door was now lying on the floor of my apartment. On it was written \\u201c26 Hongqiao New Village, Apt. 3.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIs this the door you just kicked down?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, it is,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nSo this was my apartment. \\u201cYou have definitely come to the wrong place,\\u201d I told him.\\n\\nNow it was my confident manner that confused him. He stared at me for a moment. \\u201cAre you or are you not Yu Hua?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, I am,\\u201d I said, \\u201cbut I don\\u2019t know you.\\u201d\\n\\nHe gave a roar of rage. \\u201cYour friend\\u2019s dying!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut I don\\u2019t have any friends!\\u201d I was roaring, too.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s nonsense, you little philistine!\\u201d He glared.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m no philistine,\\u201d I said. \\u201cYou can see the proof of that in the books that fill my room. If you\\u2019re trying to offload this guy on me, I absolutely refuse, because I have never had a single friend. However\\u2014\\u201d I softened my tone. \\u201cHowever, feel free to donate him to my neighbor in Apartment 4. He\\u2019s got a lot of pals and I don\\u2019t think he\\u2019ll mind if you toss in another.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou fickle little philistine!\\u201d He stretched out an arm as thick as my shin and tried to pull my hair.\\n\\nI shrank back to the corner of the bed, shouting desperately, \\u201cI\\u2019m not a philistine\\u2014and I\\u2019ve got the books to prove it.\\u201d\\n\\nWith his firm, cold hand, he grabbed my feeble, warm foot. Then he hauled me out of bed and dumped me on the floor. \\u201cHurry up and get dressed,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOtherwise I\\u2019ll drag you all the way there just as you are.\\u201d\\n\\nI knew it was pointless to argue any further with this guy, because he was at least five times as strong as me. \\u201cSeeing as a dying man wants to see me,\\u201d I told him, \\u201cof course I\\u2019m happy to go.\\u201d\\n\\nSo that was how, on this lousy morning, a muscleman kicked down my door and lumbered me with a friend I had no interest in having\\u2014a friend who was about to die, no less. What\\u2019s more, the north wind was howling like a banshee outside. I had no overcoat or scarf, no gloves or hat\\u2014all I was wearing was a thin jacket as I went off to visit this friend I knew absolutely nothing about.\\n\\nOnce we were in the street, the north wind blew me and the big fellow to the friend\\u2019s house just as quickly as it would blow leaves off a tree. The doorway was piled high with wreaths. The big fellow turned to me and said dolefully, \\u201cYour friend is dead.\\u201d\\n\\nBefore I had time to consider whether this was a cause for rejoicing or for grief, I heard a loud chorus of weeping, toward which the big fellow proceeded to push me.\\n\\nA crowd of tearful men and women surrounded me. \\u201cDon\\u2019t take things so hard,\\u201d they told me solicitously.\\n\\nAll I could do was nod and put on a show of being sad, because now there was no point in saying the things I really wanted to say. I gently patted their shoulders, showing my appreciation for their condolences.\\n\\nThen an old lady tottered forward and grabbed my hand as tears poured down her face. \\u201cMy son is dead,\\u201d she sobbed.\\n\\n\\u201cI know,\\u201d I said. \\u201cI am very sad, because it all happened so suddenly.\\u201d\\n\\nMy comment loosened the floodgates still further, and her wails were now so piercing my hair stood on end.\\n\\n\\u201cPlease don\\u2019t take it so hard,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nHer crying seemed to subside a little and she began to dry her tears with my hand. Then she raised her head and said, \\u201cYou need to take it in stride, too.\\u201d\\n\\nI nodded reassuringly. \\u201cOh, I will do that. We must transform grief into strength.\\u201d\\n\\nShe nodded. \\u201cMy son closed his eyes before you could get here. You don\\u2019t blame him, do you?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, I\\u2019d never do that,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nAgain she fell into a fit of sobbing. After a while she recovered enough to say, \\u201cHe was the only son I had, but he\\u2019s dead. You\\u2019re my son now.\\u201d\\n\\nTugging desperately, I was finally able to retrieve my hand, on the pretext that I needed it to wipe away my own tears, though I had none.

Although the man\\u2019s death had delivered me from a friendship I refused to recognize, it had not relieved me of my burden, for his mother had simply taken his place: an old woman I did not know had become my mother. It was only too clear what I had to do next: I\\u2019d have to fork out twenty yuan to buy a big wreath; I\\u2019d have to don sackcloth and guard his coffin; I\\u2019d have to weep and wail and parade through the streets with one arm around the cremation urn and the other propping up his mother.

Chloe is picking her up soon. It\\u2019s darkening outside. There\\u2019s a rumble in the distance. Thunder spoils milk, her Granny would say. Having lived in Canada for half a century, she never forgot German sayings. Nina empties the rest of the milk into a glass and drinks it up.\\n\\nThey\\u2019ve arrived at the Bavarian Forest Restaurant in Kitchener. The pink neon sign, of which only the \\u201cForest\\u201d part remains, buzzes feebly.\\n\\nThis is their fourth gig at the Bavarian Forest as dancers.

Backstage, Chloe and Nina put on their Rio-the-Carnival costumes. Nina puts a tiara on her head. A slight headache has already begun.\\n\\nThe air in the restaurant is stagnant, like that of the Amazon rainforest. Offstage Nina sees Linda humming, pearls of perspiration on her forehead. Nina and Chloe come onstage from either side, eyeing each other with pasted-on smiles. The rhythm doubles. Samba. The scent of Chloe\\u2019s coconut oil lingers in the air, and Nina thinks of her pi\\u00f1a colada at the Copacabana. The red-cheeked old men behind the beer steins catapult their arms into the air, iPhones in their hands.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s okay. People staring at Nina know that she is a dancer.

We\\u2019d been alone in space too long. Back home, we\\u2019d be treated for space sickness and starlust, our brains scanned and studied for signs that our grey matter had deteriorated in the vacuum. We\\u2019d be swaddled in hospitals, kept barefoot and away from the night sky until we stopped dreaming of plumed nebulas and stopped thinking we could hear the music of the spheres in C minor.\\n\\nBut there was no more Earth, and we were lost, limping along to a semi-terraformed planet we were supposed to be studying and would now be colonizing. We\\u2019d taken to talking each other away from the airlock when the stars started looking like houses in the distance and confirming reality as a matter of course. We might all lose our minds, but probably not at the same time.\\n\\n\\u201cDoes this taste like banana?\\u201d Lucinda asked, chewing on a freeze-dried ration. And we\\u2019d all nod.\\n\\n\\u201cI hear someone breathing out there,\\u201d Antin murmured, standing at one of the portholes. And we\\u2019d all say no, it\\u2019s only rock and plasma, come away from there, look at us instead.\\n\\nSo when Carl found the signal and the voice crackled through the speakers, he asked, \\u201cDo you hear a voice?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d said Jane, and Lucinda, and then one by one we all confirmed that we did hear a voice. Muttering, male, half-covered in static. We all bent close to the speakers.\\n\\nThe voice coughed, and paused, and Lucinda covered her mouth.\\n\\nBreath rattled. More words.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s Russian,\\u201d Antin whispered. None of the rest of us spoke it. Hardly anyone in the space programs did anymore. Russia died at the beginning of the slow end. He swayed in time with the enunciation. \\u201cHe says he\\u2019s lost. Over and over. He\\u2019s lost.\\u201d\\n\\nHe grabbed the mic before the rest of us could stop him and broadcast out into the black. \\u201cZdravstvujtye? Zdravstvujtye?\\u201c\\n\\nA pause. We held our breath, our hearts waiting for the next word to start beating again. It had been so long since we\\u2019d savored the sound of a stranger\\u2019s voice.\\n\\nHe began again. The same pattern.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a recording,\\u201d Carl said. He had tears in his eyes. One ended up in his mustache, a shimmer in the energy-efficient lighting.\\n\\nWe let the voice play all night, damn the fuel reserves, damn the razor-thin margins between death and life on a barely-habitable planet.\\n\\nThe next day, we found the ship. Late twentieth century as near as anyone could guess. Our scanners were calibrated for geological identifications only. We didn\\u2019t know what trick of folding space brought it here. The hull was pitted with burn marks and long scratches from debris. It was just big enough for one person who wasn\\u2019t claustrophobic.\\n\\nMatt and Amal volunteered to go aboard. Amal was forty, probably too old to have children when we made landfall. Matt insisted. We could have debated the impact their possible deaths would have on our as-yet-hypothetical colony, but none of the rest of us wanted to stop them. We helped them put on the suits and tethers.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s cold,\\u201d Amal said when she made it aboard. Her chattering teeth made the radio pop. \\u201cThere he is. Look.\\u201d\\n\\nThey had a camera and we tumbled over each other in a mess of arms and legs and sweating palms to get close to the screen. Lucinda and Regan\\u2013who loved each other so secretly that even they didn\\u2019t know it yet\\u2013held onto each other\\u2019s forearms so tight that Lucinda had waning moon scars from Regan\\u2019s nails for the rest of her life. Antin\\u2019s mouth twitched, and we all knew he was aching for the cigarettes he\\u2019d given up to see the stars.\\n\\nAmal held the camera up to where the cosmonaut\\u2019s eyes used to be. He\\u2019d been handsome. He had a vintage face out of the days of Hugo Boss and ships caught in the orbit of a single planet.\\n\\n\\u201cDo you know who he is?\\u201d Carl asked.\\n\\nAntin shook his head. His hands still didn\\u2019t know what to do. \\u201cThere were so many lost in the early days. When my mother was a child, her class listened to the audio of Vladimir Komarov sobbing.\\u201d\\n\\nMatt\\u2019s breath was the rush of the ocean half-remembered. In and out and in and out. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to die up here like that.\\u201d\\n\\nAmal touched the dead man\\u2019s cheek with one gloved finger. With all the air gone, he was a facsimile of human still, even after these hundreds of years. \\u201cHush. We won\\u2019t die. Think of everything that aligned for you to be here, at the right moment and the right velocity, at the same time as he is. We are in the presence of a miracle. Of a universal astronomical improbability. No one is going to die.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t believe in signs,\\u201d Lucinda said from the deck of our ship, with her arms still bleeding in Regan\\u2019s hands. She didn\\u2019t mean it.\\n\\nMatt went to his knees. Amal smoothed her other hand over his helmet and it would have been comforting had they not been separated by six layers of Mylar and mysterious alloys. She kept her other hand on the cosmonaut, and for a moment the dead Earth and the new were separated by only a touch.\\n\\nWe stripped the old ship for precious metals and spare parts, liquefied the body for the carbon. Our fuel reserves rose above the margin of error. We collected the ice crystals from the interior and thrilled at the taste of unfiltered water. It tasted like dust and dirt and everything else we wouldn\\u2019t see again for months.\\n\\nWe kept the recording. Matt played it when we dimmed the lights for nighttime.

Not even old enough to be married, much less\\u2014well, and just the other day she was baptized by the head pastor himself, practically reciting his sermons verbatim, and then all this\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nBill Lewis, who routinely lied about golfing on the weekends: \\u201cPregnant and everything, oh, the poor thing, well, I\\u2019m sure this isn\\u2019t the first young unmarried girl who winds up with a baby and then, you know, winds up dead, as horrible as it sounds, I mean, you know\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nAnd they did know. Everyone knew.\\n\\nIt got so bad, during his sermon, my father threw in a line about faith, and always having it, even when strange things like young girls dying too soon and communion tables breaking clean in half happened. And that was that: my father had spoken. The murmurs stilled almost instantly.\\n\\nFather, gruffly: \\u201cSon, hand me that piece of wood.\\u201d\\n\\nHe was making a new communion table. Corkscrew wood shavings littered the floor\\u2014tiny pieces of holy to be swept up and thrown away. He was building God from scratch\\u2014tiny pieces of conviction and power that would be collected with the care of a creator molding his creation, to be put into the pockets of people\\u2019s minds until they forgot that it was there altogether.\\n\\nFrom outside the church window, you could see the track field. Four boys, lanky and tan, were racing against each other. First one pulled ahead, then another, then another. Girls on the sidelines stood cheering, occasionally ripping up grass and throwing it at each other. Finally, one of the boys\\u2014the one with long hair\\u2014won. He sprawled out on the track, chest heaving. I watched him throw his arms up in the air\\u2014another triumph over the invisible ghosts in our sky.\\n\\nMe, the son: \\u201cYou\\u2019ve heard the rumors, right?\\u201d\\n\\nFather: \\u201cThe Bible wasn\\u2019t written on rumors.\\u201d\\n\\nMe, ignoring Father: \\u201cThey\\u2019re saying that Mary was pregnant when she died.\\u201d\\n\\nFather continued sanding.\\n\\nMe: \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m thinking, well, I\\u2019m thinking about all the times we had her over. Especially when mom was away. I\\u2019m thinking, like, she stayed late a lot, and, you were gone a lot, with her, I\\u2019m guessing, and well, now she\\u2019s dead. And so, I guess\\u2014I guess I\\u2019m thinking, it was you and it was your baby, and well\\u2014well, I\\u2019ve heard the stories, you know, about unmarried girls and their babies and the people with reputations to keep who kill them. So.\\u201d\\n\\nFather had stopped sanding the table. His hands were shaking. Hard. He said nothing.\\n\\nThen, Me, again: \\u201cI went into church yesterday, after they found it, you know, her body? And I think I heard\\u2014I think I heard god. Except, he didn\\u2019t say anything, it just sounded like he was running. Running away. From you\\u2014from us\\u2014from everything.\\u201d\\n\\nThere was a silence. Well, an almost silence. I could hear something like a shower faucet, dripping three\\u2014maybe even six or seven\\u2014rooms away.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In this story, the narrator, the son of the head pastor of a small church, describes the aftermath of an incident where the communion table breaks in half, spilling grape juice and crackers everywhere.

She wanted to visit some of her connections in east Tennessee and she was seizing at every chance to change Bailey's mind. Bailey was the son she lived with, her only boy. He was sitting on the edge of his chair at the table, bent over the orange sports section of the Journal. \\\"Now look here, Bailey,\\\" she said, \\\"see here, read this,\\\" and she stood with one hand on her thin hip and the other rattling the newspaper at his bald head. \\\"Here this fellow that calls himself The Misfit is aloose from the Federal Pen and headed toward Florida and you read here what it says he did to these people. Just you read it. I wouldn't take my children in any direction with a criminal like that aloose in it. I couldn't answer to my conscience if I did.\\\"\\n\\nBailey didn't look up from his reading so she wheeled around then and faced the children's mother, a young woman in slacks, whose face was as broad and innocent as a cabbage and was tied around with a green head-kerchief that had two points on the top like rabbit's ears. She was sitting on the sofa, feeding the baby his apricots out of a jar. \\\"The children have been to Florida before,\\\" the old lady said. \\\"You all ought to take them somewhere else for a change so they would see different parts of the world and be broad. They never have been to east Tennessee.\\\"\\n\\nThe children's mother didn't seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, John Wesley, a stocky child with glasses, said, \\\"If you don't want to go to Florida, why dontcha stay at home?\\\" He and the little girl, June Star, were reading the funny papers on the floor.\\n\\n\\\"She wouldn't stay at home to be queen for a day,\\\" June Star said without raising her yellow head.\\n\\n\\\"Yes and what would you do if this fellow, The Misfit, caught you?\\\" the grandmother asked.\\n\\n\\\"I'd smack his face,\\\" John Wesley said.\\n\\n\\\"She wouldn't stay at home for a million bucks,\\\" June Star said. \\\"Afraid she'd miss something. She has to go everywhere we go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right, Miss,\\\" the grandmother said. \\\"Just remember that the next time you want me to curl your hair.\\\"\\n\\nJune Star said her hair was naturally curly.\\n\\nThe next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. She had her big black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it she was hiding a basket with Pitty Sing, the cat, in it. She didn't intend for the cat to be left alone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he might brush against one of the gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. Her son, Bailey, didn't like to arrive at a motel with a cat.\\n\\nShe sat in the middle of the back seat with John Wesley and June Star on either side of her. Bailey and the children's mother and the baby sat in front and they left Atlanta at eight forty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. The grandmother wrote this down because she thought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. It took them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city.\\n\\nThe old lady settled herself comfortably, removing her white cotton gloves and putting them up with her purse on the shelf in front of the back window. The children's mother still had on slacks and still had her head tied up in a green kerchief, but the grandmother had on a navy blue straw sailor hat with a bunch of white violets on the brim and a navy blue dress with a small white dot in the print. Her collars and cuffs were white organdy trimmed with lace and at her neckline she had pinned a purple spray of cloth violets containing a sachet. In case of an accident, anyone seeing her dead on the highway would know at once that she was a lady.\\n\\nShe said she thought it was going to be a good day for driving, neither too hot nor too cold, and she cautioned Bailey that the speed limit was fifty-five miles an hour and that the patrolmen hid themselves behind billboards and small clumps of trees and sped out after you before you had a chance to slow down. She pointed out interesting details of the scenery: Stone Mountain; the blue granite that in some places came up to both sides of the highway; the brilliant red clay banks slightly streaked with purple; and the various crops\\n\\nthat made rows of green lace-work on the ground. The trees were full of silver-white sunlight and the meanest of them sparkled. The children were reading comic magazines and their mother had gone back to sleep.\\n\\n\\\"Let's go through Georgia fast so we won't have to look at it much,\\\" John Wesley said.\\n\\n\\\"If I were a little boy,\\\" said the grandmother, \\\"I wouldn't talk about my native state that way. Tennessee has the mountains and Georgia has the hills.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tennessee is just a hillbilly dumping ground,\\\" John Wesley said, \\\"and Georgia is a lousy state too.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You said it,\\\" June Star said.\\n\\n\\\"In my time,\\\" said the grandmother, folding her thin veined fingers, \\\"children were more respectful of their native states and their parents and everything else. People did right then. Oh look at the cute little pickaninny!\\\" she said and pointed to a Negro child standing in the door of a shack. \\\"Wouldn't that make a picture, now?\\\" she asked and they all turned and looked at the little Negro out of the back window. He waved.\\n\\n\\\"He didn't have any britches on,\\\" June Star said.\\n\\n\\\"He probably didn't have any,\\\" the grandmother explained. \\\"Little niggers in the country don't have things like we do. If I could paint, I'd paint that picture,\\\" she said.\\n\\nThe children exchanged comic books.\\n\\nThe grandmother offered to hold the baby and the children's mother passed him over the front seat to her. She set him on her knee and bounced him and told him about the things they were passing. She rolled her eyes and screwed up her mouth and stuck her leathery thin face into his smooth bland one. Occasionally he gave her a faraway smile. They passed a large cotton field with five or six graves fenced in the middle of it, like a small island. \\\"Look at the graveyard!\\\" the grandmother said, pointing it out. \\\"That was the old family burying ground. That belonged to the plantation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where's the plantation?\\\" John Wesley asked.\\n\\n\\\"Gone With the Wind,\\\" said the grandmother. \\\"Ha. Ha.\\\"\\n\\nWhen the children finished all the comic books they had brought, they opened the lunch and ate it. The grandmother ate a peanut butter sandwich and an olive and would not let\\n\\nthe children throw the box and the paper napkins out the window. When there was nothing else to do they played a game by choosing a cloud and making the other two guess what shape it suggested. John Wesley took one the shape of a cow and June Star guessed a cow and John Wesley said, no, an automobile, and June Star said he didn't play fair, and they began to slap each other over the grandmother.\\n\\nThe grandmother said she would tell them a story if they would keep quiet. When she told a story, she rolled her eyes and waved her head and was very dramatic. She said once when she was a maiden lady she had been courted by a Mr. Edgar Atkins Teagarden from Jasper, Georgia. She said he was a very good-looking man and a gentleman and that he brought her a watermelon every Saturday afternoon with his initials cut in it, E. A. T. Well, one Saturday, she said, Mr. Teagarden brought the watermelon and there was nobody at home and he left it on the front porch and returned in his buggy to Jasper, but she never got the watermelon, she said, because a nigger boy ate it when he saw the initials, E. A. T.! This story tickled John Wesley's funny bone and he giggled and giggled but June Star didn't think it was any good. She said she wouldn't marry a man that just brought her a watermelon on Saturday. The grandmother said she would have done well to marry Mr. Teagarden because he was a gentleman and had bought Coca-Cola stock when it first came out and that he had died only a few years ago, a very wealthy man.\\n\\nThey stopped at The Tower for barbecued sandwiches. The Tower was a part stucco and part wood filling station and dance hall set in a clearing outside of Timothy. A fat man named Red Sammy Butts ran it and there were signs stuck here and there on the building and for miles up and down the highway saying, TRY RED SAMMY'S FAMOUS BARBECUE. NONE LIKE FAMOUS RED SAMMY'S! RED SAM! THE FAT BOY WITH THE HAPPY LAUGH. A VETERAN! RED SAMMY'S YOUR MAN!\\n\\nRed Sammy was lying on the bare ground outside The Tower with his head under a truck while a gray monkey about a foot high, chained to a small chinaberry tree, chattered nearby. The monkey sprang back into the tree and got on the highest limb as soon as he saw the children jump out of the car and run toward him.\\n\\nInside, The Tower was a long dark room with a counter at one end and tables at the other and dancing space in the middle. They all sat down at a board table next to the nickelodeon and Red Sam's wife, a tall burnt-brown woman with hair and eyes lighter than her skin, came and took their order. The children's mother put a dime in the machine and played \\\"The Tennessee Waltz,\\\" and the grandmother said that tune always made her want to dance. She asked Bailey if he would like to dance but he only glared at her. He didn't have a naturally sunny disposition like she did and trips made him nervous. The grandmother's brown eyes were very bright. She swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her chair. June Star said play something she could tap to so the children's mother put in another dime and played a fast number and June Star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap routine.\\n\\n\\\"Ain't she cute?\\\" Red Sam's wife said, leaning over the counter. \\\"Would you like to come be my little girl?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No I certainly wouldn't,\\\" June Star said. \\\"I wouldn't live in a broken-down place like this for a minion bucks!\\\" and she ran back to the table.\\n\\n\\\"Ain't she cute?\\\" the woman repeated, stretching her mouth politely.\\n\\n\\\"Arn't you ashamed?\\\" hissed the grandmother.\\n\\nRed Sam came in and told his wife to quit lounging on the counter and hurry up with these people's order. His khaki trousers reached just to his hip bones and his stomach hung over them like a sack of meal swaying under his shirt. He came over and sat down at a table nearby and let out a combination sigh and yodel. \\\"You can't win,\\\" he said. \\\"You can't win,\\\" and he wiped his sweating red face off with a gray handkerchief. \\\"These days you don't know who to trust,\\\" he said. \\\"Ain't that the truth?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"People are certainly not nice like they used to be,\\\" said the grandmother.\\n\\n\\\"Two fellers come in here last week,\\\" Red Sammy said, \\\"driving a Chrysler. It was a old beat-up car but it was a good one and these boys looked all right to me. Said they worked\\n\\nat the mill and you know I let them fellers charge the gas they bought? Now why did I do that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because you're a good man!\\\" the grandmother said at once.\\n\\n\\\"Yes'm, I suppose so,\\\" Red Sam said as if he were struck with this answer.\\n\\nHis wife brought the orders, carrying the five plates all at once without a tray, two in each hand and one balanced on her arm. \\\"It isn't a soul in this green world of God's that you can trust,\\\" she said. \\\"And I don't count nobody out of that, not nobody,\\\" she repeated, looking at Red Sammy.\\n\\n\\\"Did you read about that criminal, The Misfit, that's escaped?\\\" asked the grandmother.\\n\\n\\\"I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he didn't attact this place right here,\\\" said the woman. \\\"If he hears about it being here,I wouldn't be none surprised to see him. If he hears it's two cent in the cash register, I wouldn't be a tall surprised if he . . .\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That'll do,\\\" Red Sam said. \\\"Go bring these people their Co'-Colas,\\\" and the woman went off to get the rest of the order.\\n\\n\\\"A good man is hard to find,\\\" Red Sammy said. \\\"Every- thing is getting terrible. I remember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more.\\\"\\n\\nHe and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion Europe was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you would think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was exactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the lacy chinaberry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully between his teeth as if it were a delicacy.\\n\\nThey drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grand- mother took cat naps and woke up every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled an old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady. She said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks leading up to it and two little wooden trellis\\n\\narbors on either side in front where you sat down with your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to it. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the more she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin arbors were still standing. \\\"There was a secret panel in this house,\\\" she said craftily, not telling the truth but wishing that she were, \\\"and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in it when Sherman came through but it was never found . . .\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hey!\\\" John Wesley said. \\\"Let's go see it! We'll find it! We'll poke all the woodwork and find it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can't we turn off there?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We never have seen a house with a secret panel!\\\" June Star shrieked. \\\"Let's go to the house with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can't we go see the house with the secret panel!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's not far from here, I know,\\\" the grandmother said. \\\"It wouldn't take over twenty minutes.\\\"\\n\\nBailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. \\\"No,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret panel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother's shoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their vacation, that they could never do what THEY wanted to do. The baby began to scream and John Wesley kicked the back of the seat so hard that his father could feel the blows in his kidney.\\n\\n\\\"All right!\\\" he shouted and drew the car to a stop at the side of the road. \\\"Will you all shut up? Will you all just shut up for one second? If you don't shut up, we won't go anywhere.\\n\\n\\\"It would be very educational for them,\\\" the grandmother murmured.\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" Bailey said, \\\"but get this: this is the only time we're going to stop for anything like this. This is the one and only time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The dirt road that you have to turn down is about a mile back,\\\" the grandmother directed. \\\"I marked it when we passed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A dirt road,\\\" Bailey groaned.\\n\\nAfter they had turned around and were headed toward the dirt road, the grandmother recalled other points about the house, the beautiful glass over the front doorway and the candle-lamp in the hall. John Wesley said that the secret panel was probably in the fireplace.\\n\\n\\\"You can't go inside this house,\\\" Bailey said. \\\"You don't know who lives there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"While you all talk to the people in front, I'll run around behind and get in a window,\\\" John Wesley suggested.\\n\\n\\\"We'll all stay in the car,\\\" his mother said. They turned onto the dirt road and the car raced roughly along in a swirl of pink dust. The grandmother recalled the times when there were no paved roads and thirty miles was a day's journey. The dirt road was hilly and there were sudden washes in it and sharp curves on dangerous embankments. All at once they would be on a hill, looking down over the blue tops of trees for miles around, then the next minute, they would be in a red depression with the dust-coated trees looking down on them.\\n\\n\\\"This place had better turn up in a minute,\\\" Bailey said, \\\"or I'm going to turn around.\\\"\\n\\nThe road looked as if no one had traveled on it in months.\\n\\n\\\"It's not much farther,\\\" the grandmother said and just as she said it, a horrible thought came to her. The thought was so embarrassing that she turned red in the face and her eyes dilated and her feet jumped up, upsetting her valise in the corner. The instant the valise moved, the newspaper top she had over the basket under it rose with a snarl and Pitty Sing,the cat, sprang onto Bailey's shoulder.\\n\\nThe children were thrown to the floor and their mother, clutching the baby, was thrown out the door onto the ground; the old lady was thrown into the front seat. The car turned over once and landed right-side-up in a gulch off the side of the road. Bailey remained in the driver's seat with the cat-gray-striped with a broad white face and an orange nose-clinging to his neck like a caterpillar.\\n\\nAs soon as the children saw they could move their arms and legs, they scrambled out of the car, shouting, \\\"We've had an ACCIDENT!\\\" The grandmother was curled up under the\\n\\ndashboard, hoping she was injured so that Bailey's wrath would not come down on her all at once. The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had remembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee.\\n\\nBailey removed the cat from his neck with both hands and flung it out the window against the side of a pine tree. Then he got out of the car and started looking for the children's mother. She was sitting against the side of the red gutted ditch, holding the screaming baby, but she only had a cut down her face and a broken shoulder. \\\"We've had an ACCIDENT!\\\" the children screamed in a frenzy of delight.\\n\\n\\\"But nobody's killed,\\\" June Star said with disappointment as the grandmother limped out of the car, her hat still pinned to her head but the broken front brim standing up at a jaunty angle and the violet spray hanging off the side. They all sat down in the ditch, except the children, to recover from the shock. They were all shaking.\\n\\n\\\"Maybe a car will come along,\\\" said the children's mother hoarsely.\\n\\n\\\"I believe I have injured an organ,\\\" said the grandmother, pressing her side, but no one answered her. Bailey's teeth were clattering. He had on a yellow sport shirt with bright blue parrots designed in it and his face was as yellow as the l shirt. The grandmother decided that she would not mention that the house was in Tennessee.\\n\\nThe road was about ten feet above and they could see only the tops of the trees on the other side of it. Behind the ditch they were sitting in there were more woods, tall and dark and deep. In a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as if the occupants were watching them. The grandmother stood up and waved both arms dramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared around a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over. It was a big black battered hearse-like automobile. There were three men in it.\\n\\nIt came to a stop just over them and for some minutes, the driver looked down with a steady expressionless gaze to where they were sitting, and didn't speak. Then he turned his\\n\\nhead and muttered something to the other two and they got out. One was a fat boy in black trousers and a red sweat shirt with a silver stallion embossed on the front of it. He moved around on the right side of them and stood staring, his mouth partly open in a kind of loose grin. The other had on khaki pants and a blue striped coat and a gray hat pulled down very low, hiding most of his face. He came around slowly on the left side. Neither spoke.\\n\\nThe driver got out of the car and stood by the side of it, looking down at them. He was an older man than the other two. His hair was just beginning to gray and he wore silver- rimmed spectacles that gave him a scholarly look. He had a long creased face and didn't have on any shirt or undershirt. He had on blue jeans that were too tight for him and was holding a black hat and a gun. The two boys also had guns.\\n\\n\\\"We've had an ACCIDENT!\\\" the children screamed.\\n\\nThe grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she knew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known him au her life but she could not recall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment, placing his feet carefully so that he wouldn't slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks, and his ankles were red and thin. \\\"Good afternoon,\\\" he said. \\\"I see you all had you a little spill.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We turned over twice!\\\" said the grandmother.\\n\\n\\\"Once\\\",\\\" he corrected. \\\"We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram,\\\" he said quietly to the boy with the gray hat.\\n\\n\\\"What you got that gun for?\\\" John Wesley asked. \\\"Whatcha gonna do with that gun?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lady,\\\" the man said to the children's mother, \\\"would you mind calling them children to sit down by you? Children make me nervous. I want all you all to sit down right together there where you're at.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What are you telling US what to do for?\\\" June Star asked.\\n\\nBehind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. \\\"Come here,\\\" said their mother.\\n\\n\\\"Look here now,\\\" Bailey began suddenly, \\\"we're in a predicament! We're in . . .\\\"\\n\\nThe grandmother shrieked. She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. \\\"You're The Misfit!\\\" she said. \\\"I recognized you at once!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes'm,\\\" the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be known, \\\"but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn't of reckernized me.\\\"\\n\\nBailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the children. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened.\\n\\n\\\"Lady,\\\" he said, \\\"don't you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don't mean. I don't reckon he meant to talk to you thataway.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You wouldn't shoot a lady, would you?\\\" the grandmother said and removed a clean handkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.\\n\\nThe Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then covered it up again. \\\"I would hate to have to,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Listen,\\\" the grandmother almost screamed, \\\"I know you're a good man. You don't look a bit like you have com- mon blood. I know you must come from nice people!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes mam,\\\" he said, \\\"finest people in the world.\\\" When he smiled he showed a row of strong white teeth. \\\"God never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy's heart was pure gold,\\\" he said. The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was standing with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. \\\"Watch them children, Bobby Lee,\\\" he said. \\\"You know they make me nervous.\\\" He looked at the six of them huddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn't think of anything to say. \\\"Ain't a cloud in the sky,\\\" he remarked, looking up at it. \\\"Don't see no sun but don't see no cloud neither.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, it's a beautiful day,\\\" said the grandmother. \\\"Listen,\\\" she said, \\\"you shouldn't call yourself The Misfit because I know you're a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hush!\\\" Bailey yelled. \\\"Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!\\\" He was squatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn't move.\\n\\n\\\"I prechate that, lady,\\\" The Misfit said and drew a little circle in the ground with the butt of his gun.\\n\\n\\\"It'll take a half a hour to fix this here car,\\\" Hiram called, looking over the raised hood of it.\\n\\n\\\"Well, first you and Bobby Lee get him and that little boy to step over yonder with you,\\\" The Misfit said, pointing to Bailey and John Wesley. \\\"The boys want to ast you some- thing,\\\" he said to Bailey. \\\"Would you mind stepping back in them woods there with them?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Listen,\\\" Bailey began, \\\"we're in a terrible predicament! Nobody realizes what this is,\\\" and his voice cracked. His eyes were as blue and intense as the parrots in his shirt and he remained perfectly still.\\n\\nThe grandmother reached up to adjust her hat brim as if she were going to the woods with him but it came off in her hand. She stood staring at it and after a second she let it fall on the ground. Hiram pulled Bailey up by the arm as if he were assisting an old man. John Wesley caught hold of his father's hand and Bobby Lee followed. They went off toward the woods and just as they reached the dark edge, Bailey turned and supporting himself against a gray naked pine trunk, he shouted, \\\"I'll be back in a minute, Mamma, wait on me!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come back this instant!\\\" his mother shrilled but they all disappeared into the woods.\\n\\n\\\"Bailey Boy!\\\" the grandmother called in a tragic voice but she found she was looking at The Misfit squatting on the ground in front of her. \\\"I just know you're a good man,\\\" she said desperately. \\\"You're not a bit common!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nome, I ain't a good man,\\\" The Misfit said after a second as if he had considered her statement carefully, \\\"but I ain't the worst in the world neither. My daddy said I was a different breed of dog from my brothers and sisters. 'You know,' Daddy said, 'it's some that can live their whole life out without asking about it and it's others has to know why it is, and this boy is one of the latters. He's going to be into every- thing!'\\\" He put on his black hat and looked up suddenly and then away deep into the woods as if he were embarrassed again. \\\"I'm sorry I don't have on a shirt before you ladies,\\\" he said, hunching his shoulders slightly. \\\"We buried our clothes that we had on when we escaped and we're just\\n\\nmaking do until we can get better. We borrowed these from some folks we met,\\\" he explained.\\n\\n\\\"That's perfectly all right,\\\" the grandmother said. \\\"Maybe Bailey has an extra shirt in his suitcase.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll look and see terrectly,\\\" The Misfit said.\\n\\n\\\"Where are they taking him?\\\" the children's mother screamed.\\n\\n\\\"Daddy was a card himself,\\\" The Misfit said. \\\"You couldn't put anything over on him. He never got in trouble with the Authorities though. Just had the knack of handling them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You could be honest too if you'd only try,\\\" said the grandmother. \\\"Think how wonderful it would be to settle down and live a comfortable life and not have to think about some- body chasing you all the time.\\\"\\n\\nThe Misfit kept scratching in the ground with the butt of his gun as if he were thinking about it. \\\"Yes'm, somebody is always after you,\\\" he murmured.\\n\\nThe grandmother noticed how thin his shoulder blades were just behind-his hat because she was standing up looking down on him. \\\"Do you ever pray?\\\" she asked.\\n\\nHe shook his head. All she saw was the black hat wiggle between his shoulder blades. \\\"Nome,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThere was a pistol shot from the woods, followed closely by another. Then silence. The old lady's head jerked around. She could hear the wind move through the tree tops like a long satisfied insuck of breath. \\\"Bailey Boy!\\\" she called.\\n\\n\\\"I was a gospel singer for a while,\\\" The Misfit said. \\\"I been most everything. Been in the arm service, both land and sea, at home and abroad, been twict married, been an undertaker, been with the railroads, plowed Mother Earth, been in a tornado, seen a man burnt alive oncet,\\\" and he looked up at the children's mother and the little girl who were sitting close together, their faces white and their eyes glassy; \\\"I even seen a woman flogged,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Pray, pray,\\\" the grandmother began, \\\"pray, pray . . .\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I never was a bad boy that I remember of,\\\" The Misfit said in an almost dreamy voice, \\\"but somewheres along the line I done something wrong and got sent to the penitentiary. I was buried alive,\\\" and he looked up and held her attention to him by a steady stare.\\n\\n\\\"That's when you should have started to pray,\\\" she said \\\"What did you do to get sent to the penitentiary that first time?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Turn to the right, it was a wall,\\\" The Misfit said, looking up again at the cloudless sky. \\\"Turn to the left, it was a wall. Look up it was a ceiling, look down it was a floor. I forget what I done, lady. I set there and set there, trying to remember what it was I done and I ain't recalled it to this day. Oncet in a while, I would think it was coming to me, but it never come.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maybe they put you in by mistake,\\\" the old lady said vaguely.\\n\\n\\\"Nome,\\\" he said. \\\"It wasn't no mistake. They had the papers on me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You must have stolen something,\\\" she said.\\n\\nThe Misfit sneered slightly. \\\"Nobody had nothing I wanted,\\\" he said. \\\"It was a head-doctor at the penitentiary said what I had done was kill my daddy but I known that for a lie. My daddy died in nineteen ought nineteen of the epidemic flu and I never had a thing to do with it. He was buried in the Mount Hopewell Baptist churchyard and you can go there and see for yourself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you would pray,\\\" the old lady said, \\\"Jesus would help you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's right,\\\" The Misfit said.\\n\\n\\\"Well then, why don't you pray?\\\" she asked trembling with delight suddenly.\\n\\n\\\"I don't want no hep,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm doing all right by myself.\\\"\\n\\nBobby Lee and Hiram came ambling back from the woods. Bobby Lee was dragging a yellow shirt with bright blue parrots in it.\\n\\n\\\"Thow me that shirt, Bobby Lee,\\\" The Misfit said. The shirt came flying at him and landed on his shoulder and he put it on. The grandmother couldn't name what the shirt reminded her of. \\\"No, lady,\\\" The Misfit said while he was buttoning it up, \\\"I found out the crime don't matter. You can do one thing or you can do another, kill a man or take a tire off his car, because sooner or later you're going to forget what it was you done and just be punished for it.\\\"\\n\\nThe children's mother had begun to make heaving noises as if she couldn't get her breath. \\\"Lady,\\\" he asked, \\\"would you and that little girl like to step off yonder with Bobby Lee and Hiram and join your husband?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, thank you,\\\" the mother said faintly. Her left arm dangled helplessly and she was holding the baby, who had gone to sleep, in the other. \\\"Hep that lady up, Hiram,\\\" The Misfit said as she struggled to climb out of the ditch, \\\"and Bobby Lee, you hold onto that little girl's hand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't want to hold hands with him,\\\" June Star said. \\\"He reminds me of a pig.\\\"\\n\\nThe fat boy blushed and laughed and caught her by the arm and pulled her off into the woods after Hiram and her mother.\\n\\nAlone with The Misfit, the grandmother found that she had lost her voice. There was not a cloud in the sky nor any sun. There was nothing around her but woods. She wanted to tell him that he must pray. She opened and closed her mouth several times before anything came out. Finally she found herself saying, \\\"Jesus. Jesus,\\\" meaning, Jesus will help you, but the way she was saying it, it sounded as if she might be cursing.\\n\\n\\\"Yes'm,\\\" The Misfit said as if he agreed. \\\"Jesus shown everything off balance. It was the same case with Him as with me except He hadn't committed any crime and they could prove I had committed one because they had the papers on me. Of course,\\\" he said, \\\"they never shown me my papers. That's why I sign myself now. I said long ago, you get you a signature and sign everything you do and keep a copy of it. Then you'll know what you done and you can hold up the crime to the punishment and see do they match and in the end you'll have something to prove you ain't been treated right. I call myself The Misfit,\\\" he said, \\\"because I can't make what all I done wrong fit what all I gone through in punishment.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a piercing scream from the woods, followed closely by a pistol report. \\\"Does it seem right to you, lady, that one is punished a heap and another ain't punished at all?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Jesus!\\\" the old lady cried. \\\"You've got good blood! I know you wouldn't shoot a lady! I know you come from nice people! Pray! Jesus, you ought not to shoot a lady. I'll give you all the money I've got!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lady,\\\" The Misfit said, looking beyond her far into the woods, \\\"there never was a body that give the undertaker a tip.\\\"\\n\\nThere were two more pistol reports and the grandmother raised her head like a parched old turkey hen crying for water and called, \\\"Bailey Boy, Bailey Boy!\\\" as if her heart would break.\\n\\n\\\"Jesus was the only One that ever raised the dead,\\\" The Misfit continued, \\\"and He shouldn't have done it. He shown everything off balance. If He did what He said, then it's nothing for you to do but thow away everything and follow Him, and if He didn't, then it's nothing for you to do but enjoy the few minutes you got left the best way you can-by killing somebody or burning down his house or doing some other meanness to him. No pleasure but meanness,\\\" he said and his voice had become almost a snarl.\\n\\n\\\"Maybe He didn't raise the dead,\\\" the old lady mumbled, not knowing what she was saying and feeling so dizzy that she sank down in the ditch with her legs twisted under her.\\n\\n\\\"I wasn't there so I can't say He didn't,\\\" The Misfit said. \\\"I wisht I had of been there,\\\" he said, hitting the ground with his fist. \\\"It ain't right I wasn't there because if I had of been there I would of known. Listen lady,\\\" he said in a high voice, \\\"if I had of been there I would of known and I wouldn't be like I am now.\\\" His voice seemed about to crack and the grandmother's head cleared for an instant. She saw the man's face twisted close to her own as if he were going to cry and she murmured, \\\"Why you're one of my babies. You're one of my own children!\\\" She reached out and touched him on the shoulder. The Misfit sprang back as if a snake had bitten him and shot her three times through the chest. Then he put his gun down on the ground and took off his glasses and began to clean them.\\n\\nHiram and Bobby Lee returned from the woods and stood over the ditch, looking down at the grandmother who half sat and half lay in a puddle of blood with her legs crossed under her like a child's and her face smiling up at the cloudless sky.\\n\\nWithout his glasses, The Misfit's eyes were red-rimmed and pale and defenseless-looking. \\\"Take her off and thow her where you shown the others,\\\" he said, picking up the cat that was rubbing itself against his leg.\\n\\n\\\"She was a talker, wasn't she?\\\" Bobby Lee said, sliding down the ditch with a yodel.\\n\\n\\\"She would of been a good woman,\\\" The Misfit said, \\\"if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Some fun!\\\" Bobby Lee said.\\n\\n\\\"Shut up, Bobby Lee\\\" The Misfit said. \\\"It's no real pleasure in life.\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"\\\"The Grandmother\\\" is a short story by Flannery O'Connor that revolves around a family road trip that takes a dark turn. The story begins with the grandmother trying to convince her son, Bailey, to change their vacation plans to Florida and go to Tennessee instead, due to her fear of a criminal called The Misfit who has escaped from prison and is heading towards Florida. Despite her efforts, the family continues their journey towards Florida.\\n\\nDuring the car ride, the grandmother engages in a conversation with her grandchildren, John Wesley and June Star, about the criminal, and they express their lack of concern. They mock their grandmother's worry and imply that she wouldn't stay at home even if The Misfit were to catch her. As they continue driving, the grandmother tells stories and tries to engage the family, all while worrying about the escaped criminal.\\n\\nEventually, the family stops at a restaurant called The Tower, where they have a tense encounter with Red Sammy Butts, the owner, who laments about the lack of trustworthiness in people. The grandmother mentions the criminal, and Red Sammy becomes concerned about their safety. They leave the restaurant and continue their journey.\\n\\nWhile on the road, the grandmother suddenly recalls a house in Tennessee that she wants to visit. She convinces Bailey to take a detour and visit the house, but along the way, she realizes that the house is actually in Tennessee, not Georgia. Distressed, she keeps this information to herself.\\n\\nAs they drive on a remote dirt road, the grandmother becomes increasingly anxious about the destination, and Bailey, frustrated with her, loses control of the car and it overturns in a ditch. Moments later, a car approaches them, and three men, including The Misfit, get out. The grandmother recognizes The Misfit and panics, trying to reason with him and impress upon him that he is a good man with good blood. The Misfit and his accomplices take Bailey and his son, John Wesley, into the woods, leaving the grandmother alone with The Misfit. She continues to plead for her life, even referring to The Misfit as one of her own children.\\n\\nThe Misfit becomes agitated and shoots the grandmother three times. He then orders his accomplices to take the grandmother's body to where they had taken Bailey and John Wesley. The story concludes with The Misfit reflecting on the grandmother's talkative nature and her fascination with him before leaving the scene.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"In the short story \\\"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\\\" by Flannery O'Connor, the Grandmother insists on taking a trip to east Tennessee instead of going to Florida with her son Bailey and his family. She argues with Bailey over a newspaper article that mentions an escaped criminal called The Misfit heading towards Florida. The Grandmother fears that he might harm her family, but Bailey dismisses her concerns.\\n\\nThey set off on the car trip, and along the way, the Grandmother reminisces about her past and continuously tries to convince Bailey to take the detour to see an old plantation house. The children, John Wesley and June Star, are disinterested and ask her why she doesn't just stay home if she doesn't want to go to Florida.\\n\\nThe family stops at a roadside diner called The Tower, and they encounter a man named Red Sammy Butts. Red Sammy complains about how the world has gotten worse with dishonest people and reflects on a recent incident where two strangers tricked him into giving them money for gas. The Grandmother tells Red Sammy about an escaped criminal on the loose, but he dismisses her warnings.\\n\\nBack on the road, the Grandmother unknowingly causes an accident by startling the family cat, Pitty Sing, who leaps onto Bailey's shoulder, distracting him. The car overturns, and they are stranded in the middle of nowhere.\\n\\nAs they wait for someone to help, a car with three men arrives. The leader is The Misfit, the escaped criminal the Grandmother had warned them about. The family is led into the woods with him, leaving Bailey and his son unarmed. The Grandmother tries to initiate a conversation about religion and goodness with The Misfit while subtly trying to convince him not to harm her family. Meanwhile, the other two men, Bobby Lee and Hiram, take Bailey and the young boy into the woods separately.\\n\\nUltimately, The Misfit ends up shooting the entire family, starting with the Grandmother. The story ends with The Misfit reflecting on his actions and the difficult questions about goodness, faith, and humanity that his encounter with the family raises.\\n\\nThroughout the story, O'Connor explores themes of violence, manipulation, and redemption as she delves into the complex motivations of her characters. The Grandmother, in her self-absorption and insistence on doing as she pleases, ends up inadvertently leading her family into the hands of dangerous individuals. Conversely, The Misfit is portrayed as a complex character, capable of glimpses of self-awareness and grappling with questions of morality.

An uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces.\\nThe former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back drawing-room. Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all the rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers. Among these I found a few paper-covered books, the pages of which were curled and damp: The Abbot, by Walter Scott, The Devout Communicant, and The Memoirs of Vidocq. I liked the last best because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house contained a central apple-tree and a few straggling bushes, under one of which I found the late tenant's rusty bicycle-pump. He had been a very charitable priest; in his will he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of his house to his sister.\\nWhen the short days of winter came, dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinners. When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the silent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses, where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness. When we returned to the street, light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner, we hid in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan's sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea, we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan's steps resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her before he obeyed, and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body, and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side.\\nEvery morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood.\\nHer image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance. On Saturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I had to go to carry some of the parcels. We walked through the flaring streets, jostled by drunken men and bargaining women, amid the curses of labourers, the shrill litanies of shop-boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs' cheeks, the nasal chanting of street-singers, who sang a come-all-you about O'Donovan Rossa, or a ballad about the troubles in our native land. These noises converged in a single sensation of life for me: I imagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes. Her name sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and praises which I myself did not understand. My eyes were often full of tears I could not tell why and at times a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out into my bosom. I thought little of the future. I did not know whether I would ever speak to her or not or, if I spoke to her, how I could tell her of my confused adoration. But my body was like a harp and her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the wires.\\nOne evening I went into the back drawing-room in which the priest had died. It was a dark rainy evening and there was no sound in the house. Through one of the broken panes I heard the rain impinge upon the earth, the fine incessant needles of water playing in the sodden beds. Some distant lamp or lighted window gleamed below me. I was thankful that I could see so little. All my senses seemed to desire to veil themselves and, feeling that I was about to slip from them, I pressed the palms of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: 'O love! O love!' many times.\\nAt last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me was I going to Araby. I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It would be a splendid bazaar; she said she would love to go.\\n'And why can't you?' I asked.\\nWhile she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist. She could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week in her convent. Her brother and two other boys were fighting for their caps, and I was alone at the railings. She held one of the spikes, bowing her head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one side of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible as she stood at ease.\\n'It's well for you,' she said.\\n'If I go,' I said, 'I will bring you something.'\\nWhat innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts after that evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening days. I chafed against the work of school. At night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came between me and the page I strove to read. The syllables of the word Araby were called to me through the silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment over me. I asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night. My aunt was surprised, and hoped it was not some Freemason affair. I answered few questions in class. I watched my master's face pass from amiability to sternness; he hoped I was not beginning to idle. I could not call my wandering thoughts together. I had hardly any patience with the serious work of life which, now that it stood between me and my desire, seemed to me child's play, ugly monotonous child's play.\\nOn Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to the bazaar in the evening. He was fussing at the hallstand, looking for the hat-brush, and answered me curtly:\\n'Yes, boy, I know.'\\nAs he was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour and lie at the window. I felt the house in bad humour and walked slowly towards the school. The air was pitilessly raw and already my heart misgave me.\\nWhen I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home. Still it was early. I sat staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking began to irritate me, I left the room. I mounted the staircase and gained the upper part of the house. The high, cold, empty, gloomy rooms liberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front window I saw my companions playing below in the street. Their cries reached me weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the cool glass, I looked over at the dark house where she lived. I may have stood there for an hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress.\\nWhen I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at the fire. She was an old, garrulous woman, a pawnbroker's widow, who collected used stamps for some pious purpose. I had to endure the gossip of the tea-table. The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come. Mrs Mercer stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn't wait any longer, but it was after eight o'clock and she did not like to be out late, as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone I began to walk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said:\\n'I'm afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord.'\\nAt nine o'clock I heard my uncle's latchkey in the hall door. I heard him talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had received the weight of his overcoat. I could interpret these signs. When he was midway through his dinner I asked him to give me the money to go to the bazaar. He had forgotten.\\n'The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,' he said.\\nI did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically:\\n'Can't you give him the money and let him go? You've kept him late enough as it is.'\\nMy uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he believed in the old saying: 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.' He asked me where I was going and, when I told him a second time, he asked me did I know The Arab's Farewell to his Steed. When I left the kitchen he was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt.\\nI held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street towards the station. The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled to me the purpose of my journey. I took my seat in a third-class carriage of a deserted train. After an intolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly. It crept onward among ruinous houses and over the twinkling river. At Westland Row Station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors; but the porters moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the bazaar. I remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the train drew up beside an improvised wooden platform. I passed out on to the road and saw by the lighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me was a large building which displayed the magical name.\\nI could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the bazaar would be closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile, handing a shilling to a weary-looking man. I found myself in a big hall girded at half its height by a gallery. Nearly all the stalls were closed and the greater part of the hall was in darkness. I recognized a silence like that which pervades a church after a service. I walked into the centre of the bazaar timidly. A few people were gathered about the stalls which were still open. Before a curtain, over which the words Caf\\u00e9 Chantant were written in coloured lamps, two men were counting money on a salver. I listened to the fall of the coins.\\nRemembering with difficulty why I had come, I went over to one of the stalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered tea-sets. At the door of the stall a young lady was talking and laughing with two young gentlemen. I remarked their English accents and listened vaguely to their conversation.\\n'O, I never said such a thing!'\\n'O, but you did!'\\n'O, but I didn't!'\\n'Didn't she say that?'\\n'Yes. I heard her.'\\n'O, there's a. . . fib!'\\nObserving me, the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy anything. The tone of her voice was not encouraging; she seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense of duty. I looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern guards at either side of the dark entrance to the stall and murmured:\\n'No, thank you.'\\nThe young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to the two young men. They began to talk of the same subject. Once or twice the young lady glanced at me over her shoulder.\\nI lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make my interest in her wares seem the more real. Then I turned away slowly and walked down the middle of the bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to fall against the sixpence in my pocket. I heard a voice call from one end of the gallery that the light was out. The upper part of the hall was now completely dark.\\nGazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story is set in North Richmond Street, a quiet street where the Christian Brothers' School releases the boys at the end of the day.

This one is so very old that I cannot understand how it has clung so vividly and tenaciously to my memory. Since then I have seen so many sinister things, either affecting or terrible, that I am astonished at not being able to pass a single day without the face of Mother Bellflower recurring to my mind's eye, just as I knew her formerly long, long ago, when I was ten or twelve years old.\\nShe was an old seamstress who came to my parents' house once a week, every Thursday, to mend the linen. My parents lived in one of those country houses called chateaux, which are merely old houses with pointed roofs, to which are attached three or four adjacent farms.\\nThe village, a large village, almost a small market town, was a few hundred yards off and nestled round the church, a red brick church, which had become black with age.\\nWell, every Thursday Mother Bellflower came between half-past six and seven in the morning and went immediately into the linen room and began to work. She was a tall, thin, bearded or rather hairy woman, for she had a beard all over her face, a surprising, an unexpected beard, growing in improbable tufts, in curly bunches which looked as if they had been sown by a madman over that great face, the face of a gendarme in petticoats. She had them on her nose, under her nose, round her nose, on her chin, on her cheeks, and her eyebrows, which were extraordinarily thick and long and quite gray, bushy and bristling, looked exactly like a pair of mustaches stuck on there by mistake.\\nShe limped, not like lame people generally do, but like a ship pitching. When she planted her great bony, vibrant body on her sound leg, she seemed to be preparing to mount some enormous wave, and then suddenly she dipped as if to disappear in an abyss and buried herself in the ground. Her walk reminded one of a ship in a storm, and her head, which was always covered with an enormous white cap, whose ribbons fluttered down her back, seemed to traverse the horizon from north to south and from south to north at each limp.\\nI adored Mother Bellflower. As soon as I was up I used to go into the linen room, where I found her installed at work with a foot warmer under her feet. As soon as I arrived she made me take the foot warmer and sit upon it, so that I might not catch cold in that large chilly room under the roof.\\n\\\"That draws the blood from your head,\\\" she would say to me.\\nShe told me stories while mending the linen with her long, crooked, nimble fingers; behind her magnifying spectacles, for age had impaired her sight, her eyes appeared enormous to me, strangely profound, double.\\nAs far as I can remember from the things which she told me and by which my childish heart was moved, she had the large heart of a poor woman. She told me what had happened in the village, how a cow had escaped from the cow house and had been found the next morning in front of Prosper Malet's mill looking at the sails turning, or about a hen's egg which had been found in the church belfry without anyone being able to understand what creature had been there to lay it, or the queer story of Jean Pila's dog who had gone ten leagues to bring back his master's breeches which a tramp had stolen while they were hanging up to dry out of doors after he had been caught in the rain. She told me these simple adventures in such a manner that in my mind they assumed the proportions of never-to-be-forgotten dramas, of grand and mysterious poems; and the ingenious stories invented by the poets, which my mother told me in the evening, had none of the flavor, none of the fullness or of the vigor of the peasant woman's narratives.\\nWell, one Thursday when I had spent all the morning in listening to Mother Clochette, I wanted to go upstairs to her again during the day after picking hazelnuts with the manservant in the wood behind the farm. I remember it all as clearly as what happened only yesterday.\\nOn opening the door of the linen room I saw the old seamstress lying on the floor by the side of her chair, her face turned down and her arms stretched out, but still holding her needle in one hand and one of my shirts in the other. One of her legs in a blue stocking, the longer one no doubt, was extended under her chair, and her spectacles glistened by the wall, where they had rolled away from her.\\nI ran away uttering shrill cries. They all came running, and in a few minutes I was told that Mother Clochette was dead.\\nI cannot describe the profound, poignant, terrible emotion which stirred my childish heart. I went slowly down into the drawing room and hid myself in a dark corner in the depths of a great old armchair, where I knelt and wept. I remained there for a long time, no doubt, for night came on. Suddenly someone came in with a lamp--without seeing me, however--and heard my father and mother talking with the medical man, whose voice recognized.\\nHe had been sent for immediately, and he was explaining the cause of the accident, of which I understood nothing, however. Then he sat down and had a glass of liqueur and a biscuit.\\nHe went on talking, and what he then said will remain engraved on my mind until I die. I think that I can give the exact words which he used.\\n\\\"Ah!\\\" he said. \\\"The poor woman! she broke her leg the day of my arrival here. I had not even had time to wash my hands after getting off the diligence before I was sent for in all haste, for it was a bad case, very bad.\\n\\\"She was seventeen and a pretty girl, very pretty! Would anyone believe it? I have never told her story before; in fact, no one but myself and one other person, who is no longer living in this part of the country, ever knew it. Now that she is dead I may be less discreet.\\n\\\"A young assistant teacher had just come to live in the village; he was good looking and had the bearing of a soldier. All the girls ran after him, but he was disdainful. Besides that, he was very much afraid of his superior, the schoolmaster, old Grabu, who occasionally got out of bed the wrong foot first.\\n\\\"Old Grabu already employed pretty Hortense, who has just died here and who was afterward nicknamed Clochette. The assistant master singled out the pretty young girl who was no doubt flattered at being chosen by this disdainful conqueror; at any rate, she fell in love with him, and he succeeded in persuading her to give him a first meeting in the hayloft behind the school at night after she had done her day's sewing.\\n\\\"She pretended to go home, but instead of going downstairs when she left the Grabus', she went upstairs and hid among the hay to wait for her lover. He soon joined her, and he was beginning to say pretty things to her, when the door of the hayloft opened and the schoolmaster appeared and asked: 'What are you doing up there, Sigisbert?' Feeling sure that he would be caught, the young schoolmaster lost his presence of mind and replied stupidly: 'I came up here to rest a little among the bundles of hay, Monsieur Grabu.'\\n\\\"The loft was very large and absolutely dark. Sigisbert pushed the frightened girl to the farther end and said: 'Go, there and hide yourself. I shall lose my situation, so get away and hide yourself.'\\n\\\"When the schoolmaster heard the whispering he continued: 'Why, you are not by yourself.'\\n\\\"'Yes, I am, Monsieur Grabu!'\\n\\\"'But you are not, for you are talking.'\\n\\\"'I swear I am, Monsieur Grabu.'\\n\\\"'I will soon find out,' the old man replied and, double-locking the door, he went down to get a light.\\n\\\"Then the young man, who was a coward such as one sometimes meets, lost his head, and he repeated, having grown furious all of a sudden: 'Hide yourself, so that he may not find you. You will deprive me of my bread for my whole life; you will ruin my whole career! Do hide yourself!'\\n\\\"They could hear the key turning in the lock again, and Hortense ran to the window which looked out onto the street, opened it quickly and then in a low and determined voice said: 'You will come and pick me up when he is gone,' and she jumped out.\\n\\\"Old Grabu found nobody and went down again in great surprise! A quarter of an hour later Monsieur Sigisbert came to me and related his adventure. The girl had remained at the foot of the wall, unable to get up, as she had fallen from the second story, and I went with him to fetch her. It was raining in torrents, and I brought the unfortunate girl home with me, for the right leg was broken in three places, and the bones had come out through the flesh. She did not complain and merely said with admirable resignation: 'I am punished, well punished!'\\n\\\"I sent for assistance and for the workgirl's friends and told them a made-up story of a runaway carriage which had knocked her down and lamed her outside my door. They believed me, and the gendarmes for a whole month tried in vain to find the author of this accident.\\n\\\"That is all! Now I say that this woman was a heroine and had the fiber of those who accomplish the grandest deeds in history.\\n\\\"That was her only love affair, and she died a virgin. She was a martyr, a noble soul, a sublimely devoted woman! And if I did not absolutely admire her I should not have told you this story, which I would never tell anyone during her life; you understand why.\\\"\\nThe doctor ceased; Mamma cried, and Papa said some words which I did not catch; then they left the room, and I remained on my knees in the armchair and sobbed, while I heard a strange noise of heavy footsteps and something knocking against the side of the staircase.\\nThey were carrying away Clochette's body.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The narrator recalls his memories of an old seamstress named Mother Bellflower who used to come to his parents' house once a week to mend the linen.

The old banker was walking up and down his study and remembering how, fifteen years before, he had given a party one autumn evening. There had been many clever men there, and there had been interesting conversations. Among other things they had talked of capital punishment. The majority of the guests, among whom were many journalists and intellectual men, disapproved of the death penalty. They considered that form of punishment out of date, immoral, and unsuitable for Christian States. In the opinion of some of them the death penalty ought to be replaced everywhere by imprisonment for life.\\n\\\"I don't agree with you,\\\" said their host the banker. \\\"I have not tried either the death penalty or imprisonment for life, but if one may judge _a priori_, the death penalty is more moral and more humane than imprisonment for life. Capital punishment kills a man at once, but lifelong imprisonment kills him slowly. Which executioner is the more humane, he who kills you in a few minutes or he who drags the life out of you in the course of many years?\\\"\\n\\\"Both are equally immoral,\\\" observed one of the guests, \\\"for they both have the same object -- to take away life. The State is not God. It has not the right to take away what it cannot restore when it wants to.\\\"\\nAmong the guests was a young lawyer, a young man of five-and-twenty. When he was asked his opinion, he said:\\n\\\"The death sentence and the life sentence are equally immoral, but if I had to choose between the death penalty and imprisonment for life, I would certainly choose the second. To live anyhow is better than not at all.\\\"\\nA lively discussion arose. The banker, who was younger and more nervous in those days, was suddenly carried away by excitement; he struck the table with his fist and shouted at the young man:\\n\\\"It's not true! I'll bet you two millions you wouldn't stay in solitary confinement for five years.\\\"\\n\\\"If you mean that in earnest,\\\" said the young man, \\\"I'll take the bet, but I would stay not five but fifteen years.\\\"\\n\\\"Fifteen? Done!\\\" cried the banker. \\\"Gentlemen, I stake two millions!\\\"\\n\\\"Agreed! You stake your millions and I stake my freedom!\\\" said the young man.\\nAnd this wild, senseless bet was carried out! The banker, spoilt and frivolous, with millions beyond his reckoning, was delighted at the bet. At supper he made fun of the young man, and said:\\n\\\"Think better of it, young man, while there is still time. To me two millions are a trifle, but you are losing three or four of the best years of your life. I say three or four, because you won't stay longer. Don't forget either, you unhappy man, that voluntary confinement is a great deal harder to bear than compulsory. The thought that you have the right to step out in liberty at any moment will poison your whole existence in prison. I am sorry for you.\\\"\\nAnd now the banker, walking to and fro, remembered all this, and asked himself: \\\"What was the object of that bet? What is the good of that man's losing fifteen years of his life and my throwing away two millions? Can it prove that the death penalty is better or worse than imprisonment for life? No, no. It was all nonsensical and meaningless. On my part it was the caprice of a pampered man, and on his part simple greed for money. . . .\\\"\\nThen he remembered what followed that evening. It was decided that the young man should spend the years of his captivity under the strictest supervision in one of the lodges in the banker's garden. It was agreed that for fifteen years he should not be free to cross the threshold of the lodge, to see human beings, to hear the human voice, or to receive letters and newspapers. He was allowed to have a musical instrument and books, and was allowed to write letters, to drink wine, and to smoke. By the terms of the agreement, the only relations he could have with the outer world were by a little window made purposely for that object. He might have anything he wanted -- books, music, wine, and so on -- in any quantity he desired by writing an order, but could only receive them through the window. The agreement provided for every detail and every trifle that would make his imprisonment strictly solitary, and bound the young man to stay there _exactly_ fifteen years, beginning from twelve o'clock of November 14, 1870, and ending at twelve o'clock of November 14, 1885. The slightest attempt on his part to break the conditions, if only two minutes before the end, released the banker from the obligation to pay him two millions.\\nFor the first year of his confinement, as far as one could judge from his brief notes, the prisoner suffered severely from loneliness and depression. The sounds of the piano could be heard continually day and night from his lodge. He refused wine and tobacco. Wine, he wrote, excites the desires, and desires are the worst foes of the prisoner; and besides, nothing could be more dreary than drinking good wine and seeing no one. And tobacco spoilt the air of his room. In the first year the books he sent for were principally of a light character; novels with a complicated love plot, sensational and fantastic stories, and so on.\\nIn the second year the piano was silent in the lodge, and the prisoner asked only for the classics. In the fifth year music was audible again, and the prisoner asked for wine. Those who watched him through the window said that all that year he spent doing nothing but eating and drinking and lying on his bed, frequently yawning and angrily talking to himself. He did not read books. Sometimes at night he would sit down to write; he would spend hours writing, and in the morning tear up all that he had written. More than once he could be heard crying.\\nIn the second half of the sixth year the prisoner began zealously studying languages, philosophy, and history. He threw himself eagerly into these studies -- so much so that the banker had enough to do to get him the books he ordered. In the course of four years some six hundred volumes were procured at his request. It was during this period that the banker received the following letter from his prisoner:\\n\\\"My dear Jailer, I write you these lines in six languages. Show them to people who know the languages. Let them read them. If they find not one mistake I implore you to fire a shot in the garden. That shot will show me that my efforts have not been thrown away. The geniuses of all ages and of all lands speak different languages, but the same flame burns in them all. Oh, if you only knew what unearthly happiness my soul feels now from being able to understand them!\\\" The prisoner's desire was fulfilled. The banker ordered two shots to be fired in the garden.\\nThen after the tenth year, the prisoner sat immovably at the table and read nothing but the Gospel. It seemed strange to the banker that a man who in four years had mastered six hundred learned volumes should waste nearly a year over one thin book easy of comprehension. Theology and histories of religion followed the Gospels.\\nIn the last two years of his confinement the prisoner read an immense quantity of books quite indiscriminately. At one time he was busy with the natural sciences, then he would ask for Byron or Shakespeare. There were notes in which he demanded at the same time books on chemistry, and a manual of medicine, and a novel, and some treatise on philosophy or theology. His reading suggested a man swimming in the sea among the wreckage of his ship, and trying to save his life by greedily clutching first at one spar and then at another.\\nII\\nThe old banker remembered all this, and thought:\\n\\\"To-morrow at twelve o'clock he will regain his freedom. By our agreement I ought to pay him two millions. If I do pay him, it is all over with me: I shall be utterly ruined.\\\"\\nFifteen years before, his millions had been beyond his reckoning; now he was afraid to ask himself which were greater, his debts or his assets. Desperate gambling on the Stock Exchange, wild speculation and the excitability which he could not get over even in advancing years, had by degrees led to the decline of his fortune and the proud, fearless, self-confident millionaire had become a banker of middling rank, trembling at every rise and fall in his investments. \\\"Cursed bet!\\\" muttered the old man, clutching his head in despair \\\"Why didn't the man die? He is only forty now. He will take my last penny from me, he will marry, will enjoy life, will gamble on the Exchange; while I shall look at him with envy like a beggar, and hear from him every day the same sentence: 'I am indebted to you for the happiness of my life, let me help you!' No, it is too much! The one means of being saved from bankruptcy and disgrace is the death of that man!\\\"\\nIt struck three o'clock, the banker listened; everyone was asleep in the house and nothing could be heard outside but the rustling of the chilled trees. Trying to make no noise, he took from a fireproof safe the key of the door which had not been opened for fifteen years, put on his overcoat, and went out of the house.\\nIt was dark and cold in the garden. Rain was falling. A damp cutting wind was racing about the garden, howling and giving the trees no rest. The banker strained his eyes, but could see neither the earth nor the white statues, nor the lodge, nor the trees. Going to the spot where the lodge stood, he twice called the watchman. No answer followed. Evidently the watchman had sought shelter from the weather, and was now asleep somewhere either in the kitchen or in the greenhouse.\\n\\\"If I had the pluck to carry out my intention,\\\" thought the old man, \\\"Suspicion would fall first upon the watchman.\\\"\\nHe felt in the darkness for the steps and the door, and went into the entry of the lodge. Then he groped his way into a little passage and lighted a match. There was not a soul there. There was a bedstead with no bedding on it, and in the corner there was a dark cast-iron stove. The seals on the door leading to the prisoner's rooms were intact.\\nWhen the match went out the old man, trembling with emotion, peeped through the little window. A candle was burning dimly in the prisoner's room. He was sitting at the table. Nothing could be seen but his back, the hair on his head, and his hands. Open books were lying on the table, on the two easy-chairs, and on the carpet near the table.\\nFive minutes passed and the prisoner did not once stir. Fifteen years' imprisonment had taught him to sit still. The banker tapped at the window with his finger, and the prisoner made no movement whatever in response. Then the banker cautiously broke the seals off the door and put the key in the keyhole. The rusty lock gave a grating sound and the door creaked. The banker expected to hear at once footsteps and a cry of astonishment, but three minutes passed and it was as quiet as ever in the room. He made up his mind to go in.\\nAt the table a man unlike ordinary people was sitting motionless. He was a skeleton with the skin drawn tight over his bones, with long curls like a woman's and a shaggy beard. His face was yellow with an earthy tint in it, his cheeks were hollow, his back long and narrow, and the hand on which his shaggy head was propped was so thin and delicate that it was dreadful to look at it. His hair was already streaked with silver, and seeing his emaciated, aged-looking face, no one would have believed that he was only forty. He was asleep. . . . In front of his bowed head there lay on the table a sheet of paper on which there was something written in fine handwriting.\\n\\\"Poor creature!\\\" thought the banker, \\\"he is asleep and most likely dreaming of the millions. And I have only to take this half-dead man, throw him on the bed, stifle him a little with the pillow, and the most conscientious expert would find no sign of a violent death. But let us first read what he has written here. . . .\\\"\\nThe banker took the page from the table and read as follows:\\n\\\"To-morrow at twelve o'clock I regain my freedom and the right to associate with other men, but before I leave this room and see the sunshine, I think it necessary to say a few words to you. With a clear conscience I tell you, as before God, who beholds me, that I despise freedom and life and health, and all that in your books is called the good things of the world.\\n\\\"For fifteen years I have been intently studying earthly life. It is true I have not seen the earth nor men, but in your books I have drunk fragrant wine, I have sung songs, I have hunted stags and wild boars in the forests, have loved women. . . . Beauties as ethereal as clouds, created by the magic of your poets and geniuses, have visited me at night, and have whispered in my ears wonderful tales that have set my brain in a whirl. In your books I have climbed to the peaks of Elburz and Mont Blanc, and from there I have seen the sun rise and have watched it at evening flood the sky, the ocean, and the mountain-tops with gold and crimson. I have watched from there the lightning flashing over my head and cleaving the storm-clouds. I have seen green forests, fields, rivers, lakes, towns. I have heard the singing of the sirens, and the strains of the shepherds' pipes; I have touched the wings of comely devils who flew down to converse with me of God. . . . In your books I have flung myself into the bottomless pit, performed miracles, slain, burned towns, preached new religions, conquered whole kingdoms. . . .\\n\\\"Your books have given me wisdom. All that the unresting thought of man has created in the ages is compressed into a small compass in my brain. I know that I am wiser than all of you.\\n\\\"And I despise your books, I despise wisdom and the blessings of this world. It is all worthless, fleeting, illusory, and deceptive, like a mirage. You may be proud, wise, and fine, but death will wipe you off the face of the earth as though you were no more than mice burrowing under the floor, and your posterity, your history, your immortal geniuses will burn or freeze together with the earthly globe.\\n\\\"You have lost your reason and taken the wrong path. You have taken lies for truth, and hideousness for beauty. You would marvel if, owing to strange events of some sorts, frogs and lizards suddenly grew on apple and orange trees instead of fruit, or if roses began to smell like a sweating horse; so I marvel at you who exchange heaven for earth. I don't want to understand you.\\n\\\"To prove to you in action how I despise all that you live by, I renounce the two millions of which I once dreamed as of paradise and which now I despise. To deprive myself of the right to the money I shall go out from here five hours before the time fixed, and so break the compact. . . .\\\"\\nWhen the banker had read this he laid the page on the table, kissed the strange man on the head, and went out of the lodge, weeping. At no other time, even when he had lost heavily on the Stock Exchange, had he felt so great a contempt for himself. When he got home he lay on his bed, but his tears and emotion kept him for hours from sleeping.\\nNext morning the watchmen ran in with pale faces, and told him they had seen the man who lived in the lodge climb out of the window into the garden, go to the gate, and disappear. The banker went at once with the servants to the lodge and made sure of the flight of his prisoner. To avoid arousing unnecessary talk, he took from the table the writing in which the millions were renounced, and when he got home locked it up in the fireproof safe.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story begins with a discussion between a group of individuals regarding the death penalty and life imprisonment.

The whole region was sparsely settled by people of the frontier--restless souls who no sooner had hewn fairly habitable homes out of the wilderness and attained to that degree of prosperity which today we should call indigence, than, impelled by some mysterious impulse of their nature, they abandoned all and pushed farther westward, to encounter new perils and privations in the effort to regain the meager comforts which they had voluntarily renounced. Many of them had already forsaken that region for the remoter settlements, but among those remaining was one who had been of those first arriving. He lived alone in a house of logs surrounded on all sides by the great forest, of whose gloom and silence he seemed a part, for no one had ever known him to smile nor speak a needless word. His simple wants were supplied by the sale or barter of skins of wild animals in the river town, for not a thing did he grow upon the land which, if needful, he might have claimed by right of undisturbed possession. There were evidences of \\\"improvement\\\"--a few acres of ground immediately about the house had once been cleared of its trees, the decayed stumps of which were half concealed by the new growth that had been suffered to repair the ravage wrought by the ax. Apparently the man's zeal for agriculture had burned with a failing flame, expiring in penitential ashes.\\nThe little log house, with its chimney of sticks, its roof of warping clapboards weighted with traversing poles and its \\\"chinking\\\" of clay, had a single door and, directly opposite, a window. The latter, however, was boarded up--nobody could remember a time when it was not. And none knew why it was so closed; certainly not because of the occupant's dislike of light and air, for on those rare occasions when a hunter had passed that lonely spot the recluse had commonly been seen sunning himself on his doorstep if heaven had provided sunshine for his need. I fancy there are few persons living today who ever knew the secret of that window, but I am one, as you shall see.\\nThe man's name was said to be Murlock. He was apparently seventy years old, actually about fifty. Something besides years had had a hand in his aging. His hair and long, full beard were white, his gray, lusterless eyes sunken, his face singularly seamed with wrinkles which appeared to belong to two intersecting systems. In figure he was tall and spare, with a stoop of the shoulders--a burden bearer. I never saw him; these particulars I learned from my grandfather, from whom also I got the man's story when I was a lad. He had known him when living near by in that early day.\\nOne day Murlock was found in his cabin, dead. It was not a time and place for coroners and newspapers, and I suppose it was agreed that he had died from natural causes or I should have been told, and should remember. I know only that with what was probably a sense of the fitness of things the body was buried near the cabin, alongside the grave of his wife, who had preceded him by so many years that local tradition had retained hardly a hint of her existence. That closes the final chapter of this true story--excepting, indeed, the circumstance that many years afterward, in company with an equally intrepid spirit, I penetrated to the place and ventured near enough to the ruined cabin to throw a stone against it, and ran away to avoid the ghost which every well-informed boy thereabout knew haunted the spot. But there is an earlier chapter--that supplied by my grandfather.\\nWhen Murlock built his cabin and began laying sturdily about with his ax to hew out a farm--the rifle, meanwhile, his means of support--he was young, strong and full of hope. In that eastern country whence he came he had married, as was the fashion, a young woman in all ways worthy of his honest devotion, who shared the dangers and privations of his lot with a willing spirit and light heart. There is no known record of her name; of her charms of mind and person tradition is silent and the doubter is at liberty to entertain his doubt; but God forbid that I should share it! Of their affection and happiness there is abundant assurance in every added day of the man's widowed life; for what but the magnetism of a blessed memory could have chained that venturesome spirit to a lot like that?\\nOne day Murlock returned from gunning in a distant part of the forest to find his wife prostrate with fever, and delirious. There was no physician within miles, no neighbor; nor was she in a condition to be left, to summon help. So he set about the task of nursing her back to health, but at the end of the third day she fell into unconsciousness and so passed away, apparently, with never a gleam of returning reason.\\nFrom what we know of a nature like his we may venture to sketch in some of the details of the outline picture drawn by my grandfather. When convinced that she was dead, Murlock had sense enough to remember that the dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty he blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others which he did correctly were done over and over. His occasional failures to accomplish some simple and ordinary act filled him with astonishment, like that of a drunken man who wonders at the suspension of familiar natural laws. He was surprised, too, that he did not weep--surprised and a little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead. \\\"Tomorrow,\\\" he said aloud, \\\"I shall have to make the coffin and dig the grave; and then I shall miss her, when she is no longer in sight; but now--she is dead, of course, but it is all right--it must be all right, somehow. Things cannot be so bad as they seem.\\\"\\nHe stood over the body in the fading light, adjusting the hair and putting the finishing touches to the simple toilet, doing all mechanically, with soulless care. And still through his consciousness ran an undersense of conviction that all was right--that he should have her again as before, and everything explained. He had had no experience in grief; his capacity had not been enlarged by use. His heart could not contain it all, nor his imagination rightly conceive it. He did not know he was so hard struck; that knowledge would come later, and never go. Grief is an artist of powers as various as the instruments upon which he plays his dirges for the dead, evoking from some the sharpest, shrillest notes, from others the low, grave chords that throb recurrent like the slow beating of a distant drum. Some natures it startles; some it stupefies. To one it comes like the stroke of an arrow, stinging all the sensibilities to a keener life; to another as the blow of a bludgeon, which in crushing benumbs. We may conceive Murlock to have been that way affected, for and here we are upon surer ground than that of conjecture no sooner had he finished his pious work than, sinking into a chair by the side of the table upon which the body lay, and noting how white the profile showed in the deepening gloom, he laid his arms upon the table's edge, and dropped his face into them, tearless yet and unutterably weary. At that moment came in through the open window a long, wailing sound like the cry of a lost child in the far deeps of the darkening woods! But the man did not move. Again, and nearer than before, sounded that unearthly cry upon his failing sense. Perhaps it was a wild beast; perhaps it was a dream. For Murlock was asleep.\\nSome hours later, as it afterward appeared, this unfaithful watcher awoke and lifting his head from his arms intently listened--he knew not why. There in the black darkness by the side of the dead, recalling all without a shock, he strained his eyes to see--he knew not what. His senses were all alert, his breath was suspended, his blood had stilled its tides as if to assist the silence. Who--what had waked him, and where was it?\\nSuddenly the table shook beneath his arms, and at the same moment he heard, or fancied that he heard, a light, soft step--another--sounds as of bare feet upon the floor!\\nHe was terrified beyond the power to cry out or move. Perforce he waited--waited there in the darkness through seeming centuries of such dread as one may know, yet live to tell. He tried vainly to speak the dead woman's name, vainly to stretch forth his hand across the table to learn if she were there. His throat was powerless, his arms and hands were like lead. Then occurred something most frightful. Some heavy body seemed hurled against the table with an impetus that pushed it against his breast so sharply as nearly to overthrow him, and at the same instant he heard and felt the fall of something upon the floor with so violent a thump that the whole house was shaken by the impact. A scuffling ensued, and a confusion of sounds impossible to describe. Murlock had risen to his feet. Fear had by excess forfeited control of his faculties. He flung his hands upon the table. Nothing was there!\\nThere is a point at which terror may turn to madness; and madness incites to action. With no definite intent, from no motive but the wayward impulse of a madman, Murlock sprang to the wall, with a little groping seized his loaded rifle, and without aim discharged it. By the flash which lit up the room with a vivid illumination, he saw an enormous panther dragging the dead woman toward the window, its teeth fixed in her throat! Then there were darkness blacker than before, and silence; and when he returned to consciousness the sun was high and the wood vocal with songs of birds.\\nThe body lay near the window, where the beast had left it when frightened away by the flash and report of the rifle. The clothing was deranged, the long hair in disorder, the limbs lay anyhow. From the throat, dreadfully lacerated, had issued a pool of blood not yet entirely coagulated. The ribbon with which he had bound the wrists was broken; the hands were tightly clenched. Between the teeth was a fragment of the animal's ear.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In 1830, in a remote forest near Cincinnati, lived a reclusive man named Murlock.

In his younger days, he had married a woman who shared his hardships and brought him happiness. However, she fell ill with a fever and eventually passed away, leaving Murlock devastated. He nursed her in her final days but felt a sense of detachment and denial about her death. He buried her near their cabin and continued to live alone.\\n\\nOne day, Murlock was found dead in his cabin.

Murlock, inexperienced in grief, struggled to comprehend the severity of his loss. He mechanically prepared her body for burial and felt a sense that everything would be alright. He didn't cry, but he knew that he would miss her when she was no longer there.\\n\\nAs Murlock sat in the dim light, he heard a wailing sound coming from the woods. It frightened him, but he couldn't move. Suddenly, he felt the table shake and heard soft footsteps. He was paralyzed with fear and couldn't see or speak. Something heavy hit the table and then the floor, causing a commotion. Murlock couldn't explain what was happening or who or what was causing it.\\n\\nIn a moment of madness, Murlock grabbed his rifle and fired it without aiming. The flash illuminated the room, revealing a large panther dragging his wife's lifeless body towards the window. The panther was scared off by the gunshot, and Murlock was left in darkness and silence. When he regained consciousness, it was morning, and the body was still near the window, with signs of the panther's attack.\\n\\nThe story ends with Murlock's grandson recounting the events that had been passed down by his grandfather. The mystery of the boarded-up window and the haunting of Murlock's cabin continued to unsettle the locals.

The earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of was a friend of the family by the name of Higgins. This was in the eleventh century, when our people were living in Aberdeen, county of Cork, England. Why it is that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name except when one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert foolishness, instead of Higgins, is a mystery which none of us has ever felt much desire to stir. It is a kind of vague, pretty romance, and we leave it alone. All the old families do that way.\\nArthour Twain was a man of considerable note--a solicitor on the highway in William Rufus's time. At about the age of thirty he went to one of those fine old English places of resort called Newgate, to see about something, and never returned again. While there he died suddenly.\\nAugustus Twain seems to have made something of a stir about the year 1160. He was as full of fun as he could be, and used to take his old saber and sharpen it up, and get in a convenient place on a dark night, and stick it through people as they went by, to see them jump. He was a born humorist. But he got to going too far with it; and the first time he was found stripping one of these parties, the authorities removed one end of him, and put it up on a nice high place on Temple Bar, where it could contemplate the people and have a good time. He never liked any situation so much or stuck to it so long.\\nThen for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a succession of soldiers--noble, high-spirited fellows, who always went into battle singing, right behind the army, and always went out a-whooping, right ahead of it.\\nThis is a scathing rebuke to old dead Froissart's poor witticism that our family tree never had but one limb to it, and that that one stuck out at right angles, and bore fruit winter and summer.\\nEarly in the fifteenth century we have Beau Twain, called \\\"the Scholar.\\\" He wrote a beautiful, beautiful hand. And he could imitate anybody's hand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off to see it. He had infinite sport with his talent. But by and by he took a contract to break stone for a road, and the roughness of the work spoiled his hand. Still, he enjoyed life all the time he was in the stone business, which, with inconsiderable intervals, was some forty-two years. In fact, he died in harness. During all those long years he gave such satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week till the government gave him another. He was a perfect pet. And he was always a favorite with his fellow-artists, and was a conspicuous member of their benevolent secret society, called the Chain Gang. He always wore his hair short, had a preference for striped clothes, and died lamented by the government. He was a sore loss to his country. For he was so regular.\\nSome years later we have the illustrious John Morgan Twain. He came over to this country with Columbus in 1492 as a passenger. He appears to have been of a crusty, uncomfortable disposition. He complained of the food all the way over, and was always threatening to go ashore unless there was a change. He wanted fresh shad. Hardly a day passed over his head that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air, sneering about the commander, and saying he did not believe Columbus knew where he was going to or had ever been there before. The memorable cry of \\\"Land ho!\\\" thrilled every heart in the ship but his. He gazed awhile through a piece of smoked glass at the penciled line lying on the distant water, and then said: \\\"Land be hanged--it's a raft!\\\"\\nWhen this questionable passenger came on board the ship, be brought nothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked \\\"B. G.,\\\" one cotton sock marked \\\"L. W. C.,\\\" one woolen one marked \\\"D. F.,\\\" and a night-shirt marked \\\"O. M. R.\\\" And yet during the voyage he worried more about his \\\"trunk,\\\" and gave himself more airs about it, than all the rest of the passengers put together. If the ship was \\\"down by the head,\\\" and would not steer, he would go and move his \\\"trunk\\\" further aft, and then watch the effect. If the ship was \\\"by the stern,\\\" he would suggest to Columbus to detail some men to \\\"shift that baggage.\\\" In storms he had to be gagged, because his wailings about his \\\"trunk\\\" made it impossible for the men to hear the orders. The man does not appear to have been openly charged with any gravely unbecoming thing, but it is noted in the ship's log as a \\\"curious circumstance\\\" that albeit he brought his baggage on board the ship in a newspaper, he took it ashore in four trunks, a queensware crate, and a couple of champagne baskets. But when he came back insinuating, in an insolent, swaggering way, that some of this things were missing, and was going to search the other passengers' baggage, it was too much, and they threw him overboard. They watched long and wonderingly for him to come up, but not even a bubble rose on the quietly ebbing tide. But while every one was most absorbed in gazing over the side, and the interest was momentarily increasing, it was observed with consternation that the vessel was adrift and the anchor-cable hanging limp from the bow. Then in the ship's dimmed and ancient log we find this quaint note:\\n\\\"In time it was discouvered yt ye troblesome passenger hadde gone downe and got ye anchor, and toke ye same and solde it to ye dam sauvages from ye interior, saying yt he hadde founde it, ye sonne of a ghun!\\\"\\nYet this ancestor had good and noble instincts, and it is with pride that we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who ever interested himself in the work of elevating and civilizing our Indians. He built a commodious jail and put up a gallows, and to his dying day he claimed with satisfaction that he had had a more restraining and elevating influence on the Indians than any other reformer that ever labored among them. At this point the chronicle becomes less frank and chatty, and closes abruptly by saying that the old voyager went to see his gallows perform on the first white man ever hanged in America, and while there received injuries which terminated in his death.\\nThe great-grandson of the \\\"Reformer\\\" flourished in sixteen hundred and something, and was known in our annals as \\\"the old Admiral,\\\" though in history he had other titles. He was long in command of fleets of swift vessels, well armed and manned, and did great service in hurrying up merchantmen. Vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on, always made good fair time across the ocean. But if a ship still loitered in spite of all he could do, his indignation would grow till he could contain himself no longer-- and then he would take that ship home where he lived and keep it there carefully, expecting the owners to come for it, but they never did. And he would try to get the idleness and sloth out of the sailors of that ship by compelling them to take invigorating exercise and a bath. He called it \\\"walking a plank.\\\" All the pupils liked it. At any rate, they never found any fault with it after trying it. When the owners were late coming for their ships, the Admiral always burned them, so that the insurance money should not be lost. At last this fine old tar was cut down in the fullness of his years and honors. And to her dying day, his poor heart-broken widow believed that if he had been cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been resuscitated.\\nCharles Henry Twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenth century, and was a zealous and distinguished missionary. He converted sixteen thousand South Sea islanders, and taught them that a dog-tooth necklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come to divine service in. His poor flock loved him very, very dearly; and when his funeral was over, they got up in a body and came out of the restaurant with tears in their eyes, and saying, one to another, that he was a good tender missionary, and they wished they had some more of him.\\nPah-go-to-wah-wah-pukketekeewis Mighty-Hunter-with-a-Hog-Eye-Twain adorned the middle of the eighteenth century, and aided General Braddock with all his heart to resist the oppressor Washington. It was this ancestor who fired seventeen times at our Washington from behind a tree. So far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral story-books is correct; but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenth round the awe-stricken savage said solemnly that that man was being reserved by the Great Spirit for some mighty mission, and he dared not lift his sacrilegious rifle against him again, the narrative seriously impairs the integrity of history. What he did say was:\\n\\\"It ain't no hic no use. 'At man's so drunk he can't stan' still long enough for a man to hit him. I hic I can't 'ford to fool away any more am'nition on him.\\\"\\nThat was why he stopped at the seventeenth round, and it was a good, plain, matter-of-fact reason, too, and one that easily commends itself to us by the eloquent, persuasive flavor of probability there is about it.\\nI also enjoyed the story-book narrative, but I felt a marring misgiving that every Indian at Braddock's Defeat who fired at a soldier a couple of times two easily grows to seventeen in a century, and missed him, jumped to the conclusion that the Great Spirit was reserving that soldier for some grand mission; and so I somehow feared that the only reason why Washington's case is remembered and the others forgotten is, that in his the prophecy came true, and in that of the others it didn't. There are not books enough on earth to contain the record of the prophecies Indians and other unauthorized parties have made; but one may carry in his overcoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have been fulfilled.\\nI will remark here, in passing, that certain ancestors of mine are so thoroughly well-known in history by their aliases, that I have not felt it to be worth while to dwell upon them, or even mention them in the order of their birth. Among these may be mentioned Richard Brinsley Twain, alias Guy Fawkes; John Wentworth Twain, alias Sixteen-String Jack; William Hogarth Twain, alias Jack Sheppard; Ananias Twain, alias Baron Munchausen; John George Twain, alias Captain Kydd; and then there are George Francis Twain, Tom Pepper, Nebuchadnezzar, and Baalam's Ass--they all belong to our family, but to a branch of it somewhat distinctly removed from the honorable direct line--in fact, a collateral branch, whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that, in order to acquire the notoriety we have always yearned and hungered for, they have got into a low way of going to jail instead of getting hanged.\\nIt is not well, when writing an autobiography, to follow your ancestry down too close to your own time--it is safest to speak only vaguely of your great-grandfather, and then skip from there to yourself, which I now do.\\nI was born without teeth--and there Richard III. had the advantage of me; but I was born without a humpback, likewise, and there I had the advantage of him. My parents were neither very poor nor conspicuously honest.\\nBut now a thought occurs to me. My own history would really seem so tame contrasted with that of my ancestors, that it is simply wisdom to leave it unwritten until I am hanged. If some other biographies I have read had stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred, it would have been a felicitous thing for the reading public.

The narrator explains that the Twains have mostly used their maternal name throughout history, with a few exceptions when some family members used aliases. The reason for this tradition is unclear, but the family finds it to be a romantic mystery and does not question it.\\n\\nThe narrator then recounts the stories of various ancestors. Arthour Twain, a man who lived in William Rufus's time, was a solicitor on the highway. However, he disappeared when he went to Newgate, a place of resort, and was found dead there. Augustus Twain, who lived around 1160, was known for his sense of humor. He would play pranks on people by sticking his saber through them in the dark to scare them. However, he took his pranks too far and was eventually caught and punished by having one of his limbs put on display.\\n\\nThe next two hundred years of the family's history were filled with soldiers who were brave and high-spirited.

He was well-liked and respected by his fellow-workers and was a prominent member of their secret society called the Chain Gang.\\n\\nThe narrator then mentions another relative, John Morgan Twain, who traveled to America with Columbus in 1492. He was a difficult passenger, constantly complaining about the food and doubting Columbus' abilities. When they reached land, he dismissed it as a raft. He brought only a few items on board the ship, but when they arrived ashore, he claimed that some of his belongings were missing and insisted on searching the other passengers' baggage. The irritated passengers threw him overboard, and as they looked for him to resurface, they noticed that the ship was adrift because he had taken the anchor and sold it to Native Americans.\\n\\nDespite his skills as a troublemaker, the narrator points out that this particular ancestor had good intentions and was the first white person to attempt to civilize Native Americans. He built a jail and a gallows and claimed to have a great influence on the native population. However, he died after attending the hanging of the first white man in America.\\n\\nThe next notable ancestor mentioned is Charles Henry Twain, who lived in the late seventeenth century and was a missionary.

The ancestor is often credited with saying that he believed the Great Spirit was protecting Washington and therefore could not shoot him. However, the narrator suggests that the real reason for Pah-go-to-wah-wah-pukketekeewis stopping at the seventeenth shot was because he believed Washington was too drunk to hit and did not want to waste any more ammunition.\\n\\nThe narrator briefly mentions other ancestors who are well-known historical figures such as Guy Fawkes, Sixteen-String Jack, and Jack Sheppard, among others. These ancestors took a somewhat less honorable path, often getting into trouble with the law.\\n\\nThe narrator concludes by stating that they find their own life story to be ordinary compared to the exploits of their ancestors.

In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack--but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: I was skillful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.\\nIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting party-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.\\nI said to him: \\\"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\\\"\\n\\\"How?\\\" said he. \\\"Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival!\\\"\\n\\\"I have my doubts,\\\" I replied; \\\"and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\\\"\\n\\\"Amontillado!\\\"\\n\\\"I have my doubts.\\\"\\n\\\"Amontillado!\\\"\\n\\\"And I must satisfy them.\\\"\\n\\\"Amontillado!\\\"\\n\\\"As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a critical turn, it is he. He will tell me-- \\\"\\n\\\"Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\\\"\\n\\\"And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.\\\"\\n\\\"Come, let us go.\\\"\\n\\\"Whither?\\\"\\n\\\"To your vaults.\\\"\\n\\\"My friend, no. I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you have an engagement. Luchesi--\\\"\\n\\\"I have no engagement--come.\\\"\\n\\\"My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.\\\"\\n\\\"Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.\\\"\\nThus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask of black silk, and drawing a roquelaure closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.\\nThere were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.\\nI took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.\\nThe gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.\\n\\\"The pipe,\\\" said he.\\n\\\"It is farther on,\\\" said I; \\\"but observe the white webwork which gleams from these cavern walls.\\\"\\nHe turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.\\n\\\"Nitre?\\\" he asked, at length.\\n\\\"Nitre,\\\" I replied. \\\"How long have you had that cough?\\\"\\n\\\"Ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh!\\\"\\nMy poor friend found it impossible to reply. for many minutes.\\n\\\"It is nothing,\\\" he said at last.\\n\\\"Come,\\\" I said, with decision, \\\"we will go back; your health is precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is Luchesi--\\\"\\n\\\"Enough,\\\" he said: \\\"the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I shall not die of a cough.\\\"\\n\\\"True--true.\\\" I replied; \\\"and indeed, I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.\\\"\\nHere I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.\\n\\\"Drink,\\\" I said, presenting him the wine.\\nHe raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.\\n\\\"I drink,\\\" he said, \\\"to the buried that repose around us.\\\"\\n\\\"And I to your long life.\\\"\\nHe again took my arm, and we proceeded.\\n\\\"These vaults,\\\" he said, \\\"are extensive.\\\"\\n\\\"The Montresors,\\\" I replied, \\\"were a great and numerous family.\\\"\\n\\\"I forget your arms.\\\"\\n\\\"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are embedded in the heel.\\\"\\n\\\"And the motto?\\\"\\n\\\"Nemo me impune lacessit.\\\"\\n\\\"Good!\\\" he said.\\nThe wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.\\n\\\"The nitre!\\\" I said; \\\"see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the vaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough--\\\"\\n\\\"It is nothing,\\\" he said; \\\"let us go on. But first, another draught of the Medoc.\\\"\\nI broke and reached him a flagon of De Gr\\u00e2ve. He emptied it at a breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed, and threw the bottle upward with a gesticulation I did not understand.\\nI looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.\\n\\\"You do not comprehend?\\\" he said.\\n\\\"Not I,\\\" I replied.\\n\\\"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\\\"\\n\\\"How?\\\"\\n\\\"You are not of the masons.\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, yes,\\\" I said, \\\"yes, yes.\\\"\\n\\\"You? Impossible! A mason?\\\"\\n\\\"A mason,\\\" I replied.\\n\\\"A sign,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"It is this,\\\" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaure.\\n\\\"You jest,\\\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. \\\"But let us proceed to the Amontillado.\\\"\\n\\\"Be it so,\\\" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and, descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.\\nAt the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones we perceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.\\nIt was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored to pry into the depth of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.\\n\\\"Proceed,\\\" I said; \\\"herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi--\\\"\\n\\\"He is an ignoramus,\\\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key, I stepped back from the recess.\\n\\\"Pass your hand,\\\" I said, \\\"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre. Indeed it is very damp. Once more let me implore you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power.\\\"\\n\\\"The Amontillado!\\\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.\\n\\\"True,\\\" I replied; \\\"the Amontillado.\\\"\\nAs I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building-stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.\\nI had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was not the cry of a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the masonwork, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.\\nA succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a brief moment I hesitated--I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him who clamoured. I re\\u00ebchoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamourer grew still.\\nIt was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice said:\\n\\\"Ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he! he!--over our wine--he! he! he!\\\"\\n\\\"The Amontillado!\\\" I said.\\n\\\"He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado. But is it not getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo--the Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.\\\"\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" I said, \\\"let us be gone.\\\"\\n\\\"For the love of God, Montresor!\\\"\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" I said, \\\"for the love of God!\\\"\\nBut to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I called aloud:\\n\\\"Fortunato!\\\"\\nNo answer. I called again:\\n\\\"Fortunato!\\\"\\nNo answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick--on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I hastened to make an end of my labour. I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re\\u00ebrected the old rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them.

Fortunato insists on accompanying him to taste the wine and prove his expertise, despite objections about the dampness and cold in the catacombs where the wine is stored. The protagonist flatters Fortunato's rival, Luchesi, and says he will ask him to taste the wine instead, but Fortunato insists on going.\\n\\nThe narrator leads Fortunato through his empty home, grabs torches, and they descend into the catacombs. As they go deeper, Fortunato's drunkenness becomes more apparent, but the protagonist keeps offering him wine to keep him going. They reach a small, private crypt, and Fortunato is chained to the wall. It is revealed that the protagonist has been planning this revenge for a long time and that his friendly demeanor was just a facade. He starts to brick up the entrance of the crypt, trapping Fortunato inside.\\n\\nAs the protagonist walls up the entrance, Fortunato sobers up and becomes terrified. He pleads for mercy, but the protagonist continues to build the wall, mocking Fortunato's fear.

Then, holding it in front of his eyes, he let the light from the lamp stream through it, smelled it, tasted a few drops and smacked his lips with relish. Then he said:\\n\\\"Ah! the charming poison! Or rather the seductive murderer, the delightful destroyer of peoples!\\n\\\"You people do not know it the way I do. You may have read that admirable book entitled L'Assommoir, but you have not, as I have, seen alcohol exterminate a whole tribe of savages, a little kingdom of negroes--alcohol calmly unloaded by the barrel by red-bearded English seamen.\\n\\\"Right near here, in a little village in Brittany near Pont-l'Abbe, I once witnessed a strange and terrible tragedy caused by alcohol. I was spending my vacation in a little country house left me by my father. You know this flat coast where the wind whistles day and night, where one sees, standing or prone, these giant rocks which in the olden times were regarded as guardians, and which still retain something majestic and imposing about them. I always expect to see them come to life and start to walk across the country with the slow and ponderous tread of giants, or to unfold enormous granite wings and fly toward the paradise of the Druids.\\n\\\"Everywhere is the sea, always ready on the slightest provocation to rise in its anger and shake its foamy mane at those bold enough to brave its wrath.\\n\\\"And the men who travel on this terrible sea, which, with one motion of its green back, can overturn and swallow up their frail barks--they go out in the little boats, day and night, hardy, weary and drunk. They are often drunk. They have a saying which says: 'When the bottle is full you see the reef, but when it is empty you see it no more.'\\n\\\"Go into one of their huts; you will never find the father there. If you ask the woman what has become of her husband, she will stretch her arms out over the dark ocean which rumbles and roars along the coast. He remained, there one night, when he had had too much to drink; so did her oldest son. She has four more big, strong, fair-haired boys. Soon it will be their time.\\n\\\"As I said, I was living in a little house near Pont-l'Abbe. I was there alone with my servant, an old sailor, and with a native family which took care of the grounds in my absence. It consisted of three persons, two sisters and a man, who had married one of them, and who attended to the garden.\\n\\\"A short time before Christmas my gardener's wife presented him with a boy. The husband asked me to stand as god-father. I could hardly deny the request, and so he borrowed ten francs from me for the cost of the christening, as he said.\\n\\\"The second day of January was chosen as the date of the ceremony. For a week the earth had been covered by an enormous white carpet of snow, which made this flat, low country seem vast and limitless. The ocean appeared to be black in contrast with this white plain; one could see it rolling, raging and tossing its waves as though wishing to annihilate its pale neighbor, which appeared to be dead, it was so calm, quiet and cold.\\n\\\"At nine o'clock the father, Kerandec, came to my door with his sister-in-law, the big Kermagan, and the nurse, who carried the infant wrapped up in a blanket. We started for the church. The weather was so cold that it seemed to dry up the skin and crack it open. I was thinking of the poor little creature who was being carried on ahead of us, and I said to myself that this Breton race must surely be of iron, if their children were able, as soon as they were born, to stand such an outing.\\n\\\"We came to the church, but the door was closed; the priest was late.\\n\\\"Then the nurse sat down on one of the steps and began to undress the child. At first I thought there must have been some slight accident, but I saw that they were leaving the poor little fellow naked completely naked, in the icy air. Furious at such imprudence, I protested:\\n\\\"'Why, you are crazy! You will kill the child!'\\n\\\"The woman answered quietly: 'Oh, no, sir; he must wait naked before the Lord.'\\n\\\"The father and the aunt looked on undisturbed. It was the custom. If it were not adhered to misfortune was sure to attend the little one.\\n\\\"I scolded, threatened and pleaded. I used force to try to cover the frail creature. All was in vain. The nurse ran away from me through the snow, and the body of the little one turned purple. I was about to leave these brutes when I saw the priest coming across the country, followed by the sexton and a young boy. I ran towards him and gave vent to my indignation. He showed no surprise nor did he quicken his pace in the least. He answered:\\n\\\"'What can you expect, sir? It's the custom. They all do it, and it's of no use trying to stop them.'\\n\\\"'But at least hurry up!' I cried.\\n\\\"He answered: 'But I can't go any faster.'\\n\\\"He entered the vestry, while we remained outside on the church steps. I was suffering. But what about the poor little creature who was howling from the effects of the biting cold.\\n\\\"At last the door opened. He went into the church. But the poor child had to remain naked throughout the ceremony. It was interminable. The priest stammered over the Latin words and mispronounced them horribly. He walked slowly and with a ponderous tread. His white surplice chilled my heart. It seemed as though, in the name of a pitiless and barbarous god, he had wrapped himself in another kind of snow in order to torture this little piece of humanity that suffered so from the cold.\\n\\\"Finally the christening was finished according to the rites and I saw the nurse once more take the frozen, moaning child and wrap it up in the blanket.\\n\\\"The priest said to me: 'Do you wish to sign the register?'\\n\\\"Turning to my gardener, I said: \\\"Hurry up and get home quickly so that you can warm that child.' I gave him some advice so as to ward off, if not too late, a bad attack of pneumonia. He promised to follow my instructions and left with his sister-in-law and the nurse. I followed the priest into the vestry, and when I had signed he demanded five francs for expenses.\\n\\\"As I had already given the father ten francs, I refused to pay twice. The priest threatened to destroy the paper and to annul the ceremony. I, in turn, threatened him with the district attorney. The dispute was long, and I finally paid five francs.\\n\\\"As soon as I reached home I went down to Kerandec's to find out whether everything was all right. Neither father, nor sister-in-law, nor nurse had yet returned. The mother, who had remained alone, was in bed, shivering with cold and starving, for she had had nothing to eat since the day before.\\n\\\"'Where the deuce can they have gone?' I asked. She answered without surprise or anger, 'They're going to drink something to celebrate: It was the custom. Then I thought, of my ten francs which were to pay the church and would doubtless pay for the alcohol.\\n\\\"I sent some broth to the mother and ordered a good fire to be built in the room. I was uneasy and furious and promised myself to drive out these brutes, wondering with terror what was going to happen to the poor infant.\\n\\\"It was already six, and they had not yet returned. I told my servant to wait for them and I went to bed. I soon fell asleep and slept like a top. At daybreak I was awakened by my servant, who was bringing me my hot water.\\n\\\"As soon as my eyes were open I asked: 'How about Kerandec?'\\n\\\"The man hesitated and then stammered: 'Oh! he came back, all right, after midnight, and so drunk that he couldn't walk, and so were Kermagan and the nurse. I guess they must have slept in a ditch, for the little one died and they never even noticed it.'\\n\\\"I jumped up out of bed, crying:\\n\\\"'What! The child is dead?'\\n\\\"'Yes, sir. They brought it back to Mother Kerandec. When she saw it she began to cry, and now they are making her drink to console her.'\\n\\\"'What's that? They are making her drink!'\\n\\\"'Yes, sir. I only found it out this morning. As Kerandec had no more brandy or money, he took some wood alcohol, which monsieur gave him for the lamp, and all four of them are now drinking that. The mother is feeling pretty sick now.'\\n\\\"I had hastily put on some clothes, and seizing a stick, with the intention of applying it to the backs of these human beasts, I hastened towards the gardener's house.\\n\\\"The mother was raving drunk beside the blue body of her dead baby. Kerandec, the nurse, and the Kermagan woman were snoring on the floor. I had to take care of the mother, who died towards noon.\\\"\\nThe old doctor was silent. He took up the brandy-bottle and poured out another glass. He held it up to the lamp, and the light streaming through it imparted to the liquid the amber color of molten topaz. With one gulp he swallowed the treacherous drink.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story revolves around an old ship's surgeon who tells a doctor about a tragic event he witnessed in Brittany.

He describes the area, with its flat coastline and powerful, unpredictable ocean. He explains that the local men, who face dangerous conditions at sea, often turn to alcohol to cope. They have a saying that when the bottle is full, they can see the reef, but when it is empty, they no longer see the dangers.\\n\\nThe surgeon then tells the doctor about the event that unfolded near his vacation home. The gardener's wife gave birth to a baby boy, and the gardener asked the surgeon to be the godfather. They planned to have the christening on the second day of January. However, on that day, the church door was closed, and they had to wait for the priest to arrive.\\n\\nWhile waiting, the surgeon noticed that the nurse undressed the baby, leaving it completely naked in the freezing cold. Infuriated, the surgeon protested, but the nurse explained that it was a custom to present the child naked before the Lord. The surgeon pleaded and scolded, but the nurse remained firm in her belief that failure to adhere to the custom would bring misfortune.\\n\\nWhen the priest eventually arrived, he walked slowly and performed the christening ceremony while the baby shivered from the cold.

He found the mother alone, shivering and starving in bed. When he asked where the others were, she casually explained that they had gone to celebrate with alcohol, as was customary. The surgeon realized that the money he had given for the church likely went towards buying alcohol.\\n\\nBy morning, the gardener had returned, extremely drunk and unable to walk properly. The surgeon's servant informed him that the baby had died, and the gardener and his companions didn't even notice.

The peasants doubtless attached to this word, \\\"Manor,\\\" a meaning of wealth and of splendor, for this farm was undoubtedly the largest, richest and the best managed in the whole neighborhood.\\nThe immense court, surrounded by five rows of magnificent trees, which sheltered the delicate apple trees from the harsh wind of the plain, inclosed in its confines long brick buildings used for storing fodder and grain, beautiful stables built of hard stone and made to accommodate thirty horses, and a red brick residence which looked like a little chateau.\\nThanks for the good care taken, the manure heaps were as little offensive as such things can be; the watch-dogs lived in kennels, and countless poultry paraded through the tall grass.\\nEvery day, at noon, fifteen persons, masters, farmhands and the women folks, seated themselves around the long kitchen table where the soup was brought in steaming in a large, blue-flowered bowl.\\nThe beasts-horses, cows, pigs and sheep-were fat, well fed and clean. Maitre Lucas, a tall man who was getting stout, would go round three times a day, overseeing everything and thinking of everything.\\nA very old white horse, which the mistress wished to keep until its natural death, because she had brought it up and had always used it, and also because it recalled many happy memories, was housed, through sheer kindness of heart, at the end of the stable.\\nA young scamp about fifteen years old, Isidore Duval by name, and called, for convenience, Zidore, took care of this pensioner, gave him his measure of oats and fodder in winter, and in summer was supposed to change his pasturing place four times a day, so that he might have plenty of fresh grass.\\nThe animal, almost crippled, lifted with difficulty his legs, large at the knees and swollen above the hoofs. His coat, which was no longer curried, looked like white hair, and his long eyelashes gave to his eyes a sad expression.\\nWhen Zidore took the animal to pasture, he had to pull on the rope with all his might, because it walked so slowly; and the youth, bent over and out of breath, would swear at it, exasperated at having to care for this old nag.\\nThe farmhands, noticing the young rascal's anger against Coco, were amused and would continually talk of the horse to Zidore, in order to exasperate him. His comrades would make sport with him. In the village he was called Coco-Zidore.\\nThe boy would fume, feeling an unholy desire to revenge himself on the horse. He was a thin, long-legged, dirty child, with thick, coarse, bristly red hair. He seemed only half-witted, and stuttered as though ideas were unable to form in his thick, brute-like mind.\\nFor a long time he had been unable to understand why Coco should be kept, indignant at seeing things wasted on this useless beast. Since the horse could no longer work, it seemed to him unjust that he should be fed; he revolted at the idea of wasting oats, oats which were so expensive, on this paralyzed old plug. And often, in spite of the orders of Maitre Lucas, he would economize on the nag's food, only giving him half measure. Hatred grew in his confused, childlike mind, the hatred of a stingy, mean, fierce, brutal and cowardly peasant.\\nWhen summer came he had to move the animal about in the pasture. It was some distance away. The rascal, angrier every morning, would start, with his dragging step, across the wheat fields. The men working in the fields would shout to him, jokingly:\\n\\\"Hey, Zidore, remember me to Coco.\\\"\\nHe would not answer; but on the way he would break off a switch, and, as soon as he had moved the old horse, he would let it begin grazing; then, treacherously sneaking up behind it, he would slash its legs. The animal would try to escape, to kick, to get away from the blows, and run around in a circle about its rope, as though it had been inclosed in a circus ring. And the boy would slash away furiously, running along behind, his teeth clenched in anger.\\nThen he would go away slowly, without turning round, while the horse watched him disappear, his ribs sticking out, panting as a result of his unusual exertions. Not until the blue blouse of the young peasant was out of sight would he lower his thin white head to the grass.\\nAs the nights were now warm, Coco was allowed to sleep out of doors, in the field behind the little wood. Zidore alone went to see him. The boy threw stones at him to amuse himself. He would sit down on an embankment about ten feet away and would stay there about half an hour, from time to time throwing a sharp stone at the old horse, which remained standing tied before his enemy, watching him continually and not daring to eat before he was gone.\\nThis one thought persisted in the mind of the young scamp: \\\"Why feed this horse, which is no longer good for anything?\\\" It seemed to him that this old nag was stealing the food of the others, the goods of man and God, that he was even robbing him, Zidore, who was working.\\nThen, little by little, each day, the boy began to shorten the length of rope which allowed the horse to graze.\\nThe hungry animal was growing thinner, and starving. Too feeble to break his bonds, he would stretch his head out toward the tall, green, tempting grass, so near that he could smell, and yet so far that he could not touch it.\\nBut one morning Zidore had an idea: it was, not to move Coco any more. He was tired of walking so far for that old skeleton. He came, however, in order to enjoy his vengeance. The beast watched him anxiously. He did not beat him that day. He walked around him with his hands in his pockets. He even pretended to change his place, but he sank the stake in exactly the same hole, and went away overjoyed with his invention.\\nThe horse, seeing him leave, neighed to call him back; but the rascal began to run, leaving him alone, entirely alone in his field, well tied down and without a blade of grass within reach.\\nStarving, he tried to reach the grass which he could touch with the end of his nose. He got on his knees, stretching out his neck and his long, drooling lips. All in vain. The old animal spent the whole day in useless, terrible efforts. The sight of all that green food, which stretched out on all sides of him, served to increase the gnawing pangs of hunger.\\nThe scamp did not return that day. He wandered through the woods in search of nests.\\nThe next day he appeared upon the scene again. Coco, exhausted, had lain down. When he saw the boy, he got up, expecting at last to have his place changed.\\nBut the little peasant did not even touch the mallet, which was lying on the ground. He came nearer, looked at the animal, threw at his head a clump of earth which flattened out against the white hair, and he started off again, whistling.\\nThe horse remained standing as long as he could see him; then, knowing that his attempts to reach the near-by grass would be hopeless, he once more lay down on his side and closed his eyes.\\nThe following day Zidore did not come.\\nWhen he did come at last, he found Coco still stretched out; he saw that he was dead.\\nThen he remained standing, looking at him, pleased with what he had done, surprised that it should already be all over. He touched him with his foot, lifted one of his legs and then let it drop, sat on him and remained there, his eyes fixed on the grass, thinking of nothing. He returned to the farm, but did not mention the accident, because he wished to wander about at the hours when he used to change the horse's pasture. He went to see him the next day. At his approach some crows flew away. Countless flies were walking over the body and were buzzing around it. When he returned home, he announced the event. The animal was so old that nobody was surprised. The master said to two of the men:\\n\\\"Take your shovels and dig a hole right where he is.\\\"\\nThe men buried the horse at the place where he had died of hunger.

A young boy named Zidore is assigned the responsibility of taking care of Coco. However, Zidore despises the horse and resents the fact that resources, such as food, are being wasted on an animal that can no longer work.\\n\\nAs the summer arrives, Zidore is tasked with moving Coco to different pastures throughout the day. However, instead of fulfilling his duties properly, Zidore grows increasingly angry and begins to mistreat the old horse. He slashes Coco's legs with a switch, lets him starve by shortening his grazing rope, and throws stones at him for his own amusement.\\n\\nZidore's cruelty continues until one day he decides to no longer move Coco to different pastures.

Zidore revels in witnessing the horse's futile attempts to reach the tantalizing blades of grass just out of his range.\\n\\nOne day, Zidore comes up with an idea. Instead of moving Coco to graze, he leaves him in the same spot but plays pretend by pretending to change his place. This causes Coco to remain stranded, tied down without access to any grass.

Henry\", \"story\": \"Every Saturday night the Clover Leaf Social Club gave a hop in the hall of the Give and Take Athletic Association on the East Side. In order to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the Give and Take--or, if you belong to the division that starts off with the right foot in waltzing, you must work in Rhinegold's paper-box factory. Still, any Clover Leaf was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance. But mostly each Give and Take brought the paper-box girl that he affected; and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops.\\nMaggie Toole, on account of her dull eyes, broad mouth and left- handed style of footwork in the twostep, went to the dances with Anna McCarty and her \\\"fellow.\\\" Anna and Maggie worked side by side in the factory, and were the greatest chums ever. So Anna always made Jimmy Burns take her by Maggie's house every Saturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them.\\nThe Give and Take Athletic Association lived up to its name. The hall of the association in Orchard street was fitted out with muscle-making inventions. With the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous combat. Between these more serious occupations the Saturday night hop with the paper-box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen. For sometimes the tip went 'round, and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter-weight affair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes.\\nOn Saturdays Rhinegold's paper-box factory closed at 3 P. M. On one such afternoon Anna and Maggie walked homeward together. At Maggie's door Anna said, as usual: \\\"Be ready at seven, sharp, Mag; and Jimmy and we'll come by for you.\\\"\\nBut what was this? Instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the non-escorted one there was to be perceived a high- poised head, a prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth, and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye.\\n\\\"Thanks, Anna,\\\" said Maggie; \\\"but you and Jimmy needn't bother to-night. I've a gentleman friend that's coming 'round to escort me to the hop.\\\"\\nThe comely Anna pounced upon her friend, shook her, chided and beseeched her. Maggie Toole catch a fellow! Plain, dear, loyal, unattractive Maggie, so sweet as a chum, so unsought for a two-step or a moonlit bench in the little park. How was it? When did it happen? Who was it?\\n\\\"You'll see to-night,\\\" said Maggie, flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had gathered in Cupid's vineyard. \\\"He's swell all right. He's two inches taller than Jimmy, and an up-to-date dresser. I'll introduce him, Anna, just as soon as we get to the hall.\\\"\\nAnna and Jimmy were among the first Clover Leafs to arrive that evening. Anna's eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friend's \\\"catch.\\\"\\nAt 8:30 Miss Toole swept into the hall with her escort. Quickly her triumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful Jimmy.\\n\\\"Oh, gee!\\\" cried Anna, \\\"Mag ain't made a hit--oh, no! Swell fellow? well, I guess! Style? Look at 'um.\\\"\\n\\\"Go as far as you like,\\\" said Jimmy, with sandpaper in his voice. \\\"Cop him out if you want him. These new guys always win out with the push. Don't mind me. He don't squeeze all the limes, I guess. Huh!\\\"\\n\\\"Shut up, Jimmy. You know what I mean. I'm glad for Mag. First fellow she ever had. Oh, here they come.\\\"\\nAcross the floor Maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser. And truly, her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum. He stood two inches taller than the average Give and Take athlete; his dark hair curled; his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles. The young men of the Clover Leaf Club pinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess, its achievements in hand-to-hand conflicts, and its preservation from the legal duress that constantly menaced it. The member of the association who would bind a paperbox maiden to his conquering chariot scorned to employ Beau Brummel airs. They were not considered honourable methods of warfare. The swelling biceps, the coat straining at its buttons over the chest, the air of conscious conviction of the supereminence of the male in the cosmogony of creation, even a calm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents in the gentle tourneys of Cupid--these were the approved arms and ammunition of the Clover Leaf gallants. They viewed, then, genuflexions and alluring poses of this visitor with their chins at a new angle.\\n\\\"A friend of mine, Mr. Terry O'Sullivan,\\\" was Maggie's formula of introduction. She led him around the room, presenting him to each new-arriving Clover Leaf. Almost was she pretty now, with the unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor and a kitten with its first mouse.\\n\\\"Maggie Toole's got a fellow at last,\\\" was the word that went round among the paper-box girls. \\\"Pipe Mag's floor-walker\\\"--thus the Give and Takes expressed their indifferent contempt.\\nUsually at the weekly hops Maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back. She felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a self- sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished. She had even grown used to noticing Anna joggle the reluctant Jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two-step.\\nBut to-night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six. Terry O'Sullivan was a victorious Prince Charming, and Maggie Toole winged her first butterfly flight. And though our tropes of fairyland be mixed with those of entomology they shall not spill one drop of ambrosia from the rose-crowned melody of Maggie's one perfect night.\\nThe girls besieged her for introductions to her \\\"fellow.\\\" The Clover Leaf young men, after two years of blindness, suddenly perceived charms in Miss Toole. They flexed their compelling muscles before her and bespoke her for the dance.\\nThus she scored; but to Terry O'Sullivan the honours of the evening fell thick and fast. He shook his curls; he smiled and went easily through the seven motions for acquiring grace in your own room before an open window ten minutes each day. He danced like a faun; he introduced manner and style and atmosphere; his words came trippingly upon his tongue, and--he waltzed twice in succession with the paper- box girl that Dempsey Donovan brought.\\nDempsey was the leader of the association. He wore a dress suit, and could chin the bar twice with one hand. He was one of \\\"Big Mike\\\" O'Sullivan's lieutenants, and was never troubled by trouble. No cop dared to arrest him. Whenever be broke a pushcart man's head or shot a member of the Heinrick B. Sweeney Outing and Literary Association in the kneecap, an officer would drop around and say:\\n\\\"The Cap'n 'd like to see ye a few minutes round to the office whin ye have time, Dempsey, me boy.\\\"\\nBut there would be sundry gentlemen there with large gold fob chains and black cigars; and somebody would tell a funny story, and then Dempsey would go back and work half an hour with the sixpound dumbbells. So, doing a tight-rope act on a wire stretched across Niagara was a safe terpsichorean performance compared with waltzing twice with Dempsey Donovan's paper-box girl. At 10 o'clock the jolly round face of \\\"Big Mike\\\" O'Sullivan shone at the door for five minutes upon the scene. He always looked in for five minutes, smiled at the girls and handed out real perfectos to the delighted boys.\\nDempsey Donovan was at his elbow instantly, talking rapidly. \\\"Big Mike\\\" looked carefully at the dancers, smiled, shook his head and departed.\\nThe music stopped. The dancers scattered to the chairs along the walls. Terry O'Sullivan, with his entrancing bow, relinquished a pretty girl in blue to her partner and started back to find Maggie. Dempsey intercepted him in the middle of the floor.\\nSome fine instinct that Rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly every one to turn and look at them--there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena. Two or three Give and Takes with tight coat sleeves drew nearer.\\n\\\"One moment, Mr. O'Sullivan,\\\" said Dempsey. \\\"I hope you're enjoying yourself. Where did you say you live?\\\"\\nThe two gladiators were well matched. Dempsey had, perhaps, ten pounds of weight to give away. The O'Sullivan had breadth with quickness. Dempsey had a glacial eye, a dominating slit of a mouth, an indestructible jaw, a complexion like a belle's and the coolness of a champion. The visitor showed more fire in his contempt and less control over his conspicuous sneer. They were enemies by the law written when the rocks were molten. They were each too splendid, too mighty, too incomparable to divide pre-eminence. One only must survive.\\n\\\"I live on Grand,\\\" said O'Sullivan, insolently; \\\"and no trouble to find me at home. Where do you live?\\\"\\nDempsey ignored the question.\\n\\\"You say your name's O'Sullivan,\\\" he went on. \\\"Well, 'Big Mike' says he never saw you before.\\\"\\n\\\"Lots of things he never saw,\\\" said the favourite of the hop.\\n\\\"As a rule,\\\" went on Dempsey, huskily sweet, \\\"O'Sullivans in this district know one another. You escorted one of our lady members here, and we want chance to make good. If you've got a family tree let's see a few historical O'Sullivan buds come out on it. Or do you want us to dig it out of you by the roots?\\\"\\n\\\"Suppose you mind your own business,\\\" suggested O'Sullivan, blandly.\\nDempsey's eye brightened. He held up an inspired forefinger as though a brilliant idea had struck him.\\n\\\"I've got it now,\\\" he said cordially. \\\"It was just a little mistake. You ain't no O'Sullivan. You are a ring-tailed monkey. Excuse us for not recognising you at first.\\\"\\nO'Sullivan's eye flashed. He made a quick movement, but Andy Geoghan was ready and caught his arm.\\nDempsey nodded at Andy and William McMahan, the secretary of the club, and walked rapidly toward a door at the rear of the hall. Two other members of the Give and Take Association swiftly joined the little group. Terry O'Sullivan was now in the hands of the Board of Rules and Social Referees. They spoke to him briefly and softly, and conducted him out through the same door at the rear.\\nThis movement on the part of the Clover Leaf members requires a word of elucidation. Back of the association hall was a smaller room rented by the club. In this room personal difficulties that arose on the ballroom floor were settled, man to man, with the weapons of nature, under the supervision of the board. No lady could say that she had witnessed a fight at a Clover Leaf hop in several years. Its gentlemen members guaranteed that.\\nSo easily and smoothly had Dempsey and the board done their preliminary work that many in the hall had not noticed the checking of the fascinating O'Sullivan's social triumph. Among these was Maggie. She looked about for her escort.\\n\\\"Smoke up!\\\" said Rose Cassidy. \\\"Wasn't you on? Demps Donovan picked a scrap with your Lizzie-boy, and they've waltzed out to the slaughter room with him. How's my hair look done up this way, Mag?\\\"\\nMaggie laid a hand on the bosom of her cheesecloth waist.\\n\\\"Gone to fight with Dempsey!\\\" she said, breathlessly. \\\"They've got to be stopped. Dempsey Donovan can't fight him. Why, he'll--he'll kill him!\\\"\\n\\\"Ah, what do you care?\\\" said Rosa. \\\"Don't some of 'em fight every hop?\\\"\\nBut Maggie was off, darting her zig-zag way through the maze of dancers. She burst through the rear door into the dark hall and then threw her solid shoulder against the door of the room of single combat. It gave way, and in the instant that she entered her eye caught the scene--the Board standing about with open watches; Dempsey Donovan in his shirt sleeves dancing, light-footed, with the wary grace of the modern pugilist, within easy reach of his adversary; Terry O'Sullivan standing with arms folded and a murderous look in his dark eyes. And without slacking the speed of her entrance she leaped forward with a scream--leaped in time to catch and hang upon the arm of O'Sullivan that was suddenly uplifted, and to whisk from it the long, bright stiletto that he had drawn from his bosom.\\nThe knife fell and rang upon the floor. Cold steel drawn in the rooms of the Give and Take Association! Such a thing had never happened before. Every one stood motionless for a minute. Andy Geoghan kicked the stiletto with the toe of his shoe curiously, like an antiquarian who has come upon some ancient weapon unknown to his learning.\\nAnd then O'Sullivan hissed something unintelligible between his teeth. Dempsey and the board exchanged looks. And then Dempsey looked at O'Sullivan without anger, as one looks at a stray dog, and nodded his head in the direction of the door.\\n\\\"The back stairs, Giuseppi,\\\" he said, briefly. \\\"Somebody'll pitch your hat down after you.\\\"\\nMaggie walked up to Dempsey Donovan. There was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks, down which slow tears were running. But she looked him bravely in the eye.\\n\\\"I knew it, Dempsey,\\\" she said, as her eyes grew dull even in their tears. \\\"I knew he was a Guinea. His name's Tony Spinelli. I hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin'. Them Guineas always carries knives. But you don't understand, Dempsey. I never had a fellow in my life. I got tired of comin' with Anna and Jimmy every night, so I fixed it with him to call himself O'Sullivan, and brought him along. I knew there'd be nothin' doin' for him if he came as a Dago. I guess I'll resign from the club now.\\\"\\nDempsey turned to Andy Geoghan.\\n\\\"Chuck that cheese slicer out of the window,\\\" he said, \\\"and tell 'em inside that Mr. O'Sullivan has had a telephone message to go down to Tammany Hall.\\\"\\nAnd then he turned back to Maggie.\\n\\\"Say, Mag,\\\" he said, \\\"I'll see you home. And how about next Saturday night? Will you come to the hop with me if I call around for you?\\\"\\nIt was remarkable how quickly Maggie's eyes could change from dull to a shining brown.\\n\\\"With you, Dempsey?\\\" she stammered. \\\"Say--will a duck swim?\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In this story, the Clover Leaf Social Club holds a dance every Saturday night.

Each carried two zinc pails, slung outwards from the body on a hoop from a cask; at each step the metal sent out a dazzling white flash under the sun that struck full upon it.\\nThe women did not speak. They were on their way to milk the cows. When they arrive, they set down one of their pails and approach the first two cows, making them stand up with a kick in the ribs from wooden-shod feet. The beast rises slowly, first on its forelegs, then with more difficulty raises its large hind quarters, which seem to be weighted down by the enormous udder of livid pendulous flesh.\\nThe two Malivoires, mother and daughter, kneeling beneath the animal's belly, tug with a swift movement of their hands at the swollen teat, which at each squeeze sends a slender jet of milk into the pail. The yellowish froth mounts to the brim, and the women go from cow to cow until they reach the end of the long line.\\nAs soon as they finish milking a beast, they change its position, giving it a fresh patch of grass on which to graze.\\nThen they start on their way home, more slowly now, weighed down by the load of milk, the mother in front, the daughter behind.\\nAbruptly the latter halts, sets down her burden, Sits down, and begins to cry.\\nMadame Malivoire, missing the sound of steps behind her, turns round and is quite amazed.\\n\\\"What's the matter with you?\\\" she said.\\nHer daughter Celeste, a tall girl with flaming red hair and flaming cheeks, flecked with freckles as though sparks of fire had fallen upon her face one day as she worked in the sun, murmurs, moaning softly, like a beaten child:\\n\\\"I can't carry the milk any further.\\\"\\nHer mother looked at her suspiciously.\\n\\\"What's the matter with you?\\\" she repeated.\\n\\\"It drags too heavy, I can't,\\\" replied Celeste, who had collapsed and was lying on the ground between the two pails, hiding her eyes in her apron.\\n\\\"What's the matter with you, then?\\\" said her mother for the third time. The girl moaned:\\n\\\"I think there's a baby on the way.\\\" And she broke into sobs.\\nThe old woman now in her turn set down her load, so amazed that she could find nothing to say. At last she stammered:\\n\\\"You . . . you . . . you're going to have a baby, you clod! How can that be?\\\"\\nThe Malivoires were prosperous farmers, wealthy and of a certain position, widely respected, good business folk, of some importance in the district.\\n\\\"I think I am, all the same,\\\" faltered Celeste.\\nThe frightened mother looked at the weeping girl grovelling at her feet. After a few seconds she cried:\\n\\\"You're going to have a baby! A baby! Where did you get it, you slut?\\\"\\nCeleste, shaken with emotion, murmured:\\n\\\"I think it was in Polyte's coach.\\\"\\nThe old woman tried to understand, tried to imagine, to realise who could have brought this misfortune upon her daughter. If the lad was well off and of decent position, an arrangement might be come to. The damage could still be repaired. Celeste was not the first to be in the same way, but it was annoying all the same, seeing their position and the way people talked.\\n\\\"And who was it, you slut?\\\" she repeated.\\nCeleste, resolved to make a clean breast of it, stammered:\\n\\\"I think it was Polyte.\\\"\\nAt that Madame Malivoire, mad with rage, rushed upon her daughter and began to beat her with such fury that her hat fell off in the effort.\\nWith great blows of the fist she struck her on the head, on the back, all over her body; Celeste, prostrate between the two pails, which afforded her some slight protection, shielded just her face with her hands.\\nAll the cows, disturbed, had stopped grazing and turned round, staring with their great eyes. The last one mooed, stretching out its muzzle towards the women.\\nAfter beating her daughter till she was out of breath, Madame Malivoire stopped, exhausted; her spirits reviving a little, she tried to get a thorough understanding of the situation.\\n\\\"--- Polyte! Lord save us, it's not possible! How could you, with a carrier? You must have lost your wits. He must have played you a trick, the good-for-nothing!\\\"\\nCeleste, still prostrate, murmured in the dust:\\n\\\"I didn't pay my fare!\\\"\\nAnd the old Norman woman understood.\\nEvery week, on Wednesday and on Saturday, Celeste went to town with the farm produce, poultry, cream, and eggs.\\nShe started at seven with her two huge baskets on her arm, the dairy produce in one, the chickens in the other, and went to the main road to wait for the coach to Yvetot.\\nShe set down her wares and sat in the ditch, while the chickens with their short pointed beaks and the ducks with their broad flat bills thrust their heads between the wicker bars and looked about them with their round, stupid, surprised eyes.\\nSoon the bus, a sort of yellow box with a black leather cap on the top, came up, jerking and quivering with the trotting of the old white horse.\\nPolyte the coachman, a big, jolly fellow, stout though still young, and so burnt up by sun and wind, soaked by rain, and coloured with brandy that his face and neck were brick-red, cracked his whip and shouted from the distance:\\n\\\"Morning, Mam'selle Celeste. In good health, I hope?\\\"\\nShe gave him her baskets, one after the other, which he stowed in the boot; then she got in, lifting her leg high up to reach the step, and exposing a sturdy leg clad in a blue stocking.\\nEvery time Polyte repeated the same joke: \\\"Well, it's not got any thinner.\\\"\\nShe laughed, thinking this funny.\\nThen he uttered a \\\"Gee up, old girl!\\\" which started off the thin horse. Then Celeste, reaching for her purse in the depths of her pocket, slowly took out fivepence, threepence for herself and twopence for the baskets, and handed them to Polyte over his shoulder.\\nHe took them, saying:\\n\\\"Aren't we going to have our little bit of sport to-day?\\\"\\nAnd he laughed heartily, turning round towards her so as to stare at her at his ease.\\nShe found it a big expense, the half-franc for a journey of two miles. And when she had no coppers she felt it still more keenly; it was hard to make up her mind to part with a silver coin.\\nOne day, as she was paying, she asked:\\n\\\"From a good customer like me you oughtn't to take more than threepence.\\\"\\nHe burst out laughing.\\n\\\"Threepence, my beauty; why, you're worth more than that.\\\"\\nShe insisted on the point.\\n\\\"But you make a good two francs a month out of me.\\\"\\nHe whipped up his horse and exclaimed:\\n\\\"Look here, I'm an obliging fellow! We'll call it quits for a bit of sport.\\\"\\n\\\"What do you mean?\\\" she asked with an air of innocence.\\nHe was so amused that he laughed till he coughed.\\n\\\"A bit of sport is a bit of sport, damn it; a game for a lad and a lass, a dance for two without music.\\\"\\nShe understood, blushed, and declared:\\n\\\"I don't care for that sort of game, Monsieur Polyte.\\\"\\nBut he was in no way abashed, and repeated, with growing merriment:\\n\\\"You'll come to it some day, my beauty, a bit of sport for a lad and a lass!\\\"\\nAnd since that day he had taken to asking her, each time that she paid her fare:\\n\\\"Aren't we going to have our bit of sport to-day?\\\"\\nShe, too, joked about it by this time, and replied:\\n\\\"Not to-day, Monsieur Polyte, but Saturday, for certain!\\\"\\nAnd amid peals of laughter he answered:\\n\\\"Saturday, then, my beauty.\\\"\\nBut inwardly she calculated that, during the two years the affair had been going on, she had paid Polyte forty-eight whole francs, and in the country forty-eight francs is not a sum which can be picked up on the roadside; she also calculated that in two more years she would have paid nearly a hundred francs.\\nTo such purpose she meditated that, one spring day as they jogged on alone, when he made his customary inquiry: \\\"Aren't we going to have our bit of sport yet?\\\" She replied:\\n\\\"Yes, if you like, Monsieur Polyte.\\\"\\nHe was not at all surprised, and clambered over the back of his seat, murmuring with a complacent air:\\n\\\"Come along, then. I knew you'd come to it some day.\\\"\\nThe old white horse trotted so gently that she seemed to be dancing upon the same spot, deaf to the voice which cried at intervals, from the depths of the vehicle: \\\"Gee up, old girl! Gee up, then!\\\"\\nThree months later Celeste discovered that she was going to have a child.\\nAll this she had told her mother in a tearful voice. Pale with fury, the old woman asked:\\n\\\"Well, what did it cost?\\\"\\n\\\"Four months; that makes eight francs, doesn't it?\\\" replied Celeste.\\nAt that the peasant woman's fury was utterly unleashed, and, falling once more upon her daughter, she beat her a second time until she was out of breath. Then she rose and said:\\n\\\"Have you told him about the baby?\\\"\\n\\\"No, of course not.\\\"\\n\\\"Why haven't you told him?\\\"\\n\\\"Because very likely he'd have made me pay for all the free rides!\\\"\\nThe old woman pondered awhile, then picked up her milkpails.\\n\\\"Come on, get up, and try to walk home,\\\" she said, and, after a pause, continued:\\n\\\"And don't tell him as long as he doesn't notice anything, and we'll make six or eight months' fares out of him.\\\"\\nAnd Celeste, who had risen, still crying, dishevelled and swollen round the eyes, started off again with dragging steps, murmuring:\\n\\\"Of course I won't say.\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In this story, set in rural France, a mother and daughter are working on a farm, milking cows to collect milk.

On the sideboard behind her, two tall glasses, soda water, whiskey. Fresh ice cubes in the Thermos bucket.\\nMary Maloney was waiting for her husband to come home from work.\\nNow and again she would glance up at the clock, but without anxiety, merely to please herself with the thought that each minute gone by made it nearer the time when he would come. There was a slow smiling air about her, and about everything she did. The drop of a head as she bent over her sewing was curiously tranquil. Her skin--for this was her sixth month with child--had acquired a wonderful translucent quality, the mouth was soft, and the eyes, with their new placid look, seemed larger darker than before. When the clock said ten minutes to five, she began to listen, and a few moments later, punctually as always, she heard the tires on the gravel outside, and the car door slamming, the footsteps passing the window, the key turning in the lock. She laid aside her sewing, stood up, and went forward to kiss him as he came in.\\n\\\"Hullo darling,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"Hullo darling,\\\" he answered.\\nShe took his coat and hung it in the closet. Then she walked over and made the drinks, a strongish one for him, a weak one for herself; and soon she was back again in her chair with the sewing, and he in the other, opposite, holding the tall glass with both hands, rocking it so the ice cubes tinkled against the side.\\nFor her, this was always a blissful time of day. She knew he didn't want to speak much until the first drink was finished, and she, on her side, was content to sit quietly, enjoying his company after the long hours alone in the house. She loved to luxuriate in the presence of this man, and to feel-almost as a sunbather feels the sun-that warm male glow that came out of him to her when they were alone together. She loved him for the way he sat loosely in a chair, for the way he came in a door, or moved slowly across the room with long strides. She loved intent, far look in his eyes when they rested in her, the funny shape of the mouth, and especially the way he remained silent about his tiredness, sitting still with himself until the whiskey had taken some of it away.\\n\\\"Tired darling?\\\"\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm tired,\\\" And as he spoke, he did an unusual thing. He lifted his glass and drained it in one swallow although there was still half of it, at least half of it left.. She wasn't really watching him, but she knew what he had done because she heard the ice cubes falling back against the bottom of the empty glass when he lowered his arm. He paused a moment, leaning forward in the chair, then he got up and went slowly over to fetch himself another.\\n\\\"I'll get it!\\\" she cried, jumping up.\\n\\\"Sit down,\\\" he said.\\nWhen he came back, she noticed that the new drink was dark amber with the quantity of whiskey in it.\\n\\\"Darling, shall I get your slippers?\\\"\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\nShe watched him as he began to sip the dark yellow drink, and she could see little oily swirls in the liquid because it was so strong.\\n\\\"I think it's a shame,\\\" she said, \\\"that when a policeman gets to be as senior as you, they keep him walking about on his feet all day long.\\\"\\nHe didn't answer, so she bent her head again and went on with her sewing; but each time he lifted the drink to his lips, she heard the ice cubes clinking against the side of the glass.\\n\\\"Darling,\\\" she said. \\\"Would you like me to get you some cheese? I haven't made any supper because it's Thursday.\\\"\\n\\\"No,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"If you're too tired to eat out,\\\" she went on, \\\"it's still not too late. There's plenty of meat and stuff in the freezer, and you can have it right here and not even move out of the chair.\\\"\\nHer eyes waited on him for an answer, a smile, a little nod, but he made no sign.\\n\\\"Anyway,\\\" she went on, \\\"I'll get you some cheese and crackers first.\\\"\\n\\\"I don't want it,\\\" he said.\\nShe moved uneasily in her chair, the large eyes still watching his face. \\\"But you must eat! I'll fix it anyway, and then you can have it or not, as you like.\\\"\\nShe stood up and placed her sewing on the table by the lamp.\\n\\\"Sit down,\\\" he said. \\\"Just for a minute, sit down.\\\"\\nIt wasn't till then that she began to get frightened.\\n\\\"Go on,\\\" he said. \\\"Sit down.\\\"\\nShe lowered herself back slowly into the chair, watching him all the time with those large, bewildered eyes. He had finished the second drink and was staring down into the glass, frowning.\\n\\\"Listen,\\\" he said. \\\"I've got something to tell you.\\\"\\n\\\"What is it, darling? What's the matter?\\\"\\nHe had now become absolutely motionless, and he kept his head down so that the light from the lamp beside him fell across the upper part of his face, leaving the chin and mouth in shadow. She noticed there was a little muscle moving near the corner of his left eye.\\n\\\"This is going to be a bit of a shock to you, I'm afraid,\\\" he said. \\\"But I've thought about it a good deal and I've decided the only thing to do is tell you right away. I hope you won't blame me too much.\\\"\\nAnd he told her. It didn't take long, four or five minutes at most, and she say very still through it all, watching him with a kind of dazed horror as he went further and further away from her with each word.\\n\\\"So there it is,\\\" he added. \\\"And I know it's kind of a bad time to be telling you, bet there simply wasn't any other way. Of course I'll give you money and see you're looked after. But there needn't really be any fuss. I hope not anyway. It wouldn't be very good for my job.\\\"\\nHer first instinct was not to believe any of it, to reject it all. It occurred to her that perhaps he hadn't even spoken, that she herself had imagined the whole thing. Maybe, if she went about her business and acted as though she hadn't been listening, then later, when she sort of woke up again, she might find none of it had ever happened.\\n\\\"I'll get the supper,\\\" she managed to whisper, and this time he didn't stop her.\\nWhen she walked across the room she couldn't feel her feet touching the floor. She couldn't feel anything at all- except a slight nausea and a desire to vomit. Everything was automatic now-down the steps to the cellar, the light switch, the deep freeze, the hand inside the cabinet taking hold of the first object it met. She lifted it out, and looked at it. It was wrapped in paper, so she took off the paper and looked at it again.\\nA leg of lamb.\\nAll right then, they would have lamb for supper. She carried it upstairs, holding the thin bone-end of it with both her hands, and as she went through the living-room, she saw him standing over by the window with his back to her, and she stopped.\\n\\\"For God's sake,\\\" he said, hearing her, but not turning round. \\\"Don't make supper for me. I'm going out.\\\"\\nAt that point, Mary Maloney simply walked up behind him and without any pause she swung the big frozen leg of lamb high in the air and brought it down as hard as she could on the back of his head.\\nShe might just as well have hit him with a steel club.\\nShe stepped back a pace, waiting, and the funny thing was that he remained standing there for at least four or five seconds, gently swaying. Then he crashed to the carpet.\\nThe violence of the crash, the noise, the small table overturning, helped bring her out of he shock. She came out slowly, feeling cold and surprised, and she stood for a while blinking at the body, still holding the ridiculous piece of meat tight with both hands.\\nAll right, she told herself. So I've killed him.\\nIt was extraordinary, now, how clear her mind became all of a sudden. She began thinking very fast. As the wife of a detective, she knew quite well what the penalty would be. That was fine. It made no difference to her. In fact, it would be a relief. On the other hand, what about the child? What were the laws about murderers with unborn children? Did they kill then both-mother and child? Or did they wait until the tenth month? What did they do?\\nMary Maloney didn't know. And she certainly wasn't prepared to take a chance.\\nShe carried the meat into the kitchen, placed it in a pan, turned the oven on high, and shoved t inside. Then she washed her hands and ran upstairs to the bedroom. She sat down before the mirror, tidied her hair, touched up her lops and face. She tried a smile. It came out rather peculiar. She tried again.\\n\\\"Hullo Sam,\\\" she said brightly, aloud.\\nThe voice sounded peculiar too.\\n\\\"I want some potatoes please, Sam. Yes, and I think a can of peas.\\\"\\nThat was better. Both the smile and the voice were coming out better now. She rehearsed it several times more. Then she ran downstairs, took her coat, went out the back door, down the garden, into the street.\\nIt wasn't six o'clock yet and the lights were still on in the grocery shop.\\n\\\"Hullo Sam,\\\" she said brightly, smiling at the man behind the counter.\\n\\\"Why, good evening, Mrs. Maloney. How're you?\\\"\\n\\\"I want some potatoes please, Sam. Yes, and I think a can of peas.\\\"\\nThe man turned and reached up behind him on the shelf for the peas.\\n\\\"Patrick's decided he's tired and doesn't want to eat out tonight,\\\" she told him. \\\"We usually go out Thursdays, you know, and now he's caught me without any vegetables in the house.\\\"\\n\\\"Then how about meat, Mrs. Maloney?\\\"\\n\\\"No, I've got meat, thanks. I got a nice leg of lamb from the freezer.\\\"\\n\\\"Oh.\\\"\\n\\\"I don't know much like cooking it frozen, Sam, but I'm taking a chance on it this time. You think it'll be all right?\\\"\\n\\\"Personally,\\\" the grocer said, \\\"I don't believe it makes any difference. You want these Idaho potatoes?\\\"\\n\\\"Oh yes, that'll be fine. Two of those.\\\"\\n\\\"Anything else?\\\" The grocer cocked his head on one side, looking at her pleasantly. \\\"How about afterwards? What you going to give him for afterwards?\\\"\\n\\\"Well-what would you suggest, Sam?\\\"\\nThe man glanced around his shop. \\\"How about a nice big slice of cheesecake? I know he likes that.\\\"\\n\\\"Perfect,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves it.\\\"\\nAnd when it was all wrapped and she had paid, she put on her brightest smile and said, \\\"Thank you, Sam. Goodnight.\\\"\\n\\\"Goodnight, Mrs. Maloney. And thank you.\\\"\\nAnd now, she told herself as she hurried back, all she was doing now, she was returning home to her husband and he was waiting for his supper; and she must cook it good, and make it as tasty as possible because the poor man was tired; and if, when she entered the house, she happened to find anything unusual, or tragic, or terrible, then naturally it would be a shock and she'd become frantic with grief and horror. Mind you, she wasn't expecting to find anything. She was just going home with the vegetables. Mrs. Patrick Maloney going home with the vegetables on Thursday evening to cook supper for her husband.\\nThat's the way, she told herself. Do everything right and natural. Keep things absolutely natural and there'll be no need for any acting at all.\\nTherefore, when she entered the kitchen by the back door, she was humming a little tune to herself and smiling.\\n\\\"Patrick!\\\" she called. \\\"How are you, darling?\\\"\\nShe put the parcel down on the table and went through into the living room; and when she saw him lying there on the floor with his legs doubled up and one arm twisted back underneath his body, it really was rather a shock. All the old love and longing for him welled up inside her, and she ran over to him, knelt down beside him, and began to cry her heart out. It was easy. No acting was necessary.\\nA few minutes later she got up and went to the phone. She know the number of the police station, and when the man at the other end answered, she cried to him, \\\"Quick! Come quick! Patrick's dead!\\\"\\n\\\"Who's speaking?\\\"\\n\\\"Mrs. Maloney. Mrs. Patrick Maloney.\\\"\\n\\\"You mean Patrick Maloney's dead?\\\"\\n\\\"I think so,\\\" she sobbed. \\\"He's lying on the floor and I think he's dead.\\\"\\n\\\"Be right over,\\\" the man said.\\nThe car came very quickly, and when she opened the front door, two policeman walked in. She know them both-she know nearly all the man at that precinct-and she fell right into a chair, then went over to join the other one, who was called O'Malley, kneeling by the body.\\n\\\"Is he dead?\\\" she cried.\\n\\\"I'm afraid he is. What happened?\\\"\\nBriefly, she told her story about going out to the grocer and coming back to find him on the floor. While she was talking, crying and talking, Noonan discovered a small patch of congealed blood on the dead man's head. He showed it to O'Malley who got up at once and hurried to the phone.\\nSoon, other men began to come into the house. First a doctor, then two detectives, one of whom she know by name. Later, a police photographer arrived and took pictures, and a man who know about fingerprints. There was a great deal of whispering and muttering beside the corpse, and the detectives kept asking her a lot of questions. But they always treated her kindly. She told her story again, this time right from the beginning, when Patrick had come in, and she was sewing, and he was tired, so tired he hadn't wanted to go out for supper. She told how she'd put the meat in the oven-\\\"it's there now, cooking\\\"- and how she'd slopped out to the grocer for vegetables, and come back to find him lying on the floor.\\nWhich grocer?\\\" one of the detectives asked.\\nShe told him, and he turned and whispered something to the other detective who immediately went outside into the street.\\nIn fifteen minutes he was back with a page of notes, and there was more whispering, and through her sobbing she heard a few of the whispered phrases-\\\"...acted quite normal...very cheerful...wanted to give him a good supper...peas...cheesecake...impossible that she...\\\"\\nAfter a while, the photographer and the doctor departed and two other men came in and took the corpse away on a stretcher. Then the fingerprint man went away. The two detectives remained, and so did the two policeman. They were exceptionally nice to her, and Jack Noonan asked if she wouldn't rather go somewhere else, to her sister's house perhaps, or to his own wife who would take care of her and put her up for the night.\\nNo, she said. She didn't feel she could move even a yard at the moment. Would they mind awfully of she stayed just where she was until she felt better. She didn't feel too good at the moment, she really didn't.\\nThen hadn't she better lie down on the bed? Jack Noonan asked.\\nNo, she said. She'd like to stay right where she was, in this chair. A little later, perhaps, when she felt better, she would move.\\nSo they left her there while they went about their business, searching the house. Occasionally on of the detectives asked her another question. Sometimes Jack Noonan spoke at her gently as he passed by. Her husband, he told her, had been killed by a blow on the back of the head administered with a heavy blunt instrument, almost certainly a large piece of metal. They were looking for the weapon. The murderer may have taken it with him, but on the other hand he may have thrown it away or hidden it somewhere on the premises.\\n\\\"It's the old story,\\\" he said. \\\"Get the weapon, and you've got the man.\\\"\\nLater, one of the detectives came up and sat beside her. Did she know, he asked, of anything in the house that could've been used as the weapon? Would she mind having a look around to see if anything was missing-a very big spanner, for example, or a heavy metal vase.\\nThey didn't have any heavy metal vases, she said.\\n\\\"Or a big spanner?\\\"\\nShe didn't think they had a big spanner. But there might be some things like that in the garage.\\nThe search went on. She knew that there were other policemen in the garden all around the house. She could hear their footsteps on the gravel outside, and sometimes she saw a flash of a torch through a chink in the curtains. It began to get late, nearly nine she noticed by the clock on the mantle. The four men searching the rooms seemed to be growing weary, a trifle exasperated.\\n\\\"Jack,\\\" she said, the next tome Sergeant Noonan went by. \\\"Would you mind giving me a drink?\\\"\\n\\\"Sure I'll give you a drink. You mean this whiskey?\\\"\\n\\\"Yes please. But just a small one. It might make me feel better.\\\"\\nHe handed her the glass.\\n\\\"Why don't you have one yourself,\\\" she said. \\\"You must be awfully tired. Please do. You've been very good to me.\\\"\\n\\\"Well,\\\" he answered. \\\"It's not strictly allowed, but I might take just a drop to keep me going.\\\"\\nOne by one the others came in and were persuaded to take a little nip of whiskey. They stood around rather awkwardly with the drinks in their hands, uncomfortable in her presence, trying to say consoling things to her. Sergeant Noonan wandered into the kitchen, come out quickly and said, \\\"Look, Mrs. Maloney. You know that oven of yours is still on, and the meat still inside.\\\"\\n\\\"Oh dear me!\\\" she cried. \\\"So it is!\\\"\\n\\\"I better turn it off for you, hadn't I?\\\"\\n\\\"Will you do that, Jack. Thank you so much.\\\"\\nWhen the sergeant returned the second time, she looked at him with her large, dark tearful eyes. \\\"Jack Noonan,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"Yes?\\\"\\n\\\"Would you do me a small favor-you and these others?\\\"\\n\\\"We can try, Mrs. Maloney.\\\"\\n\\\"Well,\\\" she said. \\\"Here you all are, and good friends of dear Patrick's too, and helping to catch the man who killed him. You must be terrible hungry by now because it's long past your suppertime, and I know Patrick would never forgive me, God bless his soul, if I allowed you to remain in his house without offering you decent hospitality. Why don't you eat up that lamb that's in the oven. It'll be cooked just right by now.\\\"\\n\\\"Wouldn't dream of it,\\\" Sergeant Noonan said.\\n\\\"Please,\\\" she begged. \\\"Please eat it. Personally I couldn't tough a thing, certainly not what's been in the house when he was here. But it's all right for you. It'd be a favor to me if you'd eat it up. Then you can go on with your work again afterwards.\\\"\\nThere was a good deal of hesitating among the four policemen, but they were clearly hungry, and in the end they were persuaded to go into the kitchen and help themselves. The woman stayed where she was, listening to them speaking among themselves, their voices thick and sloppy because their mouths were full of meat.\\n\\\"Have some more, Charlie?\\\"\\n\\\"No. Better not finish it.\\\"\\n\\\"She wants us to finish it. She said so. Be doing her a favor.\\\"\\n\\\"Okay then. Give me some more.\\\"\\n\\\"That's the hell of a big club the gut must've used to hit poor Patrick,\\\" one of them was saying. \\\"The doc says his skull was smashed all to pieces just like from a sledgehammer.\\\"\\n\\\"That's why it ought to be easy to find.\\\"\\n\\\"Exactly what I say.\\\"\\n\\\"Whoever done it, they're not going to be carrying a thing like that around with them longer than they need.\\\"\\nOne of them belched.\\n\\\"Personally, I think it's right here on the premises.\\\"\\n\\\"Probably right under our very noses. What you think, Jack?\\\"\\nAnd in the other room, Mary Maloney began to giggle.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Mary Maloney is at home, waiting for her husband Patrick to come home from work. When he arrives, she greets him warmly and makes him a drink. As they sit together, Mary reflects on her love for Patrick and enjoys his company after a long day alone. However, Patrick seems tired and distant.\\n\\nSuddenly, Patrick tells Mary that he has something to tell her. He confesses that he is leaving her, shocking Mary. In a daze, she goes to the kitchen, grabs a frozen leg of lamb, walks back to where Patrick is standing, and hits him over the head with it.

Now she was resting in her bed, lying on her back, her eyes closed, her features calm, her long white hair carefully arranged as though she had done it up ten minutes before dying. The whole pale countenance of the dead woman was so collected, so calm, so resigned that one could feel what a sweet soul had lived in that body, what a quiet existence this old soul had led, how easy and pure the death of this parent had been.\\nKneeling beside the bed, her son, a magistrate with inflexible principles, and her daughter, Marguerite, known as Sister Eulalie, were weeping as though their hearts would break. She had, from childhood up, armed them with a strict moral code, teaching them religion, without weakness, and duty, without compromise. He, the man, had become a judge and handled the law as a weapon with which he smote the weak ones without pity. She, the girl, influenced by the virtue which had bathed her in this austere family, had become the bride of the Church through her loathing for man.\\nThey had hardly known their father, knowing only that he had made their mother most unhappy, without being told any other details.\\nThe nun was wildly-kissing the dead woman's hand, an ivory hand as white as the large crucifix lying across the bed. On the other side of the long body the other hand seemed still to be holding the sheet in the death grasp; and the sheet had preserved the little creases as a memory of those last movements which precede eternal immobility.\\nA few light taps on the door caused the two sobbing heads to look up, and the priest, who had just come from dinner, returned. He was red and out of breath from his interrupted digestion, for he had made himself a strong mixture of coffee and brandy in order to combat the fatigue of the last few nights and of the wake which was beginning.\\nHe looked sad, with that assumed sadness of the priest for whom death is a bread winner. He crossed himself and approaching with his professional gesture: \\\"Well, my poor children! I have come to help you pass these last sad hours.\\\" But Sister Eulalie suddenly arose. \\\"Thank you, \\\"father, but my brother and I prefer to remain alone with her. This is our last chance to see her, and we wish to be together, all three of us, as we--we--used to be when we were small and our poor mo--mother----\\\"\\nGrief and tears stopped her; she could not continue.\\nOnce more serene, the priest bowed, thinking of his bed. \\\"As you wish, my children.\\\" He kneeled, crossed himself, prayed, arose and went out quietly, murmuring: \\\"She was a saint!\\\"\\nThey remained alone, the dead woman and her children. The ticking of the clock, hidden in the shadow, could be heard distinctly, and through the open window drifted in the sweet smell of hay and of woods, together with the soft moonlight. No other noise could be heard over the land except the occasional croaking of the frog or the chirping of some belated insect. An infinite peace, a divine melancholy, a silent serenity surrounded this dead woman, seemed to be breathed out from her and to appease nature itself.\\nThen the judge, still kneeling, his head buried in the bed clothes, cried in a voice altered by grief and deadened by the sheets and blankets: \\\"Mamma, mamma, mamma!\\\" And his sister, frantically striking her forehead against the woodwork, convulsed, twitching and trembling as in an epileptic fit, moaned: \\\"Jesus, Jesus, mamma, Jesus!\\\" And both of them, shaken by a storm of grief, gasped and choked.\\nThe crisis slowly calmed down and they began to weep quietly, just as on the sea when a calm follows a squall.\\nA rather long time passed and they arose and looked at their dead. And the memories, those distant memories, yesterday so dear, to-day so torturing, came to their minds with all the little forgotten details, those little intimate familiar details which bring back to life the one who has left. They recalled to each other circumstances, words, smiles, intonations of the mother who was no longer to speak to them. They saw her again happy and calm. They remembered things which she had said, and a little motion of the hand, like beating time, which she often used when emphasizing something important.\\nAnd they loved her as they never had loved her before. They measured the depth of their grief, and thus they discovered how lonely they would find themselves.\\nIt was their prop, their guide, their whole youth, all the best part of their lives which was disappearing. It was their bond with life, their mother, their mamma, the connecting link with their forefathers which they would thenceforth miss. They now became solitary, lonely beings; they could no longer look back.\\nThe nun said to her brother: \\\"You remember how mamma used always to read her old letters; they are all there in that drawer. Let us, in turn, read them; let us live her whole life through tonight beside her! It would be like a road to the cross, like making the acquaintance of her mother, of our grandparents, whom we never knew, but whose letters are there and of whom she so often spoke, do you remember?\\\"\\nOut of the drawer they took about ten little packages of yellow paper, tied with care and arranged one beside the other. They threw these relics on the bed and chose one of them on which the word \\\"Father\\\" was written. They opened and read it.\\nIt was one of those old-fashioned letters which one finds in old family desk drawers, those epistles which smell of another century. The first one started: \\\"My dear,\\\" another one: \\\"My beautiful little girl,\\\" others: \\\"My dear child,\\\" or: \\\"My dear daughter.\\\" And suddenly the nun began to read aloud, to read over to the dead woman her whole history, all her tender memories. The judge, resting his elbow on the bed, was listening with his eyes fastened on his mother. The motionless body seemed happy.\\nSister Eulalie, interrupting herself, said suddenly:\\n\\\"These ought to be put in the grave with her; they ought to be used as a shroud and she ought to be buried in it.\\\" She took another package, on which no name was written. She began to read in a firm voice: \\\"My adored one, I love you wildly. Since yesterday I have been suffering the tortures of the damned, haunted by our memory. I feel your lips against mine, your eyes in mine, your breast against mine. I love you, I love you! You have driven me mad. My arms open, I gasp, moved by a wild desire to hold you again. My whole soul and body cries out for you, wants you. I have kept in my mouth the taste of your kisses--\\\"\\nThe judge had straightened himself up. The nun stopped reading. He snatched the letter from her and looked for the signature. There was none, but only under the words, \\\"The man who adores you,\\\" the name \\\"Henry.\\\" Their father's name was Rene. Therefore this was not from him. The son then quickly rummaged through the package of letters, took one out and read: \\\"I can no longer live without your caresses.\\\" Standing erect, severe as when sitting on the bench, he looked unmoved at the dead woman. The nun, straight as a statue, tears trembling in the corners of her eyes, was watching her brother, waiting. Then he crossed the room slowly, went to the window and stood there, gazing out into the dark night.\\nWhen he turned around again Sister Eulalie, her eyes dry now, was still standing near the bed, her head bent down.\\nHe stepped forward, quickly picked up the letters and threw them pell-mell back into the drawer. Then he closed the curtains of the bed.\\nWhen daylight made the candles on the table turn pale the son slowly left his armchair, and without looking again at the mother upon whom he had passed sentence, severing the tie that united her to son and daughter, he said slowly: \\\"Let us now retire, sister.\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The story centers around the death of an elderly woman, who is described as having led a blameless and peaceful life.

B. white\", \"story\": \"Everything he kept saying is something it isn't. And everybody is always somewhere else. Maybe it was the city, being in the city, that made him feel how queer everything was and that it was something else. Maybe he kept thinking it was the names of the things. The names were tex and frequently koid. Or they were flex and oid or they were duroid sand or flexsan duro, but everything was glass but not quite glass and the thing that you touched the surface, washable, crease-resistant was rubber, only it wasn't quite rubber and you didn't quite touch it but almost. The wall, which was glass but turned out on being approached not to be a wall, it was something else, it was an opening or doorway--and the doorway through which he saw himself approaching turned out to be something else, it was a wall. And what he had eaten not having agreed with him.\\nHe was in a washable house, but he wasn't sure. Now about those rats, he kept saying to himself. He meant the rats that the Professor had driven crazy by forcing them to deal with problems which were beyond the scope of rats, the insoluble problems. He meant the rats that had been trained to jump at the square card with the circle in the middle, and the card because it was something it wasn't would give way and let the rat into a place where the food was, but then one day it would be a trick played on the rat, and the card would be changed, and the rat would jump but the card wouldn't give way, and it was an impossible situation for a rat and the rat would go insane and into its eyes would come the unspeakably bright imploring look of the frustrated, and after the convulsions were over and the frantic racing around, then the passive stage would set in and the willingness to let anything be done to it, even if it was something else.\\nHe didn't know which door or wall or opening in the house to jump at, to get through, because one was an opening that wasn't a door it was a void, or kid and the other was a wall that wasn't an opening, it was a sanitary cupboard of the same color. He caught a glimpse of his eyes staring into his eyes, in the and in them was the expression he had seen in the picture of the rats--weary after convulsions and the frantic racing around, when they were willing and did not mind having anything done to them. More and more he kept saying I am confronted by a problem which is incapable of solution for this time even if he chose the right door, there would be no food behind it and that is what madness is, and things seeming different from what they are. He heard, in the house where he was, in the city to which he had gone as toward a door which might, or might not, give way, a noise--not a loud noise but more of a low prefabricated humming. It came from a place in the base of the wall or stat where the flue carrying the filterable air was, and not far from the Minipiano, which was made of the same material nailbrushes are made of, and which was under the stairs. \\\"This, too, has been tested,\\\" she said, pointing, but not at it, \\\"and found viable.\\\" It wasn't a loud noise, he kept thinking, sorry that he had seen his eyes, even though it was through his own eyes that he had seen them.\\nFirst will come the convulsions he said, then the exhaustion, then the willingness to let anything be done. \\\"And you better believe it will be.\\\"\\nAll his life he had been confronted by situations which were incapable of being solved, and there was a deliberateness behind all this, behind this changing of the card or door, because they would always wait until you had learned to jump at the certain card or door--the one with the circle--and then they would change it on you. There have been so many doors changed on me, he said, in the last twenty years, but it is now becoming clear that it is an impossible situation, and the question is whether to jump again, even though they ruffle you in the rump with a blast of air--to make you jump. He wished he wasn't standing by the Minipiano. First they would teach you the prayers and the Psalms, and that would be the right doorthe one with the circle and the long sweet words with the holy sound, and that would be the one to jump at to get where the food was. Then one day you jumped and it didn't give way, so that all you got was the bump on the nose, and the first bewilderment, the first young bewilderment.\\nI don't know whether to tell her about the door they substituted or not, he said, the one with the equation on it and the picture of the amoeba reproducing itself by division. Or the one with the photostatic copy of the check for thirty-two dollars and fifty cents. But the jumping was so long ago, although the bump is . . . how those old wounds hurt! Being crazy this way wouldn't be so bad if only, if only. If only when you put your foot forward to take a step, the ground wouldn't come up to meet your foot the way it does. And the same way in the street only I may never get back to the street unless I jump at the right door, the curb coming up to meet your foot, anticipating ever so delicately the weight of the body, which is somewhere else. \\\"We could take your name,\\\" she said, \\\"and send it to you.\\\" And it wouldn't be so bad if only you could read a sentence all the way through without jumping your eye to something else on the same page; and then he kept thinking there was that man out in Jersey, the one who started to chop his trees down, one by one, the man who began talking about how he would take his house to pieces, brick by brick, because he faced a problem incapable of solution, probably, so he began to hack at the trees in the yard, began to pluck with trembling fingers at the bricks in the house. Even if a house is not washable, it is worth taking down. It is not till later that the exhaustion sets in.\\nBut it is inevitable that they will keep changing the doors on you, he said, because that is what they are for; and the thing is to get used to it and not let it unsettle the mind. But that would mean not jumping, and you can't. Nobody can not jump. There will be no not-jumping. Among rats, perhaps, but among people never. Everybody has to keep jumping at a door the one with the circle on it because that is the way everybody is, especially some people. You wouldn't want me, standing here, to tell you, would you, about my friend the poet deceased who said, \\\"My heart has followed all my days something I cannot name\\\"? It had the circle on it. And like many poets, although few so beloved, he is gone. It killed him, the jumping. First, of course, there were the preliminary bouts, the convulsions, and the calm and the willingness.\\nI remember the door with the picture of the girl on it only it was spring, her arms outstretched in loveliness, her dress it was the one with the circle on it uncaught, beginning the slow, clear, blinding cascade-and I guess we would all like to try that door again, for it seemed like the way and for a while it was the way, the door would open and you would go through winged and exalted like any rat and the food would be there, the way the Professor had it arranged, everything O.K., and you had chosen the right door for the world was young. The time they changed that door on me, my nose bled for a hundred hours--how do you like that, Madam? Or would you prefer to show me further through this so strange house, or you could take my name and send it to me, for although my heart has followed all my days something I cannot name, I am tired of the jumping and I do not know which way to go, Madam, and I am not even sure that I am not tired beyond the endurance of man rat, if you will and have taken leave of sanity. What are you following these days, old friend, after your recovery from the last bump? What is the name, or is it something you cannot name? The rats have a name for it by this time, perhaps, but I don't know what they call it. I call it and it comes in sheets, something like insulating board, unattainable and ugli-proof.\\nAnd there was the man out in Jersey, because I keep thinking about his terrible necessity and the passion and trouble he had gone to all those years in the indescribable abundance of a householder's detail, building the estate and the planting of the trees and in spring the lawn-dressing and in fall the bulbs for the spring burgeoning, and the watering of the grass on the long light evenings in summer and the gravel for the driveway all had to be thought out, planned and the decorative borders, probably, the perennials and the bug spray, and the building of the house from plans of the architect, first the sills, then the studs, then the full corn in the ear, the floors laid on the floor timbers, smoothed, and then the carpets upon the smooth floors and the curtains and the rods therefor. And then, almost without warning, he would be jumping at the same old door and it wouldn't give: they had changed it on him, making life no longer supportable under the elms in the elm shade, under the maples in the maple shade.\\n\\\"Here you have the maximum of openness in a small room.\\\"\\nIt was impossible to say maybe it was the city what made him feel the way he did, and I am not the only one either, he kept thinking--ask any doctor if I am. The doctors, they know how many there are, they even know where the trouble is only they don't like to tell you about the prefrontal lobe because that means making a hole in your skull and removing the work of centuries. It took so long coming, this lobe, so many, many years. Is it something you read in the paper, perhaps? And now, the strain being so great, the door having been changed by the Professor once too often . . . but it only means a whiff of ether, a few deft strokes, and the higher animal becomes a little easier in his mind and more like the lower one. From now on, you see, that's the way it will be, the ones with the small prefrontal lobes will win because the other ones are hurt too much by this incessant bumping. They can stand just so much, em, Doctor? And what is that, pray, that you have in your hand? Still, you never can tell, em, Madam?\\nHe crossed carefully the room, the thick carpet under him softly, and went toward the door carefully, which was glass and he could see himself in it, and which, at his approach, opened to allow him to pass through; and beyond he half expected to find one of the old doors that he had known, perhaps the one with the circle, the one with the girl her arms outstretched in loveliness and beauty before him. But he saw instead a moving stairway, and descended in light he kept thinking to the street below and to the other people.

The waves followed each other close, rolling in as high as mountains, scattering the foam as they broke.\\nThe storm engulfed itself in the little valley of Yport, whistling and moaning, tearing the shingles from the roofs, smashing the shutters, knocking down the chimneys, rushing through the narrow streets in such gusts that one could walk only by holding on to the walls, and children would have been lifted up like leaves and carried over the houses into the fields.\\nThe fishing smacks had been hauled high up on land, because at high tide the sea would sweep the beach. Several sailors, sheltered behind the curved bottoms of their boats, were watching this battle of the sky and the sea.\\nThen, one by one, they went away, for night was falling on the storm, wrapping in shadows the raging ocean and all the battling elements.\\nJust two men remained, their hands plunged deep into their pockets, bending their backs beneath the squall, their woolen caps pulled down over their ears; two big Normandy fishermen, bearded, their skin tanned through exposure, with the piercing black eyes of the sailor who looks over the horizon like a bird of prey.\\nOne of them was saying:\\n\\\"Come on, Jeremie, let's go play dominoes. It's my treat.\\\"\\nThe other hesitated a while, tempted on one hand by the game and the thought of brandy, knowing well that, if he went to Paumelle's, he would return home drunk; held back, on the other hand, by the idea of his wife remaining alone in the house.\\nHe asked:\\n\\\"Any one might think that you had made a bet to get me drunk every night. Say, what good is it doing you, since it's always you that's treating?\\\"\\nNevertheless he was smiling at the idea of all this brandy drunk at the expense of another. He was smiling the contented smirk of an avaricious Norman.\\nMathurin, his friend, kept pulling him by the sleeve.\\n\\\"Come on, Jeremie. This isn't the kind of a night to go home without anything to warm you up. What are you afraid of? Isn't your wife going to warm your bed for you?\\\"\\nJeremie answered:\\n\\\"The other night I couldn't find the door--I had to be fished out of the ditch in front of the house!\\\"\\nHe was still laughing at this drunkard's recollection, and he was unconsciously going toward Paumelle's Caf\\u00e9, where a light was shining in the window; he was going, pulled by Mathurin and pushed by the wind, unable to resist these combined forces.\\nThe low room was full of sailors, smoke and noise. All these men, clad in woolens, their elbows on the tables, were shouting to make themselves heard. The more people came in, the more one had to shout in order to overcome the noise of voices and the rattling of dominoes on the marble tables.\\nJeremie and Mathurin sat down in a corner and began a game, and the glasses were emptied in rapid succession into their thirsty throats.\\nThen they played more games and drank more glasses. Mathurin kept pouring and winking to the saloon keeper, a big, red-faced man, who chuckled as though at the thought of some fine joke; and Jeremie kept absorbing alcohol and wagging his head, giving vent to a roar of laughter and looking at his comrade with a stupid and contented expression.\\nAll the customers were going away. Every time that one of them would open the door to leave a gust of wind would blow into the caf\\u00e9, making the tobacco smoke swirl around, swinging the lamps at the end of their chains and making their flames flicker, and suddenly one could hear the deep booming of a breaking wave and the moaning of the wind.\\nJeremie, his collar unbuttoned, was taking drunkard's poses, one leg outstretched, one arm hanging down and in the other hand holding a domino.\\nThey were alone now with the owner, who had come up to them, interested.\\nHe asked:\\n\\\"Well, Jeremie, how goes it inside? Feel less thirsty after wetting your throat?\\\"\\nJeremie muttered:\\n\\\"The more I wet it, the drier it gets inside.\\\"\\nThe innkeeper cast a sly glance at Mathurin. He said:\\n\\\"And your brother, Mathurin, where's he now?\\\"\\nThe sailor laughed silently:\\n\\\"Don't worry; he's warm, all right.\\\"\\nAnd both of them looked toward Jeremie, who was triumphantly putting down the double six and announcing:\\n\\\"Game!\\\"\\nThen the owner declared:\\n\\\"Well, boys, I'm goin' to bed. I will leave you the lamp and the bottle; there's twenty cents' worth in it. Lock the door when you go, Mathurin, and slip the key under the mat the way you did the other night.\\\"\\nMathurin answered:\\n\\\"Don't worry; it'll be all right.\\\"\\nPaumelle shook hands with his two customers and slowly went up the wooden stairs. For several minutes his heavy step echoed through the little house. Then a loud creaking announced that he had got into bed.\\nThe two men continued to play. From time to time a more violent gust of wind would shake the whole house, and the two drinkers would look up, as though some one were about to enter. Then Mathurin would take the bottle and fill Jeremie's glass. But suddenly the clock over the bar struck twelve. Its hoarse clang sounded like the rattling of saucepans. Then Mathurin got up like a sailor whose watch is over.\\n\\\"Come on, Jeremie, we've got to get out.\\\"\\nThe other man rose to his feet with difficulty, got his balance by leaning on the table, reached the door and opened it while his companion was putting out the light.\\nAs soon as they were in the street Mathurin locked the door and then said:\\n\\\"Well, so long. See you to-morrow night!\\\"\\nAnd he disappeared in the darkness.\\nJeremie took a few steps, staggered, stretched out his hands, met a wall which supported him and began to stumble along. From time to time a gust of wind would sweep through the street, pushing him forward, making him run for a few steps; then, when the wind would die down, he would stop short, having lost his impetus, and once more he would begin to stagger on his unsteady drunkard's legs.\\nHe went instinctively toward his home, just as birds go to their nests. Finally he recognized his door, and began to feel about for the keyhole and tried to put the key in it. Not finding the hole, he began to swear. Then he began to beat on the door with his fists, calling for his wife to come and help him:\\n\\\"Melina! Oh, Melina!\\\"\\nAs he leaned against the door for support, it gave way and opened, and Jeremie, losing his prop, fell inside, rolling on his face into the middle of his room, and he felt something heavy pass over him and escape in the night.\\nHe was no longer moving, dazed by fright, bewildered, fearing the devil, ghosts, all the mysterious beings of darkness, and he waited a long time without daring to move. But when he found out that nothing else was moving, a little reason returned to him, the reason of a drunkard.\\nGently he sat up. Again he waited a long time, and at last, growing bolder, he called:\\n\\\"Melina!\\\"\\nHis wife did not answer.\\nThen, suddenly, a suspicion crossed his darkened mind, an indistinct, vague suspicion. He was not moving; he was sitting there in the dark, trying to gather together his scattered wits, his mind stumbling over incomplete ideas, just as his feet stumbled along.\\nOnce more he asked:\\n\\\"Who was it, Melina? Tell me who it was. I won't hurt you!\\\"\\nHe waited, no voice was raised in the darkness. He was now reasoning with himself out loud.\\n\\\"I'm drunk, all right! I'm drunk! And he filled me up, the dog; he did it, to stop my goin' home. I'm drunk!\\\"\\nAnd he would continue:\\n\\\"Tell me who it was, Melina, or somethin'll happen to you.\\\"\\nAfter having waited again, he went on with the slow and obstinate logic of a drunkard:\\n\\\"He's been keeping me at that loafer Paumelle's place every night, so as to stop my going home. It's some trick. Oh, you damned carrion!\\\"\\nSlowly he got on his knees. A blind fury was gaining possession of him, mingling with the fumes of alcohol.\\nHe continued:\\n\\\"Tell me who it was, Melina, or you'll get a licking--I warn you!\\\"\\nHe was now standing, trembling with a wild fury, as though the alcohol had set his blood on fire. He took a step, knocked against a chair, seized it, went on, reached the bed, ran his hands over it and felt the warm body of his wife.\\nThen, maddened, he roared:\\n\\\"So! You were there, you piece of dirt, and you wouldn't answer!\\\"\\nAnd, lifting the chair, which he was holding in his strong sailor's grip, he swung it down before him with an exasperated fury. A cry burst from the bed, an agonizing, piercing cry. Then he began to thrash around like a thresher in a barn. And soon nothing more moved. The chair was broken to pieces, but he still held one leg and beat away with it, panting.\\nAt last he stopped to ask:\\n\\\"Well, are you ready to tell me who it was?\\\"\\nMelina did not answer.\\nThen tired out, stupefied from his exertion, he stretched himself out on the ground and slept.\\nWhen day came a neighbor, seeing the door open, entered.

At one time he was my most intimate friend, the friend who knows one's thoughts, with whom one passes long, quiet, happy evenings, to whom one tells one's secret love affairs, and who seems to draw out those rare, ingenious, delicate thoughts born of that sympathy that gives a sense of repose.\\nFor years we had scarcely been separated; we had lived, travelled, thought and dreamed together; had liked the same things, had admired the same books, understood the same authors, trembled with the same sensations, and very often laughed at the same individuals, whom we understood completely by merely exchanging a glance.\\nThen he married. He married, quite suddenly, a little girl from the provinces, who had come to Paris in search of a husband. How in the world could that little thin, insipidly fair girl, with her weak hands, her light, vacant eyes, and her clear, silly voice, who was exactly like a hundred thousand marriageable dolls, have picked up that intelligent, clever young fellow? Can any one understand these things? No doubt he had hoped for happiness, simple, quiet and long-enduring happiness, in the arms of a good, tender and faithful woman; he had seen all that in the transparent looks of that schoolgirl with light hair.\\nHe had not dreamed of the fact that an active, living and vibrating man grows weary of everything as soon as he understands the stupid reality, unless, indeed, he becomes so brutalized that he understands nothing whatever.\\nWhat would he be like when I met him again? Still lively, witty, light- hearted and enthusiastic, or in a state of mental torpor induced by provincial life? A man may change greatly in the course of fifteen years!\\nThe train stopped at a small station, and as I got out of the carriage, a stout, a very stout man with red cheeks and a big stomach rushed up to me with open arms, exclaiming: \\\"George!\\\" I embraced him, but I had not recognized him, and then I said, in astonishment: \\\"By Jove! You have not grown thin!\\\" And he replied with a laugh:\\n\\\"What did you expect? Good living, a good table and good nights! Eating and sleeping, that is my existence!\\\"\\nI looked at him closely, trying to discover in that broad face the features I held so dear. His eyes alone had not changed, but I no longer saw the same expression in them, and I said to myself: \\\"If the expression be the reflection of the mind, the thoughts in that head are not what they used to be formerly; those thoughts which I knew so well.\\\"\\nYet his eyes were bright, full of happiness and friendship, but they had not that clear, intelligent expression which shows as much as words the brightness of the intellect. Suddenly he said:\\n\\\"Here are my two eldest children.\\\" A girl of fourteen, who was almost a woman, and a boy of thirteen, in the dress of a boy from a Lycee, came forward in a hesitating and awkward manner, and I said in a low voice: \\\"Are they yours?\\\" \\\"Of course they are,\\\" he replied, laughing. \\\"How many have you?\\\" \\\"Five! There are three more at home.\\\"\\nHe said this in a proud, self-satisfied, almost triumphant manner, and I felt profound pity, mingled with a feeling of vague contempt, for this vainglorious and simple reproducer of his species.\\nI got into a carriage which he drove himself, and we set off through the town, a dull, sleepy, gloomy town where nothing was moving in the streets except a few dogs and two or three maidservants. Here and there a shopkeeper, standing at his door, took off his hat, and Simon returned his salute and told me the man's name; no doubt to show me that he knew all the inhabitants personally, and the thought struck me that he was thinking of becoming a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies, that dream of all those who bury themselves in the provinces.\\nWe were soon out of the town, and the carriage turned into a garden that was an imitation of a park, and stopped in front of a turreted house, which tried to look like a chateau.\\n\\\"That is my den,\\\" said Simon, so that I might compliment him on it. \\\"It is charming,\\\" I replied.\\nA lady appeared on the steps, dressed for company, and with company phrases all ready prepared. She was no longer the light-haired, insipid girl I had seen in church fifteen years previously, but a stout lady in curls and flounces, one of those ladies of uncertain age, without intellect, without any of those things that go to make a woman. In short, she was a mother, a stout, commonplace mother, a human breeding machine which procreates without any other preoccupation but her children and her cook-book.\\nShe welcomed me, and I went into the hall, where three children, ranged according to their height, seemed set out for review, like firemen before a mayor, and I said: \\\"Ah! ah! so there are the others?\\\" Simon, radiant with pleasure, introduced them: \\\"Jean, Sophie and Gontran.\\\"\\nThe door of the drawing-room was open. I went in, and in the depths of an easy-chair, I saw something trembling, a man, an old, paralyzed man. Madame Radevin came forward and said: \\\"This is my grandfather, monsieur; he is eighty-seven.\\\" And then she shouted into the shaking old man's ears: \\\"This is a friend of Simon's, papa.\\\" The old gentleman tried to say \\\"good-day\\\" to me, and he muttered: \\\"Oua, oua, oua,\\\" and waved his hand, and I took a seat saying: \\\"You are very kind, monsieur.\\\"\\nSimon had just come in, and he said with a laugh: \\\"So! You have made grandpapa's acquaintance. He is a treasure, that old man; he is the delight of the children. But he is so greedy that he almost kills himself at every meal; you have no idea what he would eat if he were allowed to do as he pleased. But you will see, you will see. He looks at all the sweets as if they were so many girls. You never saw anything so funny; you will see presently.\\\"\\nI was then shown to my room, to change my dress for dinner, and hearing a great clatter behind me on the stairs, I turned round and saw that all the children were following me behind their father; to do me honor, no doubt.\\nMy windows looked out across a dreary, interminable plain, an ocean of grass, of wheat and of oats, without a clump of trees or any rising ground, a striking and melancholy picture of the life which they must be leading in that house.\\nA bell rang; it was for dinner, and I went downstairs. Madame Radevin took my arm in a ceremonious manner, and we passed into the dining-room. A footman wheeled in the old man in his armchair. He gave a greedy and curious look at the dessert, as he turned his shaking head with difficulty from one dish to the other.\\nSimon rubbed his hands: \\\"You will be amused,\\\" he said; and all the children understanding that I was going to be indulged with the sight of their greedy grandfather, began to laugh, while their mother merely smiled and shrugged her shoulders, and Simon, making a speaking trumpet of his hands, shouted at the old man: \\\"This evening there is sweet creamed rice!\\\" The wrinkled face of the grandfather brightened, and he trembled more violently, from head to foot, showing that he had understood and was very pleased. The dinner began.\\n\\\"Just look!\\\" Simon whispered. The old man did not like the soup, and refused to eat it; but he was obliged to do it for the good of his health, and the footman forced the spoon into his mouth, while the old man blew so energetically, so as not to swallow the soup, that it was scattered like a spray all over the table and over his neighbors. The children writhed with laughter at the spectacle, while their father, who was also amused, said: \\\"Is not the old man comical?\\\"\\nDuring the whole meal they were taken up solely with him. He devoured the dishes on the table with his eyes, and tried to seize them and pull them over to him with his trembling hands. They put them almost within his reach, to see his useless efforts, his trembling clutches at them, the piteous appeal of his whole nature, of his eyes, of his mouth and of his nose as he smelt them, and he slobbered on his table napkin with eagerness, while uttering inarticulate grunts. And the whole family was highly amused at this horrible and grotesque scene.\\nThen they put a tiny morsel on his plate, and he ate with feverish gluttony, in order to get something more as soon as possible, and when the sweetened rice was brought in, he nearly had a fit, and groaned with greediness, and Gontran called out to him:\\n\\\"You have eaten too much already; you can have no more.\\\" And they pretended not to give him any. Then he began to cry; he cried and trembled more violently than ever, while all the children laughed. At last, however, they gave him his helping, a very small piece; and as he ate the first mouthful, he made a comical noise in his throat, and a movement with his neck as ducks do when they swallow too large a morsel, and when he had swallowed it, he began to stamp his feet, so as to get more.\\nI was seized with pity for this saddening and ridiculous Tantalus, and interposed on his behalf:\\n\\\"Come, give him a little more rice!\\\" But Simon replied: \\\"Oh! no, my dear fellow, if he were to eat too much, it would harm him, at his age.\\\"\\nI held my tongue, and thought over those words. Oh, ethics! Oh, logic! Oh, wisdom! At his age! So they deprived him of his only remaining pleasure out of regard for his health! His health! What would he do with it, inert and trembling wreck that he was? They were taking care of his life, so they said. His life? How many days? Ten, twenty, fifty, or a hundred? Why? For his own sake? Or to preserve for some time longer the spectacle of his impotent greediness in the family.\\nThere was nothing left for him to do in this life, nothing whatever. He had one single wish left, one sole pleasure; why not grant him that last solace until he died?\\nAfter we had played cards for a long time, I went up to my room and to bed; I was low-spirited and sad, sad, sad! and I sat at my window. Not a sound could be heard outside but the beautiful warbling of a bird in a tree, somewhere in the distance. No doubt the bird was singing in a low voice during the night, to lull his mate, who was asleep on her eggs. And I thought of my poor friend's five children, and pictured him to myself, snoring by the side of his ugly wife.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"The narrator goes to visit their old friend, Simon Radevin, whom they haven't seen in fifteen years.

The narrator is frustrated by the family's logic and questions the purpose of prolonging the grandfather's life if all he has left is the pleasure of food.\\n\\nAfter playing cards, the narrator goes to their room feeling sad and sits by the window thinking about Simon's five children and imagining Simon snoring next to his unattractive wife.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14\": \"The protagonist goes to visit his old friend, Simon Radevin, whom he hasn't seen in fifteen years. Simon was previously the protagonist's closest friend, with whom he had shared many intimate and intellectual experiences. However, during their separation, Simon married a younger girl from the provinces, and the protagonist is curious to see how this marriage has changed his friend.\\n\\nWhen the protagonist finally sees Simon at the train station, he is shocked to find a man who has grown incredibly overweight and seemingly dull. Simon admits that his life consists of indulgence in good food and sleep. The protagonist also meets Simon's children, whom he takes great pride in introducing. The protagonist finds it difficult to hide his pity and contempt for his friend, who seems content with a simple life of raising children and indulging his own desires.\\n\\nThe protagonist is then taken to Simon's grand turreted house, one that Simon obviously wants to showcase. He is introduced to Simon's wife, who has also changed with time. She has become a typical mother figure, focused solely on organizing their household and taking care of the children. The protagonist discerns no intellectual capabilities or uniqueness. He is then introduced to Simon's paralyzed grandfather.\\n\\nAt dinner, the protagonist witnesses a blind obsession with indulgence when the family insensitively tries to amuse themselves with the generous yet aged man who lost control over life. The grandfather, shaking violently from tremors and advanced age, lusts after the sweet desserts on the table. Simon and his children tease the feeble-minded old man, pretending not to give in to his desires until he cries and stamps his feet like a toddler. The protagonist feels pity and interjects, advocating for the old man to be given the pleasure he seeks, but Simon dismisses it as not being beneficial for his grandfather's health. This interaction leaves the protagonist feeling dejected and sad.\\n\\nAs the night falls, the protagonist looks out the window and reflects on the emptiness and simple pleasures that have consumed his friend's life. He contrasts the vibrant sound of a bird's singing to the silence of Simon snoring beside his less attractive wife.

Through the caf\\u00e9 windows they could see the Boulevard, crowded with people. They could feel the gentle breezes which are wafted over Paris on warm summer evenings and make you feel like going out somewhere, you care not where, under the trees, and make you dream of moonlit rivers, of fireflies and of larks.\\nOne of the two, Henri Simon, heaved a deep sigh and said:\\n\\\"Ah! I am growing old. It's sad. Formerly, on evenings like this, I felt full of life. Now, I only feel regrets. Life is short!\\\"\\nHe was perhaps forty-five years old, very bald and already growing stout.\\nThe other, Pierre Carnier, a trifle older, but thin and lively, answered:\\n\\\"Well, my boy, I have grown old without noticing it in the least. I have always been merry, healthy, vigorous and all the rest. As one sees oneself in the mirror every day, one does not realize the work of age, for it is slow, regular, and it modifies the countenance so gently that the changes are unnoticeable. It is for this reason alone that we do not die of sorrow after two or three years of excitement. For we cannot understand the alterations which time produces. In order to appreciate them one would have to remain six months without seeing one's own face-- then, oh, what a shock!\\n\\\"And the women, my friend, how I pity the poor beings! All their joy, all their power, all their life, lies in their beauty, which lasts ten years.\\n\\\"As I said, I aged without noticing it; I thought myself practically a youth, when I was almost fifty years old. Not feeling the slightest infirmity, I went about, happy and peaceful.\\n\\\"The revelation of my decline came to me in a simple and terrible manner, which overwhelmed me for almost six months--then I became resigned.\\n\\\"Like all men, I have often been in love, but most especially once.\\n\\\"I met her at the seashore, at Etretat, about twelve years ago, shortly after the war. There is nothing prettier than this beach during the morning bathing hour. It is small, shaped like a horseshoe, framed by high while cliffs, which are pierced by strange holes called the 'Portes,' one stretching out into the ocean like the leg of a giant, the other short and dumpy. The women gather on the narrow strip of sand in this frame of high rocks, which they make into a gorgeous garden of beautiful gowns. The sun beats down on the shores, on the multicolored parasols, on the blue-green sea; and all is gay, delightful, smiling. You sit down at the edge of the water and you watch the bathers. The women come down, wrapped in long bath robes, which they throw off daintily when they reach the foamy edge of the rippling waves; and they run into the water with a rapid little step, stopping from time to time for a delightful little thrill from the cold water, a short gasp.\\n\\\"Very few stand the test of the bath. It is there that they can be judged, from the ankle to the throat. Especially on leaving the water are the defects revealed, although water is a powerful aid to flabby skin.\\n\\\"The first time that I saw this young woman in the water, I was delighted, entranced. She stood the test well. There are faces whose charms appeal to you at first glance and delight you instantly. You seem to have found the woman whom you were born to love. I had that feeling and that shock.\\n\\\"I was introduced, and was soon smitten worse than I had ever been before. My heart longed for her. It is a terrible yet delightful thing thus to be dominated by a young woman. It is almost torture, and yet infinite delight. Her look, her smile, her hair fluttering in the wind, the little lines of her face, the slightest movement of her features, delighted me, upset me, entranced me. She had captured me, body and soul, by her gestures, her manners, even by her clothes, which seemed to take on a peculiar charm as soon as she wore them. I grew tender at the sight of her veil on some piece of furniture, her gloves thrown on a chair. Her gowns seemed to me inimitable. Nobody had hats like hers.\\n\\\"She was married, but her husband came only on Saturday, and left on Monday. I didn't concern myself about him, anyhow. I wasn't jealous of him, I don't know why; never did a creature seem to me to be of less importance in life, to attract my attention less than this man.\\n\\\"But she! how I loved her! How beautiful, graceful and young she was! She was youth, elegance, freshness itself! Never before had I felt so strongly what a pretty, distinguished, delicate, charming, graceful being woman is. Never before had I appreciated the seductive beauty to be found in the curve of a cheek, the movement of a lip, the pinkness of an ear, the shape of that foolish organ called the nose.\\n\\\"This lasted three months; then I left for America, overwhelmed with sadness. But her memory remained in me, persistent, triumphant. From far away I was as much hers as I had been when she was near me. Years passed by, and I did not forget her. The charming image of her person was ever before my eyes and in my heart. And my love remained true to her, a quiet tenderness now, something like the beloved memory of the most beautiful and the most enchanting thing I had ever met in my life.\\n\\\"Twelve years are not much in a lifetime! One does not feel them slip by. The years follow each other gently and quickly, slowly yet rapidly, each one is long and yet so soon over! They add up so rapidly, they leave so few traces behind them, they disappear so completely, that, when one turns round to look back over bygone years, one sees nothing and yet one does not understand how one happens to be so old. It seemed to me, really, that hardly a few months separated me from that charming season on the sands of Etretat.\\n\\\"Last spring I went to dine with some friends at Maisons-Laffitte.\\n\\\"Just as the train was leaving, a big, fat lady, escorted by four little girls, got into my car. I hardly looked at this mother hen, very big, very round, with a face as full as the moon framed in an enormous, beribboned hat.\\n\\\"She was puffing, out of breath from having been forced to walk quickly. The children began to chatter. I unfolded my paper and began to read.\\n\\\"We had just passed Asnieres, when my neighbor suddenly turned to me and said:\\n\\\"'Excuse me, sir, but are you not Monsieur Garnier?'\\n\\\"'Yes, madame.'\\n\\\"Then she began to laugh, the pleased laugh of a good woman; and yet it was sad.\\n\\\"'You do not seem to recognize me.'\\n\\\"I hesitated. It seemed to me that I had seen that face somewhere; but where? when? I answered:\\n\\\"'Yes--and no. I certainly know you, and yet I cannot recall your name.'\\n\\\"She blushed a little:\\n\\\"'Madame Julie Lefevre.'\\n\\\"Never had I received such a shock. In a second it seemed to me as though it were all over with me! I felt that a veil had been torn from my eyes and that I was going to make a horrible and heartrending discovery.\\n\\\"So that was she! That big, fat, common woman, she! She had become the mother of these four girls since I had last seen her. And these little beings surprised me as much as their mother. They were part of her; they were big girls, and already had a place in life. Whereas she no longer counted, she, that marvel of dainty and charming gracefulness. It seemed to me that I had seen her but yesterday, and this is how I found her again! Was it possible? A poignant grief seized my heart; and also a revolt against nature herself, an unreasoning indignation against this brutal, injurious act of destruction.\\n\\\"I looked at her, bewildered. Then I took her hand in mine, and tears came to my eyes. I wept for her lost youth. For I did not know this fat lady.\\n\\\"She was also excited, and stammered:\\n\\\"'I am greatly changed, am I not? What can you expect--everything has its time! You see, I have become a mother, nothing but a good mother. Farewell to the rest, that is over. Oh! I never expected you to recognize me if we met. You, too, have changed. It took me quite a while to be sure that I was not mistaken. Your hair is all white. Just think! Twelve years ago! Twelve years! My oldest girl is already ten.'\\n\\\"I looked at the child. And I recognized in her something of her mother's old charm, but something as yet unformed, something which promised for the future. And life seemed to me as swift as a passing train.\\n\\\"We had reached Maisons-Laffitte. I kissed my old friend's hand. I had found nothing to utter but the most commonplace remarks. I was too much upset to talk.\\n\\\"At night, alone, at home, I stood in front of the mirror for a long time, a very long time. And I finally remembered what I had been, finally saw in my mind's eye my brown mustache, my black hair and the youthful expression of my face. Now I was old.

Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one\\u2019s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.\\n\\nThere was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.\\n\\nWhile the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.\\n\\nIn the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name \\u201cMr. James Dillingham Young.\\u201d\\n\\nThe \\u201cDillingham\\u201d had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called \\u201cJim\\u201d and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.\\n\\nDella finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn\\u2019t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling\\u2014something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.\\n\\nThere was a pier glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.\\n\\nSuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.\\n\\nNow, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim\\u2019s gold watch that had been his father\\u2019s and his grandfather\\u2019s. The other was Della\\u2019s hair. Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty\\u2019s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.\\n\\nSo now Della\\u2019s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.\\n\\nOn went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.\\n\\nWhere she stopped the sign read: \\u201cMme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds.\\u201d One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the \\u201cSofronie.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWill you buy my hair?\\u201d asked Della.\\n\\n\\u201cI buy hair,\\u201d said Madame. \\u201cTake yer hat off and let\\u2019s have a sight at the looks of it.\\u201d\\n\\nDown rippled the brown cascade.\\n\\n\\u201cTwenty dollars,\\u201d said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.\\n\\n\\u201cGive it to me quick,\\u201d said Della.\\n\\nOh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim\\u2019s present.\\n\\nShe found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation\\u2014as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim\\u2019s. It was like him. Quietness and value\\u2014the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.\\n\\nWhen Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends\\u2014a mammoth task.\\n\\nWithin forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.\\n\\n\\u201cIf Jim doesn\\u2019t kill me,\\u201d she said to herself, \\u201cbefore he takes a second look at me, he\\u2019ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do\\u2014oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?\\u201d\\n\\nAt 7 o\\u2019clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.\\n\\nJim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: \\u201cPlease God, make him think I am still pretty.\\u201d\\n\\nThe door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two\\u2014and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.\\n\\nJim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.\\n\\nDella wriggled off the table and went for him.\\n\\n\\u201cJim, darling,\\u201d she cried, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold because I couldn\\u2019t have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It\\u2019ll grow out again\\u2014you won\\u2019t mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say \\u2018Merry Christmas!\\u2019 Jim, and let\\u2019s be happy. You don\\u2019t know what a nice\\u2014what a beautiful, nice gift I\\u2019ve got for you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019ve cut off your hair?\\u201d asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.\\n\\n\\u201cCut it off and sold it,\\u201d said Della. \\u201cDon\\u2019t you like me just as well, anyhow? I\\u2019m me without my hair, ain\\u2019t I?\\u201d\\n\\nJim looked about the room curiously.\\n\\n\\u201cYou say your hair is gone?\\u201d he said, with an air almost of idiocy.\\n\\n\\u201cYou needn\\u2019t look for it,\\u201d said Della. \\u201cIt\\u2019s sold, I tell you\\u2014sold and gone, too. It\\u2019s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,\\u201d she went on with sudden serious sweetness, \\u201cbut nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?\\u201d\\n\\nOut of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year\\u2014what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.\\n\\nJim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t make any mistake, Dell,\\u201d he said, \\u201cabout me. I don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you\\u2019ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first.\\u201d\\n\\nWhite fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.\\n\\nFor there lay The Combs\\u2014the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rims\\u2014just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.\\n\\nBut she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: \\u201cMy hair grows so fast, Jim!\\u201d\\n\\nAnd then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, \\u201cOh, oh!\\u201d\\n\\nJim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.\\n\\n\\u201cIsn\\u2019t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You\\u2019ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it.\\u201d\\n\\nInstead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.\\n\\n\\u201cDell,\\u201d said he, \\u201clet\\u2019s put our Christmas presents away and keep \\u2019em a while. They\\u2019re too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.\\u201d\\n\\nThe magi, as you know, were wise men\\u2014wonderfully wise men\\u2014who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house.

What did I want to find?\\\" My hands were empty. \\\"Perhaps its upstairs then?\\\" The apples were in the loft.

Oh, was that the buried treasure?\\nA moment later the light had faded. Out in the garden then? But the trees spun darkness for a wandering beam of sun. So fine, so rare, coolly sunk beneath the surface the beam I sought always burned behind the glass. Death was the glass; death was between us, coming to the woman first, hundreds of years ago, leaving the house, sealing all the windows; the rooms were darkened. He left it, left her, went North, went East, saw the stars turned in the Southern sky; sought the house, found it dropped beneath the Downs. \\\"Safe, safe, safe,\\\" the pulse of the house beat gladly. 'The Treasure yours.\\\"\\nThe wind roars up the avenue. Trees stoop and bend this way and that. Moonbeams splash and spill wildly in the rain.

His hands shield the lantern. \\\"Look,\\\" he breathes. \\\"Sound asleep. Love upon their lips.\\\"\\nStooping, holding their silver lamp above us, long they look and deeply. Long they pause. The wind drives straightly; the flame stoops slightly. Wild beams of moonlight cross both floor and wall, and, meeting, stain the faces bent; the faces pondering; the faces that search the sleepers and seek their hidden joy.\\n\\\"Safe, safe, safe,\\\" the heart of the house beats proudly. \\\"Long years--\\\" he sighs. \\\"Again you found me.\\\" \\\"Here,\\\" she murmurs, \\\"sleeping; in the garden reading; laughing, rolling apples in the loft.

And immediately, as though in mockery of his scepticism, no further than the second line from the top, his eye was caught by the figure 9,499! Unable to believe his eyes, he hurriedly dropped the paper on his knees without looking to see the number of the ticket, and, just as though some one had given him a douche of cold water, he felt an agreeable chill in the pit of the stomach; tingling and terrible and sweet!\\n\\\"Masha, 9,499 is there!\\\" he said in a hollow voice.\\nHis wife looked at his astonished and panicstricken face, and realized that he was not joking.\\n\\\"9,499?\\\" she asked, turning pale and dropping the folded tablecloth on the table.\\n\\\"Yes, yes . . . it really is there!\\\"\\n\\\"And the number of the ticket?\\\"\\n\\\"Oh yes! There's the number of the ticket too. But stay . . . wait! No, I say! Anyway, the number of our series is there! Anyway, you understand....\\\"\\nLooking at his wife, Ivan Dmitritch gave a broad, senseless smile, like a baby when a bright object is shown it. His wife smiled too; it was as pleasant to her as to him that he only mentioned the series, and did not try to find out the number of the winning ticket. To torment and tantalize oneself with hopes of possible fortune is so sweet, so thrilling!\\n\\\"It is our series,\\\" said Ivan Dmitritch, after a long silence. \\\"So there is a probability that we have won. It's only a probability, but there it is!\\\"\\n\\\"Well, now look!\\\"\\n\\\"Wait a little. We have plenty of time to be disappointed. It's on the second line from the top, so the prize is seventy-five thousand. That's not money, but power, capital! And in a minute I shall look at the list, and there--26! Eh? I say, what if we really have won?\\\"\\nThe husband and wife began laughing and staring at one another in silence. The possibility of winning bewildered them; they could not have said, could not have dreamed, what they both needed that seventy-five thousand for, what they would buy, where they would go. They thought only of the figures 9,499 and 75,000 and pictured them in their imagination, while somehow they could not think of the happiness itself which was so possible.\\nIvan Dmitritch, holding the paper in his hand, walked several times from corner to corner, and only when he had recovered from the first impression began dreaming a little.\\n\\\"And if we have won,\\\" he said--\\\"why, it will be a new life, it will be a transformation! The ticket is yours, but if it were mine I should, first of all, of course, spend twenty-five thousand on real property in the shape of an estate; ten thousand on immediate expenses, new furnishing . . . travelling . . . paying debts, and so on. . . . The other forty thousand I would put in the bank and get interest on it.\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, an estate, that would be nice,\\\" said his wife, sitting down and dropping her hands in her lap.\\n\\\"Somewhere in the Tula or Oryol provinces. . . . In the first place we shouldn't need a summer villa, and besides, it would always bring in an income.\\\"\\nAnd pictures came crowding on his imagination, each more gracious and poetical than the last. And in all these pictures he saw himself well-fed, serene, healthy, felt warm, even hot! Here, after eating a summer soup, cold as ice, he lay on his back on the burning sand close to a stream or in the garden under a lime-tree. . . . It is hot. . . . His little boy and girl are crawling about near him, digging in the sand or catching ladybirds in the grass. He dozes sweetly, thinking of nothing, and feeling all over that he need not go to the office today, tomorrow, or the day after. Or, tired of lying still, he goes to the hayfield, or to the forest for mushrooms, or watches the peasants catching fish with a net. When the sun sets he takes a towel and soap and saunters to the bathing shed, where he undresses at his leisure, slowly rubs his bare chest with his hands, and goes into the water. And in the water, near the opaque soapy circles, little fish flit to and fro and green water-weeds nod their heads. After bathing there is tea with cream and milk rolls. . . . In the evening a walk or vint with the neighbors.\\n\\\"Yes, it would be nice to buy an estate,\\\" said his wife, also dreaming, and from her face it was evident that she was enchanted by her thoughts.\\nIvan Dmitritch pictured to himself autumn with its rains, its cold evenings, and its St. Martin's summer. At that season he would have to take longer walks about the garden and beside the river, so as to get thoroughly chilled, and then drink a big glass of vodka and eat a salted mushroom or a soused cucumber, and then--drink another. . . . The children would come running from the kitchen-garden, bringing a carrot and a radish smelling of fresh earth. . . . And then, he would lie stretched full length on the sofa, and in leisurely fashion turn over the pages of some illustrated magazine, or, covering his face with it and unbuttoning his waistcoat, give himself up to slumber.\\nThe St. Martin's summer is followed by cloudy, gloomy weather. It rains day and night, the bare trees weep, the wind is damp and cold. The dogs, the horses, the fowls--all are wet, depressed, downcast. There is nowhere to walk; one can't go out for days together; one has to pace up and down the room, looking despondently at the grey window. It is dreary!\\nIvan Dmitritch stopped and looked at his wife.\\n\\\"I should go abroad, you know, Masha,\\\" he said.\\nAnd he began thinking how nice it would be in late autumn to go abroad somewhere to the South of France ... to Italy ... to India!\\n\\\"I should certainly go abroad too,\\\" his wife said. \\\"But look at the number of the ticket!\\\"\\n\\\"Wait, wait! ...\\\"\\nHe walked about the room and went on thinking. It occurred to him: what if his wife really did go abroad? It is pleasant to travel alone, or in the society of light, careless women who live in the present, and not such as think and talk all the journey about nothing but their children, sigh, and tremble with dismay over every farthing. Ivan Dmitritch imagined his wife in the train with a multitude of parcels, baskets, and bags; she would be sighing over something, complaining that the train made her head ache, that she had spent so much money.... At the stations he would continually be having to run for boiling water, bread and butter. ...She wouldn't have dinner because of its being too dear....\\n\\\"She would begrudge me every farthing,\\\" he thought, with a glance at his wife. \\\"The lottery ticket is hers, not mine! Besides, what is the use of her going abroad? What does she want there? She would shut herself up in the hotel, and not let me out of her sight.... I know!\\\"\\nAnd for the first time in his life his mind dwelt on the fact that his wife had grown elderly and plain, and that she was saturated through and through with the smell of cooking, while he was still young, fresh, and healthy, and might well have got married again.\\n\\\"Of course, all that is silly nonsense,\\\" he thought; \\\"but...why should she go abroad? What would she make of it? And yet she would go, of course.... I can fancy.... In reality it is all one to her, whether it is Naples or Klin. She would only be in my way. I should be dependent upon her. I can fancy how, like a regular woman, she will lock the money up as soon as she gets it.... She will look after her relations and grudge me every farthing.\\\"\\nIvan Dmitritch thought of her relations. All those wretched brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles would come crawling about as soon as they heard of the winning ticket, would begin whining like beggars, and fawning upon them with oily, hypocritical smiles. Wretched, detestable people! If they were given anything, they would ask for more; while if they were refused, they would swear at them, slander them, and wish them every kind of misfortune.\\nIvan Dmitritch remembered his own relations, and their faces, at which he had looked impartially in the past, struck him now as repulsive and hateful.\\n\\\"They are such reptiles!\\\" he thought.\\nAnd his wife's face, too, struck him as repulsive and hateful. Anger surged up in his heart against her, and he thought malignantly:\\n\\\"She knows nothing about money, and so she is stingy. If she won it she would give me a hundred roubles, and put the rest away under lock and key.\\\"\\nAnd he looked at his wife, not with a smile now, but with hatred. She glanced at him too, and also with hatred and anger. She had her own daydreams, her own plans, her own reflections; she understood perfectly well what her husband's dreams were. She knew who would be the first to try to grab her winnings.\\n\\\"It's very nice making daydreams at other people's expense!\\\" is what her eyes expressed. \\\"No, don't you dare!\\\"\\nHer husband understood her look; hatred began stirring again in his breast, and in order to annoy his wife he glanced quickly, to spite her at the fourth page on the newspaper and read out triumphantly:\\n\\\"Series 9,499, number 46! Not 26!\\\"\\nHatred and hope both disappeared at once, and it began immediately to seem to Ivan Dmitritch and his wife that their rooms were dark and small and low-pitched, that the supper they had been eating was not doing them good, but Lying heavy on their stomachs, that the evenings were long and wearisome. . . .\\n\\\"What the devil's the meaning of it?\\\" said Ivan Dmitritch, beginning to be ill-humored.

For reasons which will presently appear, I will withhold his real name and titles, and call him Lieutenant General Lord Arthur Scoresby, V.C., K.C.B., etc., etc., etc. What a fascination there is in a renowned name! There sat the man, in actual flesh, whom I had heard of so many thousands of times since that day, thirty years before, when his name shot suddenly to the zenith from a Crimean battlefield, to remain forever celebrated. It was food and drink to me to look, and look, and look at that demigod; scanning, searching, noting: the quietness, the reserve, the noble gravity of his countenance; the simple honesty that expressed itself all over him; the sweet unconsciousness of his greatness\\u2014unconsciousness of the hundreds of admiring eyes fastened upon him, unconsciousness of the deep, loving, sincere worship welling out of the breasts of those people and flowing toward him.\\nThe clergyman at my left was an old acquaintance of mine\\u2014clergyman now, but had spent the first half of his life in the camp and field, and as an instructor in the military school at Woolwich. Just at the moment I have been talking about, a veiled and singular light glimmered in his eyes, and he leaned down and muttered confidentially to me\\u2014indicating the hero of the banquet with a gesture:\\n\\\"Privately\\u2014he's an absolute fool.\\\"\\nThis verdict was a great surprise to me. If its subject had been Napoleon, or Socrates, or Solomon, my astonishment could not have been greater. Two things I was well aware of: that the Reverend was a man of strict veracity, and that his judgement of men was good. Therefore I knew, beyond doubt or question, that the world was mistaken about this hero: he was a fool. So I meant to find out, at a convenient moment, how the Reverend, all solitary and alone, had discovered the secret.\\nSome days later the opportunity came, and this is what the Reverend told me.\\nAbout forty years ago I was an instructor in the military academy at Woolwich. I was present in one of the sections when young Scoresby underwent his preliminary examination. I was touched to the quick with pity; for the rest of the class answered up brightly and handsomely, while he\\u2014why, dear me, he didn't know anything, so to speak. He was evidently good, and sweet, and lovable, and guileless; and so it was exceedingly painful to see him stand there, as serene as a graven image, and deliver himself of answers which were veritably miraculous for stupidity and ignorance. All the compassion in me was aroused in his behalf. I said to myself, when he comes to be examined again, he will be flung over, of course; so it will be simply a harmless act of charity to ease his fall as much as I can. I took him aside, and found that he knew a little of C\\u00e6sar's history; and as he didn't know anything else, I went to work and drilled him like a galley slave on a certain line of stock questions concerning C\\u00e6sar which I knew would be used. If you'll believe me, he went through with flying colors on examination day! He went through on that purely superficial \\\"cram,\\\" and got compliments too, while others, who knew a thousand times more than he, got plucked. By some strangely lucky accident\\u2014an accident not likely to happen twice in a century\\u2014he was asked no question outside of the narrow limits of his drill.\\nIt was stupefying. Well, all through his course I stood by him, with something of the sentiment which a mother feels for a crippled child; and he always saved himself\\u2014just by miracle, apparently.\\nNow of course the thing that would expose him and kill him at last was mathematics. I resolved to make his death as easy as I could; so I drilled him and crammed him, and crammed him and drilled him, just on the line of questions which the examiners would be most likely to use, and then launching him on his fate. Well, sir, try to conceive of the result: to my consternation, he took the first prize! And with it he got a perfect ovation in the way of compliments.\\nSleep? There was no more sleep for me for a week. My conscience tortured me day and night. What I had done I had done purely through charity, and only to ease the poor youth's fall\\u2014I never had dreamed of any such preposterous result as the thing that had happened. I felt as guilty and miserable as the creator of Frankenstein. Here was a woodenhead whom I had put in the way of glittering promotions and prodigious responsibilities, and but one thing could happen: he and his responsibilities would all go to ruin together at the first opportunity.\\nThe Crimean war had just broken out. Of course there had to be a war, I said to myself: we couldn't have peace and give this donkey a chance to die before he is found out. I waited for the earthquake. It came. And it made me reel when it did come. He was actually gazetted to a captaincy in a marching regiment! Better men grow old and gray in the service before they climb to a sublimity like that. And who could ever have foreseen that they would go and put such a load of responsibility on such green and inadequate shoulders? I could just barely have stood it if they had made him a cornet; but a captain\\u2014think of it! I thought my hair would turn white.\\nConsider what I did\\u2014I who so loved repose and inaction. I said to myself, I am responsible to the country for this, and I must go along with him and protect the country against him as far as I can. So I took my poor little capital that I had saved up through years of work and grinding economy, and went with a sigh and bought a cornetcy in his regiment, and away we went to the field.\\nAnd there\\u2014oh dear, it was awful. Blunders? Why, he never did anything but blunder. But, you see, nobody was in the fellow's secret\\u2014everybody had him focused wrong, and necessarily misinterpreted his performance every time\\u2014consequently they took his idiotic blunders for inspirations of genius; they did, honestly! His mildest blunders were enough to make a man in his right mind cry; and they did make me cry\\u2014and rage and rave too, privately. And the thing that kept me always in a sweat of apprehension was the fact that every fresh blunder he made increased the luster of his reputation! I kept saying to myself, he'll get so high, that when discovery does finally come, it will be like the sun falling out of the sky.\\nHe went right along up, from grade to grade, over the dead bodies of his superiors, until at last, in the hottest moment of the battle of ------- down went our colonel, and my heart jumped into my mouth, for Scoresby was next in rank! Now for it, said I; we'll all land in Sheol in ten minutes, sure.\\nThe battle was awfully hot; the allies were steadily giving way all over the field. Our regiment occupied a position that was vital; a blunder now must be destruction. At this crucial moment, what does this immortal fool do but detach the regiment from its place and order a charge over a neighboring hill where there wasn't a suggestion of an enemy! \\\"There you go!\\\" I said to myself; \\\"this is the end at last.\\\"\\nAnd away we did go, and were over the shoulder of the hill before the insane movement could be discovered and stopped. And what did we find? An entire and unsuspected Russian army in reserve! And what happened? We were eaten up? That is necessarily what would have happened in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. But no, those Russians argued that no single regiment would come browsing around there at such a time. It must be the entire English army, and that the sly Russian game was detected and blocked; so they turned tail, and away they went, pell-mell, over the hill and down into the field, in wild confusion, and we after them; they themselves broke the solid Russian center in the field, and tore through, and in no time there was the most tremendous rout you ever saw, and the defeat of the allies was turned into a sweeping and splendid victory! Marshal Canrobert looked on, dizzy with astonishment, admiration,and delight; and sent right off for Scoresby, and hugged him, and decorated him on the field, in presence of all the armies!\\nAnd what was Scoresby's blunder that time? Merely the mistaking his right hand for his left\\u2014that was all. An order had come to him to fall back and support our right; and instead, he fell forward and went over the hill to the left. But the name he won that day as a marvelous military genius filled the world with his glory, and that glory will never fade while history books last.\\nHe is just as good and sweet and lovable and unpretending as a man can be, but he doesn't know enough to come in when it rains. Now that is absolutely true. He is the supremest ass in the universe; and until half an hour ago nobody knew it but himself and me. He has been pursued, day by day and year by year, by a most phenomenal and astonishing luckiness. He has been a shining soldier in all our wars for a generation; he has littered his whole military life with blunders, and yet has never committed one that didn't make him a knight or a baronet or a lord or something. Look at his breast; why, he is just clothed in domestic and foreign decorations. Well, sir, every one of them is the record of some shouting stupidity or other; and taken together, they are proof that the very best thing in all this world that can befall a man is to be born lucky.

Incredibly, he ascends further in rank due to his irrational mistakes being misinterpreted as displays of genius by others.\\n\\nDuring a critical battle, Scoreby's blunder leads to a charge in the wrong direction, thankfully stumbling into a heavily armed, unsuspected Russian army. Yet, through some extraordinary luck, the Russians retreat, allowing the English army to claim a remarkable victory. Scoresby's mistake is again misunderstood as brilliant strategy, raising his reputation even higher.\\n\\nIn the end, the clergyman admits that while Scoresby is genuine, kind, and unassuming, he possesses no actual military intelligence, consistently relying on sheer chance and luck to advance his career. The story concludes with the shocking revelation that Scoresby himself and the clergyman are the only ones aware of his foolishness. Regardless, his luck is seen as a testament to his success, proving that being born lucky is the greatest attribute of all.\", \"story_token_count\": 2368, \"summary_gpt_3_5_token_count\": 455, \"summary_gpt_3_5_t_14_token_count\": 593}, {\"Title\": \"My Cheesecake-Shaped Poverty\", \"Author\": \"Haruki Murakami\", \"story\": \"The Triangle Zone was our name for the place. I couldn\\u2019t think of any better name for it. I mean, the area was a perfect triangle, as if someone had drawn it out. And she and I lived there, on that land. This was back in 1973 or \\u201974.\\n\\nWhen I say \\u201cTriangle Zone,\\u201d don\\u2019t go picturing a kind of delta. The Triangle Zone we lived in was much narrower, more like a wedge. Imagine, say, a round, full-sized cheesecake. Cut it into twelve equal pieces with a knife so it\\u2019s like the face of a clock. What you\\u2019d end up with, of course, are twelve slices of thirty degrees each at the tip. Place one of these on a plate and, as you sip your tea, take a good hard look at it. That tapered end of the thin slice of cake? That\\u2019s exactly the shape of the Triangle Zone I\\u2019m talking about.\\n\\nO.K., so how did such a weirdly shaped plot of land come about? Well you might ask. Or maybe not. Either way\\u2019s fine with me, since I don\\u2019t know the answer. I asked some of the neighbors about it, but all I found out was that it had been shaped like a triangle long, long ago, was a triangle now, and would probably\\u2014far, far into the future\\u2014remain a triangle. People there didn\\u2019t seem to want to talk about this Triangle Zone, or even think about it. For them, it was like talking about a wart behind your ear. Better left undiscussed. Probably because of its weird shape.\\n\\nRailroad lines ran along either side of the Triangle Zone, one a national railway line, the other a private line. The two lines ran parallel for a while, then at the very tip of the wedge formed a junction where it was as if they were ripped apart, branching off at strange angles, one north and one south. It was quite a sight to see. Whenever I gazed at the trains whizzing by at the tip of the Triangle Zone, I felt as if I were standing on the bridge of a destroyer slicing its way through the ocean waves.\\n\\nIn terms of livability, the Triangle Zone was appalling. First of all, there was the obvious noise level. But what do you expect? How could it not be earsplitting to live hemmed in between two railroad lines? Open the front door and there was a train roaring by; open a window at the back of the house and yet another train would thunder by, right before your eyes. And when I say \\u201cright before your eyes,\\u201d I\\u2019m not exaggerating. The trains were so close that I could look the passengers in the eye and nod a greeting. Really something, now that I think about it.\\n\\nYou\\u2019d assume that it would be quiet after the last train of the night had passed by, right? I thought so, too, before I moved there. Problem was, there was no such thing as a last train. The last passenger train was just before 1 A.M., but then came the late-night freight trains. And, once they\\u2019d finished rolling by, at dawn, the next day\\u2019s passenger trains would start up again. It was an endless repeat of this, day after day.\\n\\nTalk about crazy.\\n\\nWe picked this place to live in for one simple reason: it was dirt cheap. It was a detached house with three rooms, its own bath, and even a small garden, all for about the same price as renting a studio apartment. Since it was a stand-alone house, we could bring our cat along, too. It was as if the place had been specially made, just for us. We\\u2019d only recently got married, and, not to brag or anything, but we could very well have been featured in the Guinness Book of Records under \\u201cWorld\\u2019s Poorest Couple.\\u201d We saw the house listed in the window of a real-estate agent\\u2019s office near the station. At least as far as the rent and the layout of the rooms were concerned, this was a lucky find. Astonishing, even.\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, cheap it is. For sure,\\u201d the bald real-estate agent said. \\u201cBut I have to warn you\\u2014it\\u2019s really noisy. As long as you can stand that, you could call it a lucky find.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWould you mind showing it to us?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cSure. But can\\u2019t the two of you just go? I get a headache every time I go to that place.\\u201d\\n\\nHe handed me the keys and drew a map. What an easygoing agent.\\n\\nOn the map, the Triangle Zone didn\\u2019t look far from the station, but, when we actually walked to it, it took forever. We had to detour around the railroad tracks, cross an overpass, and trudge up and down a somewhat filthy hill before we finally arrived at the rear of the Triangle Zone. There wasn\\u2019t a store in sight. A totally seedy neighborhood.\\n\\nMy wife and I went into the house at the very tip of the Triangle Zone and stayed for about an hour, just hanging out. During this time, trains kept on rumbling past. Whenever an express train roared by, the windows would rattle. We couldn\\u2019t hear each other while a train was passing. We\\u2019d be talking and then would have to stop until it was gone. We\\u2019d resume talking when it got quiet, only to be interrupted a moment later by yet another train. Choppy, interrupted communication \\u00e0 la Jean-Luc Godard.\\n\\nAside from the noise, the house wasn\\u2019t so bad. The structure itself was old-fashioned and in need of some serious repair, but on the plus side it had a tokonoma recessed alcove and a small outside sitting area attached to the house, and had a nice feel to it. Spring light shining in through the windows formed little sunny squares on the tatami. It was a lot like the house I\\u2019d lived in, years ago, when I was little. \\u201cLet\\u2019s take it,\\u201d I said. \\u201cI know it\\u2019s noisy, but we\\u2019ll get used to it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIf that\\u2019s what you think, I\\u2019m O.K. with it,\\u201d she said.\\n\\n\\u201cSitting here together like this, it feels like we\\u2019re married, our own family.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, we are married.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, yeah. True enough,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nWe went back to the real-estate agency and told the bald agent that we\\u2019d take it.\\n\\n\\u201cIsn\\u2019t it too noisy?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, it is, but we\\u2019ll get used to it,\\u201d I said.\\n\\nThe agent took off his glasses, wiped them with a tissue, took a sip of tea from his teacup, put his glasses back on, and looked at me.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, \\u2019cause you\\u2019re young,\\u201d he said.\\n\\n\\u201cRight,\\u201d I replied.\\n\\nAnd we filled out the rental agreement.\\n\\nA friend\\u2019s little minivan was more than enough for our move. Futons, clothes, a lamp, a few books, and a cat\\u2014that was the extent of our belongings. Nothing else. No radio or TV. No washer or dining table or gas stove or telephone or kettle or vacuum cleaner. That was how poor we were. So our move, such as it was, took only half an hour. Life can be simpler if you don\\u2019t have much money.\\n\\nWhen the friend who helped us move took one look at our new dwelling, hemmed in by railroad lines, he was aghast. After we\\u2019d unloaded everything, he turned to me and said something, but a passing express train drowned out his words.\\n\\n\\u201cDid you say something?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople really live in a place like this, huh?\\u201d he commented, impressed.\\n\\nWe ended up living in that house for two years.\\n\\nIt was a poorly built house in a way, since wind blew in through cracks and gaps all over the place. Pleasant enough in the summer, but, come winter, it was hell. With no money to buy a space heater, my wife and I and the cat would crawl under the futons once the sun set, literally clinging to each other to keep warm. Many a time we\\u2019d wake up to find the water in the kitchen faucet frozen solid.\\n\\nOnce winter passed, the spring would come. And spring was a lovely season. She and I and the cat would breathe a sigh of relief. In April, the railroads went on strike for a few days, and we were ecstatic. Not a single train came rumbling by all day. We carried the cat down to the railroad tracks and sat there sunning ourselves. It was so quiet it was as if we were sitting at the bottom of a lake.

Madame Henriette had allowed her husband to return alone to their estate in Calvados, where some business required his attention, and had come to spend a few days in Paris with her sister. Night came on. In the quiet parlor Madame Roubere was reading in the twilight in an absent-minded way, raising her eyes whenever she heard a sound.\\nAt last, she heard a ring at the door, and her sister appeared, wrapped in a travelling cloak. And without any formal greeting, they clasped each other in an affectionate embrace, only desisting for a moment to give each other another hug. Then they talked about their health, about their respective families, and a thousand other things, gossiping, jerking out hurried, broken sentences as they followed each other about, while Madame Henriette was removing her hat and veil.\\nIt was now quite dark. Madame Roubere rang for a lamp, and as soon as it was brought in, she scanned her sister's face, and was on the point of embracing her once more. But she held back, scared and astonished at the other's appearance.\\nOn her temples Madame Letore had two large locks of white hair. All the rest of her hair was of a glossy, raven-black hue; but there alone, at each side of her head, ran, as it were, two silvery streams which were immediately lost in the black mass surrounding them. She was, nevertheless, only twenty-four years old, and this change had come on suddenly since her departure for Switzerland.\\nWithout moving, Madame Roubere gazed at her in amazement, tears rising to her eyes, as she thought that some mysterious and terrible calamity must have befallen her sister. She asked:\\n\\\"What is the matter with you, Henriette?\\\"\\nSmiling with a sad face, the smile of one who is heartsick, the other replied:\\n\\\"Why, nothing, I assure you. Were you noticing my white hair?\\\"\\nBut Madame Roubere impetuously seized her by the shoulders, and with a searching glance at her, repeated:\\n\\\"What is the matter with you? Tell me what is the matter with you. And if you tell me a falsehood, I'll soon find it out.\\\"\\nThey remained face to face, and Madame Henriette, who looked as if she were about to faint, had two pearly tears in the corners of her drooping eyes.\\nHer sister continued:\\n\\\"What has happened to you? What is the matter with you? Answer me!\\\"\\nThen, in a subdued voice, the other murmured:\\n\\\"I have--I have a lover.\\\"\\nAnd, hiding her forehead on the shoulder of her younger sister, she sobbed.\\nThen, when she had grown a little calmer, when the heaving of her breast had subsided, she commenced to unbosom herself, as if to cast forth this secret from herself, to empty this sorrow of hers into a sympathetic heart.\\nThereupon, holding each other's hands tightly clasped, the two women went over to a sofa in a dark corner of the room, into which they sank, and the younger sister, passing her arm over the elder one's neck, and drawing her close to her heart, listened.\\n\\\"Oh! I know that there was no excuse for me; I do not understand myself, and since that day I feel as if I were mad. Be careful, my child, about yourself--be careful! If you only knew how weak we are, how quickly we yield, and fall. It takes so little, so little, so little, a moment of tenderness, one of those sudden fits of melancholy which come over you, one of those longings to open, your arms, to love, to cherish something, which we all have at certain moments.\\n\\\"You know my husband, and you know how fond I am of him; but he is mature and sensible, and cannot even comprehend the tender vibrations of a woman's heart. He is always the same, always good, always smiling, always kind, always perfect. Oh! how I sometimes have wished that he would clasp me roughly in his arms, that he would embrace me with those slow, sweet kisses which make two beings intermingle, which are like mute confidences! How I have wished that he were foolish, even weak, so that he should have need of me, of my caresses, of my tears!\\n\\\"This all seems very silly; but we women are made like that. How can we help it?\\n\\\"And yet the thought of deceiving him never entered my mind. Now it has happened, without love, without reason, without anything, simply because the moon shone one night on the Lake of Lucerne.\\n\\\"During the month when we were travelling together, my husband, with his calm indifference, paralyzed my enthusiasm, extinguished my poetic ardor. When we were descending the mountain paths at sunrise, when as the four horses galloped along with the diligence, we saw, in the transparent morning haze, valleys, woods, streams, and villages, I clasped my hands with delight, and said to him: 'How beautiful it is, dear! Give me a kiss! Kiss me now!' He only answered, with a smile of chilling kindliness: 'There is no reason why we should kiss each other because you like the landscape.'\\n\\\"And his words froze me to the heart. It seems to me that when people love each other, they ought to feel more moved by love than ever, in the presence of beautiful scenes.\\n\\\"In fact, I was brimming over with poetry which he kept me from expressing. I was almost like a boiler filled with steam and hermetically sealed.\\n\\\"One evening (we had for four days been staying in a hotel at Fluelen) Robert, having one of his sick headaches, went to bed immediately after dinner, and I went to take a walk all alone along the edge of the lake.\\n\\\"It was a night such as one reads of in fairy tales. The full moon showed itself in the middle of the sky; the tall mountains, with their snowy crests, seemed to wear silver crowns; the waters of the lake glittered with tiny shining ripples. The air was mild, with that kind of penetrating warmth which enervates us till we are ready to faint, to be deeply affected without any apparent cause. But how sensitive, how vibrating the heart is at such moments! how quickly it beats, and how intense is its emotion!\\n\\\"I sat down on the grass, and gazed at that vast, melancholy, and fascinating lake, and a strange feeling arose in me; I was seized with an insatiable need of love, a revolt against the gloomy dullness of my life. What! would it never be my fate to wander, arm in arm, with a man I loved, along a moon-kissed bank like this? Was I never to feel on my lips those kisses so deep, delicious, and intoxicating which lovers exchange on nights that seem to have been made by God for tenderness? Was I never to know ardent, feverish love in the moonlit shadows of a summer's night?\\n\\\"And I burst out weeping like a crazy woman. I heard something stirring behind me. A man stood there, gazing at me. When I turned my head round, he recognized me, and, advancing, said:\\n\\\"'You are weeping, madame?'\\n\\\"It was a young barrister who was travelling with his mother, and whom we had often met. His eyes had frequently followed me.\\n\\\"I was so confused that I did not know what answer to give or what to think of the situation. I told him I felt ill.\\n\\\"He walked on by my side in a natural and respectful manner, and began talking to me about what we had seen during our trip. All that I had felt he translated into words; everything that made me thrill he understood perfectly, better than I did myself. And all of a sudden he repeated some verses of Alfred de Musset. I felt myself choking, seized with indescribable emotion. It seemed to me that the mountains themselves, the lake, the moonlight, were singing to me about things ineffably sweet.\\n\\\"And it happened, I don't know how, I don't know why, in a sort of hallucination.\\n\\\"As for him, I did not see him again till the morning of his departure.\\n\\\"He gave me his card!\\\"\\nAnd, sinking into her sister's arms, Madame Letore broke into groans-- almost into shrieks.\\nThen, Madame Roubere, with a self-contained and serious air, said very gently:\\n\\\"You see, sister, very often it is not a man that we love, but love itself.

H. Munro\", \"story\": \"Theodoric Voler had been brought up, from infancy to the confines of middle age, by a fond mother whose chief solicitude had been to keep him screened from what she called the coarser realities of life. When she died she left Theodoric alone in a world that was as real as ever, and a good deal coarser than he considered it had any need to be. To a man of his temperament and upbringing even a simple railway journey was crammed with petty annoyances and minor discords, and as he settled himself down in a second-class compartment one September morning he was conscious of ruffled feelings and general mental discomposure. He had been staying at a country vicarage, the inmates of which had been certainly neither brutal nor bacchanalian, but their supervision of the domestic establishment had been of that lax order which invites disaster. The pony carriage that was to take him to the station had never been properly ordered, and when the moment for his departure drew near, the handyman who should have produced the required article was nowhere to be found. In this emergency Theodoric, to his mute but very intense disgust, found himself obliged to collaborate with the vicar's daughter in the task of harnessing the pony, which necessitated groping about in an ill-lighted outbuilding called a stable, and melling very like one--except in patches where it smelled of mice. Without being actually afraid of mice, Theodoric classed them among the coarser incidents of life, and considered that Providence, with a little exercise of moral courage, might long ago have recognized that they were not indispensable, and have withdrawn them from circulation. As the train glided out of the station Theodoric's nervous imagination accused himself of exhaling a weak odor of stable yard, and possibly of displaying a moldy straw or two on his unusually well-brushed garments. Fortunately the only other occupation of the compartment, a lady of about the same age as himself, seemed inclined for slumber rather than scrutiny; the train was not due to stop till the terminus was reached, in about an hour's time, and the carriage was of the oId-fashioned sort that held no communication with a corridor, therefore no further traveling companions were likely to intrude on Theodoric's semiprivacy. And yet the train had scarcely attained its normal speed before he became reluctantly but vividly aware that he was not alone with the slumbering lady; he was not even alone in his own clothes. A warm, creeping movement over his flesh betrayed the unwelcome and highly resented presence, unseen but poignant, of a strayed mouse, that had evidently dashed into its present retreat during the episode of the pony harnessing. Furtive stamps and shakes and wildly directed pinches failed to dislodge the intruder, whose motto, indeed, seemed to be Excelsior; and the lawful occupant of the clothes lay back against the cushions and endeavored rapidly to evolve some means for putting an end to the dual ownership. It was unthinkable that he should continue for the space of a whole hour in the horrible position of a Rowton House for vagrant mice already his imagination had at least doubled the numbers of the alien invasion. On the other hand, nothing less drastic than partial disrobing would ease him of his tormentor, and to undress in the presence of a lady, even for so laudable a purpose, was an idea that made his ear tips tingle in a blush of abject shame. He had never heen able to bring himself even to the mild exposure of openwork socks in the presence of the fair sex. And yet--the lady in this case was to all appearances soundly and securely asleep; the mouse, on the other hand, seemed to be trying to crowd a wanderjahr into a few strenuous minutes. If there is any truth in the theory of transmigration, this particular mouse must certainly have been in a former state a member of the Alpine Club. Sometimes in its eagerness it lost its footing and slipped for half an inch or so; and then, in fright, or more probably temper, it bit. Theodoric was goaded into the most audacious undertaking of his life. Crimsoning to the hue of a beetroot and keeping an agonized watch on his slumbering fellow traveler, he swiftly and noiselessly secured the ends of his railway rug to the racks on either side of the carriage, so that a substantial curtain hung athwart the compartment. In the narrow dressing room that he had thus improvised he proceeded with violent haste to extricate himself partially and the mouse entirely from the surrounding casings of tweed and half-wool. As the unraveled mouse gave a wild leap to the floor, the rug, slipping its fastening at either end, also came down with a heart-curdling flop, and almost simultaneously the awakened sleeper opened her eyes. With a movement almost quicker than the mouse's, Theodoric pounced on the rug and hauled its ample folds chin-high over his dismantled person as he collapsed into the farther corner of the carriage. The blood raced and beat in the veins of his neck and forehead, while he waited dumbly for the communication cord to be pulled. The lady, however, contented herself with a silent stare at her strangely muffled companion. How much had she seen, Theodoric queried to himself; and in any case what on earth must she think of his present posture?\\n\\\"I think I have caught a chill,\\\" he ventured desperately.\\n\\\"Really, I'm sorry,\\\" she replied. \\\"I was just going to ask you if you would open this window.\\\"\\n\\\"I fancy it's malaria,\\\" he added, his teeth chattering slightly, as much from fright as from a desire to support his theory.\\n\\\"I've got some brandy in my holdall, if you'll kindly reach it down for me,\\\" said his companion.\\n\\\"Not for worlds--I mean, I never take anything for it,\\\" he assured her earnestly.\\n\\\"I suppose you caught it in the tropics?\\\"\\nTheodoric, whose acquaintance with the tropics was limited to an annual present of a chest of tea from an uncle in Ceylon, felt that even the malaria was slipping from him. Would it be possible, he wondered to disclose the real state of affairs to her in small installments?\\n\\\"Are you afraid of mice?\\\" he ventured, growing, if possible, more scarlet in the face.\\n\\\"Not unless they came in quantities. Why do you ask?\\\"\\n\\\"I had one crawling inside my clothes just now,\\\" said Theodoric in a voice that hardly seemed his own. \\\"It was a most awkward situation.\\\"\\n\\\"It must have been, if you wear your clothes at all tight,\\\" she observed. \\\"But mice have strange ideas of comfort.\\\"\\n\\\"I had to get rid of it while you were asleep,\\\" he continued. Then, with a gulp, he added, \\\"It was getting rid of it that brought me to-to this.\\\"\\n\\\"Surely leaving off one small mouse wouldn't bring on a chill,\\\" she exclaimed, with a levity that Theodoric accounted abominable.\\nEvidently she had detected something of his predicament, and was enjoying his confusion. All the blood in his body seemed to have mobilized in one concentrated blush, and an agony of abasement, worse than a myriad mice, crept up and down over his soul. And then, as reflection began to assert itself, sheer terror took the place of humiliation. With every minute that passed the train was rushing nearer to the crowded and bustling terminus, where dozens of prying eyes would be exchanged for the one paralyzing pair that watched him from the farther corner of the carriage. There was one slender, despairing chance, which the next few minutes must decide. His fellow traveler might relapse into a blessed slumber. But as the minutes throbbed by that chance ebbed away. The furtive glance which Theodoric stole at her from time to time disclosed only an unwinking wakefulness.\\n\\\"I think we must be getting near now,\\\" she presently observed.\\nTheodoric had already noted with growing terror the recurring stacks of small, ugly dwellings that heralded the journey's end. The words acted as a signal. Like a hunted beast breaking cover and dashing madly toward some other haven of momentary safety he threw aside his rug, and struggled frantically into his disheveled garments. He was conscious of dull suburban stations racing past the window, of a choking, hammering sensation in his throat and heart, and of an icy silence in that corner toward which he dared not look. Then as he sank back in his seat, clothed and almost delirious, the train slowed down to a final crawl, and the woman spoke.\\n\\\"Would you be so kind,\\\" she asked, \\\"as to get me a porter to put me into a cab? It's a shame to trouble you when you're feeling unwell, but being blind makes one so helpless at a railway station.\\\"\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Theodoric Voler, a man who has been sheltered from the harsh realities of life, finds himself on a train journey filled with annoyances.

He desperately tries to remove it without alerting the sleeping lady in the compartment with him.

However, the rug falls and the lady wakes up, leaving Theodoric in an embarrassing and compromising situation. But instead of mocking him, she calmly offers him brandy for his supposed chill.

H. Munro\", \"story\": \"It was Mrs. Packletide's pleasure and intention that she should shoot a tiger. Not that the lust to kill had suddenly descended on her, or that she felt that she would leave India safer and more wholesome than she had found it, with one fraction less of wild beast per million of inhabitants. The compelling motive for her sudden deviation towards the footsteps of Nimrod was the fact that Loona Bimberton had recently been carried eleven miles in an aeroplane by an Algerian aviator, and talked of nothing else; only a personally procured tiger-skin and a heavy harvest of Press photographs could successfully counter that sort of thing. Mrs. Packletide had already arranged in her mind the lunch she would give at her house in Curzon Street, ostensibly in Loona Bimberton's honour, with a tiger-skin rug occupying most of the foreground and all of the conversation. She had also already designed in her mind the tiger-claw broach that she was going to give Loona Bimberton on her next birthday. In a world that is supposed to be chiefly swayed by hunger and by love Mrs. Packletide was an exception; her movements and motives were largely governed by dislike of Loona Bimberton.\\nCircumstances proved propitious. Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without over-much risk or exertion, and it so happened that a neighbouring village could boast of being the favoured rendezvous of an animal of respectable antecedents, which had been driven by the increasing infirmities of age to abandon game-killing and confine its appetite to the smaller domestic animals. The prospect of earning the thousand rupees had stimulated the sporting and commercial instinct of the villagers; children were posted night and day on the outskirts of the local jungle to head the tiger back in the unlikely event of his attempting to roam away to fresh hunting-grounds, and the cheaper kinds of goats were left about with elaborate carelessness to keep him satisfied with his present quarters. The one great anxiety was lest he should die of old age before the date appointed for the memsahib's shoot. Mothers carrying their babies home through the jungle after the day's work in the fields hushed their singing lest they might curtail the restful sleep of the venerable herd-robber.\\nThe great night duly arrived, moonlit and cloudless. A platform had been constructed in a comfortable and conveniently placed tree, and thereon crouched Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin. A goat, gifted with a particularly persistent bleat, such as even a partially deaf tiger might be reasonably expected to hear on a still night, was tethered at the correct distance. With an accurately sighted rifle and a thumb-nail pack of patience cards the sportswoman awaited the coming of the quarry.\\n\\\"I suppose we are in some danger?\\\" said Miss Mebbin.\\nShe was not actually nervous about the wild beast, but she had a morbid dread of performing an atom more service than she had been paid for.\\n\\\"Nonsense,\\\" said Mrs. Packletide; \\\"it's a very old tiger. It couldn't spring up here even if it wanted to.\\\"\\n\\\"If it's an old tiger I think you ought to get it cheaper. A thousand rupees is a lot of money.\\\"\\nLouisa Mebbin adopted a protective elder-sister attitude towards money in general, irrespective of nationality or denomination. Her energetic intervention had saved many a rouble from dissipating itself in tips in some Moscow hotel, and francs and centimes clung to her instinctively under circumstances which would have driven them headlong from less sympathetic hands. Her speculations as to the market depreciation of tiger remnants were cut short by the appearance on the scene of the animal itself. As soon as it caught sight of the tethered goat it lay flat on the earth, seemingly less from a desire to take advantage of all available cover than for the purpose of snatching a short rest before commencing the grand attack.\\n\\\"I believe it's ill,\\\" said Louisa Mebbin, loudly in Hindustani, for the benefit of the village headman, who was in ambush in a neighbouring tree.\\n\\\"Hush!\\\" said Mrs. Packletide, and at that moment the tiger commenced ambling towards his victim.\\n\\\"Now, now!\\\" urged Miss Mebbin with some excitement; \\\"if he doesn't touch the goat we needn't pay for it.\\\" (The bait was an extra.)\\nThe rifle flashed out with a loud report, and the great tawny beast sprang to one side and then rolled over in the stillness of death. In a moment a crowd of excited natives had swarmed on to the scene, and their shouting speedily carried the glad news to the village, where a thumping of tom-toms took up the chorus of triumph. And their triumph and rejoicing found a ready echo in the heart of Mrs. Packletide; already that luncheon-party in Curzon Street seemed immeasurably nearer.\\nIt was Louisa Mebbin who drew attention to the fact that the goat was in death-throes from a mortal bullet-wound, while no trace of the rifle's deadly work could be found on the tiger. Evidently the wrong animal had been hit, and the beast of prey had succumbed to heart-failure, caused by the sudden report of the rifle, accelerated by senile decay. Mrs. Packletide was pardonably annoyed at the discovery; but, at any rate, she was the possessor of a dead tiger, and the villagers, anxious for their thousand rupees, gladly connived at the fiction that she had shot the beast. And Miss Mebbin was a paid companion. Therefore did Mrs. Packletide face the cameras with a light heart, and her pictured fame reached from the pages of the Texas Weekly Snapshot to the illustrated Monday supplement of the Novoe Vremya. As for Loona Bimberton, she refused to look at an illustrated paper for weeks, and her letter of thanks for the gift of a tiger-claw brooch was a model of repressed emotions. The luncheon-party she declined; there are limits beyond which repressed emotions become dangerous.\\nFrom Curzon Street the tiger-skin rug travelled down to the Manor House, and was duly inspected and admired by the county, and it seemed a fitting and appropriate thing when Mrs. Packletide went to the County Costume Ball in the character of Diana. She refused to fall in, however, with Clovis's tempting suggestion of a primeval dance party, at which every one should wear the skins of beasts they had recently slain. \\\"I should be in rather a Baby Bunting condition,\\\" confessed Clovis, \\\"with a miserable rabbit-skin or two to wrap up in, but then,\\\" he added, with a rather malicious glance at Diana's proportions, \\\"my figure is quite as good as that Russian dancing boy's.\\\"\\n\\\"How amused every one would be if they knew what really happened,\\\" said Louisa Mebbin a few days after the ball.\\n\\\"What do you mean?\\\" asked Mrs. Packletide quickly.\\n\\\"How you shot the goat and frightened the tiger to death,\\\" said Miss Mebbin, with her disagreeably pleasant laugh.\\n\\\"No one would believe it,\\\" said Mrs. Packletide, her face changing colour as rapidly as though it were going through a book of patterns before post-time.\\n\\\"Loona Bimberton would,\\\" said Miss Mebbin. Mrs. Packletide's face settled on an unbecoming shade of greenish white.\\n\\\"You surely wouldn't give me away?\\\" she asked.\\n\\\"I've seen a week-end cottage near Darking that I should rather like to buy,\\\" said Miss Mebbin with seeming irrelevance. \\\"Six hundred and eighty, freehold. Quite a bargain, only I don't happen to have the money.\\\"\\n*\\nLouisa Mebbin's pretty week-end cottage, christened by her \\\"Les Fauves,\\\" and gay in summer-time with its garden borders of tiger-lilies, is the wonder and admiration of her friends.\\n\\\"It is a marvel how Louisa manages to do it,\\\" is the general verdict.\\nMrs. Packletide indulges in no more big-game shooting.\\n\\\"The incidental expenses are so heavy,\\\" she confides to inquiring friends.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"Mrs. Packletide, driven by her dislike for Loona Bimberton's recent fame, decides to shoot a tiger in order to outdo Loona. She offers a thousand rupees for the opportunity to shoot a tiger, and the villagers in a neighboring village set up a plan to attract an old tiger to their area. On the night of the hunt, Mrs. Packletide and her companion, Louisa Mebbin, wait in a tree with a tethered goat as bait. Mrs. Packletide successfully shoots a tiger, but it is later discovered that the tiger died from a heart attack caused by the sound of the rifle, and not from the gunshot wound. However, the villagers and Mrs. Packletide keep up the fiction that she shot the tiger, and she becomes famous for her accomplishment. Loona Bimberton, resentful of Mrs. Packletide's success, refuses to accept a tiger-claw brooch as a gift and declines an invitation to a lunch party. Mrs. Packletide displays the tiger-skin rug and attends a costume ball dressed as Diana. Louisa Mebbin, Mrs. Packletide's paid companion, later threatens to expose the truth about the hunt, but instead uses her insider knowledge to purchase a cottage.

Villagers keep the tiger nearby with domestic goats as prey until the scheduled hunt arrives. On the night of the hunt, Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebbin, hide in a tree with a goat tethered at a suitable distance. Baited by the goat, the tiger approaches, and Mrs. Packletide shoots it.

Aurelio Escovar, a dentist without a degree, and a very early riser, opened his office at six. He took some false teeth, still mounted in their plaster mold, out of the glass case and put on the table a fistful of instruments which he arranged in size order, as if they were on display. He wore a collarless striped shirt, closed at the neck with a golden stud, and pants held up by suspenders He was erect and skinny, with a look that rarely corresponded to the situation, the way deaf people have of looking.\\nWhen he had things arranged on the table, he pulled the drill toward the dental chair and sat down to polish the false teeth. He seemed not to be thinking about what he was doing, but worked steadily, pumping the drill with his feet, even when he didn't need it.\\nAfter eight he stopped for a while to look at the sky through the window, and he saw two pensive buzzards who were drying themselves in the sun on the ridgepole of the house next door. He went on working with the idea that before lunch it would rain again. The shrill voice of his elevenyear-old son interrupted his concentration.\\n\\\"Papa.\\\"\\n\\\"What?\\\"\\n\\\"The Mayor wants to know if you'll pull his tooth.\\\"\\n\\\"Tell him I'm not here.\\\"\\nHe was polishing a gold tooth. He held it at arm's length, and examined it with his eyes half closed. His son shouted again from the little waiting room.\\n\\\"He says you are, too, because he can hear you.\\\"\\nThe dentist kept examining the tooth. Only when he had put it on the table with the finished work did he say:\\n\\\"So much the better.\\\"\\nHe operated the drill again. He took several pieces of a bridge out of a cardboard box where he kept the things he still had to do and began to polish the gold.\\n\\\"Papa.\\\"\\n\\\"What?\\\"\\nHe still hadn't changed his expression.\\n\\\"He says if you don't take out his tooth, he'll shoot you.\\\"\\nWithout hurrying, with an extremely tranquil movement, he stopped pedaling the drill, pushed it away from the chair, and pulled the lower drawer of the table all the way out. There was a revolver. \\\"O.K.,\\\" he said. \\\"Tell him to come and shoot me.\\\"\\nHe rolled the chair over opposite the door, his hand resting on the edge of the drawer. The Mayor appeared at the door. He had shaved the left side of his face, but the other side, swollen and in pain, had a five-day-old beard. The dentist saw many nights of desperation in his dull eyes. He closed the drawer with his fingertips and said softly:\\n\\\"Sit down.\\\"\\n\\\"Good morning,\\\" said the Mayor.\\n\\\"Morning,\\\" said the dentist.\\nWhile the instruments were boiling, the Mayor leaned his skull on the headrest of the chair and felt better. His breath was icy. It was a poor office: an old wooden chair, the pedal drill, a glass case with ceramic bottles. Opposite the chair was a window with a shoulder-high cloth curtain. When he felt the dentist approach, the Mayor braced his heels and opened his mouth.\\nAurelio Escovar turned his head toward the light. After inspecting the infected tooth, he closed the Mayor's jaw with a cautious pressure of his fingers.\\n\\\"It has to be without anesthesia,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"Why?\\\"\\n\\\"Because you have an abscess.\\\"\\nThe Mayor looked him in the eye. \\\"All right,\\\" he said, and tried to smile. The dentist did not return the smile. He brought the basin of sterilized instruments to the worktable and took them out of the water with a pair of cold tweezers, still without hurrying. Then he pushed the spittoon with the tip of his shoe, and went to wash his hands in the washbasin. He did all this without looking at the Mayor. But the Mayor didn't take his eyes off him.\\nIt was a lower wisdom tooth. The dentist spread his feet and grasped the tooth with the hot forceps. The Mayor seized the arms of the chair, braced his feet with all his strength, and felt an icy void in his kidneys, but didn't make a sound. The dentist moved only his wrist. Without rancor, rather with a bitter tenderness, he said:\\n\\\"Now you'll pay for our twenty dead men.\\\"\\nThe Mayor felt the crunch of bones in his jaw, and his eyes filled with tears. But he didn't breathe until he felt the tooth come out. Then he saw it through his tears. It seemed so foreign to his pain that he failed to understand his torture of the five previous nights.\\nBent over the spittoon, sweating, panting, he unbuttoned his tunic and reached for the handkerchief in his pants pocket. The dentist gave him a clean cloth.\\n\\\"Dry your tears,\\\" he said.\\nThe Mayor did. He was trembling. While the dentist washed his hands, he saw the crumbling ceiling and a dusty spider web with spider's eggs and dead insects. The dentist returned, drying his hands. \\\"Go to bed,\\\" he said, \\\"and gargle with salt water.\\\" The Mayor stood up, said goodbye with a casual military salute, and walked toward the door, stretching his legs, without buttoning up his tunic.\\n\\\"Send the bill,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"To you or the town?\\\"\\nThe Mayor didn't look at him.

There the warden handed Jimmy his pardon, which had been signed that morning by the governor. Jimmy took it in a tired kind of way. He had served nearly ten months of a four year sentence. He had expected to stay only about three months, at the longest. When a man with as many friends on the outside as Jimmy Valentine had is received in the \\\"stir\\\" it is hardly worth while to cut his hair.\\n\\n\\\"Now, Valentine,\\\" said the warden, \\\"you'll go out in the morning. Brace up, and make a man of yourself. You're not a bad fellow at heart. Stop cracking safes, and live straight.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me?\\\" said Jimmy, in surprise. \\\"Why, I never cracked a safe in my life.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" laughed the warden. \\\"Of course not. Let's see, now. How was it you happened to get sent up on that Springfield job? Was it because you wouldn't prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high-toned society? Or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you? It's always one or the other with you innocent victims.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me?\\\" said Jimmy, still blankly virtuous. \\\"Why, warden, I never was in Springfield in my life!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Take him back, Cronin!\\\" said the warden, \\\"and fix him up with outgoing clothes. Unlock him at seven in the morning, and let him come to the bull-pen. Better think over my advice, Valentine.\\\"\\n\\nAt a quarter past seven on the next morning Jimmy stood in the warden's outer office. He had on a suit of the villainously fitting, ready-made clothes and a pair of the stiff, squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests.\\n\\nThe clerk handed him a railroad ticket and the five-dollar bill with which the law expected him to rehabilitate himself into good citizenship and prosperity. The warden gave him a cigar, and shook hands. Valentine, 9762, was chronicled on the books, \\\"Pardoned by Governor,\\\" and Mr. James Valentine walked out into the sunshine.\\n\\nDisregarding the song of the birds, the waving green trees, and the smell of the flowers, Jimmy headed straight for a restaurant. There he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine\\u2014followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him. From there he proceeded leisurely to the depot. He tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door, and boarded his train. Three hours set him down in a little town near the state line. He went to the caf\\u00e9 of one Mike Dolan and shook hands with Mike, who was alone behind the bar.\\n\\n\\\"Sorry we couldn't make it sooner, Jimmy, me boy,\\\" said Mike. \\\"But we had that protest from Springfield to buck against, and the governor nearly balked. Feeling all right?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Fine,\\\" said Jimmy. \\\"Got my key?\\\"\\n\\nHe got his key and went upstairs, unlocking the door of a room at the rear. Everything was just as he had left it. There on the floor was still Ben Price's collar-button that had been torn from that eminent detective's shirt-band when they had overpowered Jimmy to arrest him.\\n\\nPulling out from the wall a folding-bed, Jimmy slid back a panel in the wall and dragged out a dust-covered suit-case. He opened this and gazed fondly at the finest set of burglar's tools in the East. It was a complete set, made of specially tempered steel, the latest designs in drills, punches, braces and bits, jimmies, clamps, and augers, with two or three novelties, invented by Jimmy himself, in which he took pride. Over nine hundred dollars they had cost him to have made at ----, a place where they make such things for the profession.\\n\\nIn half an hour Jimmy went down stairs and through the caf\\u00e9. He was now dressed in tasteful and well-fitting clothes, and carried his dusted and cleaned suit-case in his hand.\\n\\n\\\"Got anything on?\\\" asked Mike Dolan, genially.\\n\\n\\\"Me?\\\" said Jimmy, in a puzzled tone. \\\"I don't understand. I'm representing the New York Amalgamated Short Snap Biscuit Cracker and Frazzled Wheat Company.\\\"\\n\\nThis statement delighted Mike to such an extent that Jimmy had to take a seltzer-and-milk on the spot. He never touched \\\"hard\\\" drinks.\\n\\nA week after the release of Valentine, 9762, there was a neat job of safe-burglary done in Richmond, Indiana, with no clue to the author. A scant eight hundred dollars was all that was secured. Two weeks after that a patented, improved, burglar-proof safe in Logansport was opened like a cheese to the tune of fifteen hundred dollars, currency; securities and silver untouched. That began to interest the rogue-catchers. Then an old-fashioned bank-safe in Jefferson City became active and threw out of its crater an eruption of bank-notes amounting to five thousand dollars. The losses were now high enough to bring the matter up into Ben Price's class of work. By comparing notes, a remarkable similarity in the methods of the burglaries was noticed. Ben Price investigated the scenes of the robberies, and was heard to remark:\\n\\n\\\"That's Dandy Jim Valentine's autograph. He's resumed business. Look at that combination knob\\u2014jerked out as easy as pulling up a radish in wet weather. He's got the only clamps that can do it. And look how clean those tumblers were punched out! Jimmy never has to drill but one hole. Yes, I guess I want Mr. Valentine. He'll do his bit next time without any short-time or clemency foolishness.\\\"\\n\\nBen Price knew Jimmy's habits. He had learned them while working up the Springfield case. Long jumps, quick get-aways, no confederates, and a taste for good society\\u2014these ways had helped Mr. Valentine to become noted as a successful dodger of retribution. It was given out that Ben Price had taken up the trail of the elusive cracksman, and other people with burglar-proof safes felt more at ease.\\n\\nOne afternoon Jimmy Valentine and his suit-case climbed out of the mail-hack in Elmore, a little town five miles off the railroad down in the black-jack country of Arkansas. Jimmy, looking like an athletic young senior just home from college, went down the board side-walk toward the hotel.\\n\\nA young lady crossed the street, passed him at the corner and entered a door over which was the sign, \\\"The Elmore Bank.\\\" Jimmy Valentine looked into her eyes, forgot what he was, and became another man. She lowered her eyes and coloured slightly. Young men of Jimmy's style and looks were scarce in Elmore.\\n\\nJimmy collared a boy that was loafing on the steps of the bank as if he were one of the stockholders, and began to ask him questions about the town, feeding him dimes at intervals. By and by the young lady came out, looking royally unconscious of the young man with the suit-case, and went her way.\\n\\n\\\"Isn't that young lady Polly Simpson?\\\" asked Jimmy, with specious guile.\\n\\n\\\"Naw,\\\" said the boy. \\\"She's Annabel Adams. Her pa owns this bank. What'd you come to Elmore for? Is that a gold watch-chain? I'm going to get a bulldog. Got any more dimes?\\\"\\n\\nJimmy went to the Planters' Hotel, registered as Ralph D. Spencer, and engaged a room. He leaned on the desk and declared his platform to the clerk. He said he had come to Elmore to look for a location to go into business. How was the shoe business, now, in the town? He had thought of the shoe business. Was there an opening?\\n\\nThe clerk was impressed by the clothes and manner of Jimmy. He, himself, was something of a pattern of fashion to the thinly gilded youth of Elmore, but he now perceived his shortcomings. While trying to figure out Jimmy's manner of tying his four-in-hand he cordially gave information.\\n\\nYes, there ought to be a good opening in the shoe line. There wasn't an exclusive shoe-store in the place. The dry-goods and general stores handled them. Business in all lines was fairly good. Hoped Mr. Spencer would decide to locate in Elmore. He would find it a pleasant town to live in, and the people very sociable.\\n\\nMr. Spencer thought he would stop over in the town a few days and look over the situation. No, the clerk needn't call the boy. He would carry up his suit-case, himself; it was rather heavy.\\n\\nMr. Ralph Spencer, the ph\\u0153nix that arose from Jimmy Valentine's ashes\\u2014ashes left by the flame of a sudden and alterative attack of love\\u2014remained in Elmore, and prospered. He opened a shoe-store and secured a good run of trade.\\n\\nSocially he was also a success, and made many friends. And he accomplished the wish of his heart. He met Miss Annabel Adams, and became more and more captivated by her charms.\\n\\nAt the end of a year the situation of Mr. Ralph Spencer was this: he had won the respect of the community, his shoe-store was flourishing, and he and Annabel were engaged to be married in two weeks. Mr. Adams, the typical, plodding, country banker, approved of Spencer. Annabel's pride in him almost equalled her affection. He was as much at home in the family of Mr. Adams and that of Annabel's married sister as if he were already a member.\\n\\nOne day Jimmy sat down in his room and wrote this letter, which he mailed to the safe address of one of his old friends in St. Louis:\\n \\n\\n        Dear Old Pal:\\n\\n        I want you to be at Sullivan's place, in Little Rock, next Wednesday night, at nine o'clock.

I'll bring along the tools with me.\\n\\n        Your old friend,\\n\\n        Jimmy.\\n         \\n\\nOn the Monday night after Jimmy wrote this letter, Ben Price jogged unobtrusively into Elmore in a livery buggy. He lounged about town in his quiet way until he found out what he wanted to know. From the drug-store across the street from Spencer's shoe-store he got a good look at Ralph D. Spencer.\\n\\n\\\"Going to marry the banker's daughter are you, Jimmy?\\\" said Ben to himself, softly. \\\"Well, I don't know!\\\"\\n\\nThe next morning Jimmy took breakfast at the Adamses. He was going to Little Rock that day to order his wedding-suit and buy something nice for Annabel. That would be the first time he had left town since he came to Elmore. It had been more than a year now since those last professional \\\"jobs,\\\" and he thought he could safely venture out.\\n\\nAfter breakfast quite a family party went downtown together\\u2014Mr. Adams, Annabel, Jimmy, and Annabel's married sister with her two little girls, aged five and nine. They came by the hotel where Jimmy still boarded, and he ran up to his room and brought along his suit-case. Then they went on to the bank. There stood Jimmy's horse and buggy and Dolph Gibson, who was going to drive him over to the railroad station.\\n\\nAll went inside the high, carved oak railings into the banking-room\\u2014Jimmy included, for Mr. Adams's future son-in-law was welcome anywhere. The clerks were pleased to be greeted by the good-looking, agreeable young man who was going to marry Miss Annabel. Jimmy set his suit-case down. Annabel, whose heart was bubbling with happiness and lively youth, put on Jimmy's hat, and picked up the suit-case. \\\"Wouldn't I make a nice drummer?\\\" said Annabel. \\\"My! Ralph, how heavy it is? Feels like it was full of gold bricks.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lot of nickel-plated shoe-horns in there,\\\" said Jimmy, coolly, \\\"that I'm going to return. Thought I'd save express charges by taking them up. I'm getting awfully economical.\\\"\\n\\nThe Elmore Bank had just put in a new safe and vault. Mr. Adams was very proud of it, and insisted on an inspection by every one. The vault was a small one, but it had a new, patented door. It fastened with three solid steel bolts thrown simultaneously with a single handle, and had a time-lock. Mr. Adams beamingly explained its workings to Mr. Spencer, who showed a courteous but not too intelligent interest. The two children, May and Agatha, were delighted by the shining metal and funny clock and knobs.\\n\\nWhile they were thus engaged Ben Price sauntered in and leaned on his elbow, looking casually inside between the railings. He told the teller that he didn't want anything; he was just waiting for a man he knew.\\n\\nSuddenly there was a scream or two from the women, and a commotion. Unperceived by the elders, May, the nine-year-old girl, in a spirit of play, had shut Agatha in the vault. She had then shot the bolts and turned the knob of the combination as she had seen Mr. Adams do.\\n\\nThe old banker sprang to the handle and tugged at it for a moment. \\\"The door can't be opened,\\\" he groaned. \\\"The clock hasn't been wound nor the combination set.\\\"\\n\\nAgatha's mother screamed again, hysterically.\\n\\n\\\"Hush!\\\" said Mr. Adams, raising his trembling hand. \\\"All be quite for a moment. Agatha!\\\" he called as loudly as he could. \\\"Listen to me.\\\" During the following silence they could just hear the faint sound of the child wildly shrieking in the dark vault in a panic of terror.\\n\\n\\\"My precious darling!\\\" wailed the mother. \\\"She will die of fright! Open the door! Oh, break it open! Can't you men do something?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There isn't a man nearer than Little Rock who can open that door,\\\" said Mr. Adams, in a shaky voice. \\\"My God! Spencer, what shall we do? That child\\u2014she can't stand it long in there. There isn't enough air, and, besides, she'll go into convulsions from fright.\\\"\\n\\nAgatha's mother, frantic now, beat the door of the vault with her hands. Somebody wildly suggested dynamite. Annabel turned to Jimmy, her large eyes full of anguish, but not yet despairing. To a woman nothing seems quite impossible to the powers of the man she worships.\\n\\n\\\"Can't you do something, Ralph \\u2014 try, won't you?\\\"\\n\\nHe looked at her with a queer, soft smile on his lips and in his keen eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Annabel,\\\" he said, \\\"give me that rose you are wearing, will you?\\\"\\n\\nHardly believing that she heard him aright, she unpinned the bud from the bosom of her dress, and placed it in his hand. Jimmy stuffed it into his vest-pocket, threw off his coat and pulled up his shirt-sleeves. With that act Ralph D. Spencer passed away and Jimmy Valentine took his place.\\n\\n\\\"Get away from the door, all of you,\\\" he commanded, shortly.\\n\\nHe set his suit-case on the table, and opened it out flat. From that time on he seemed to be unconscious of the presence of any one else. He laid out the shining, queer implements swiftly and orderly, whistling softly to himself as he always did when at work. In a deep silence and immovable, the others watched him as if under a spell.\\n\\nIn a minute Jimmy's pet drill was biting smoothly into the steel door. In ten minutes\\u2014breaking his own burglarious record\\u2014he threw back the bolts and opened the door.\\n\\nAgatha, almost collapsed, but safe, was gathered into her mother's arms.\\n\\nJimmy Valentine put on his coat, and walked outside the railings towards the front door. As he went he thought he heard a far-away voice that he once knew call \\\"Ralph!\\\" But he never hesitated.\\n\\nAt the door a big man stood somewhat in his way.\\n\\n\\\"Hello, Ben!\\\" said Jimmy, still with his strange smile. \\\"Got around at last, have you? Well, let's go. I don't know that it makes much difference, now.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then Ben Price acted rather strangely.\\n\\n\\\"Guess you're mistaken, Mr. Spencer,\\\" he said. \\\"Don't believe I recognize you. Your buggy's waiting for you, ain't it?\\\"\\n\\nAnd Ben Price turned and strolled down the street.\", \"summary_gpt_3_5\": \"In this story, a man named Jimmy Valentine is released from prison on a pardon from the governor after serving nearly ten months of a four-year sentence.

I appreciate you. I can take it from here.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, right,\\u201d she said. \\u201cYou think I\\u2019d let you finish this alone? I\\u2019ve done too much for you already to just walk away.
